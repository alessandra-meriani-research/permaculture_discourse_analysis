"text453.13","tiene más que ver con el sentir que con el pensar es la voz de la naturaleza que nos habla desde la sabiduría de nuestro ser más profundo"
"text453.14","en nuestra sociedad lo irracional está bastante mal visto y todo conocimiento adquirido por este medio es comúnmente descartado por ser considerado mucho menos fiable y legítimo que el obtenido mediante procesos mentales más “civilizados”"

"text453.17","hacer consciente esta conexión con el resto de seres conlleva un mayor respeto hacia la tierra entendiendo que sólo somos una parte más de ésta y que la podemos utilizar pero sólo hasta donde sea realmente necesario y nada más en vez de usarla para seguir alimentando la autodestructiva rueda del capitalismo"
