by papprentice Leave a Comment  If you’ve seen my post about my simple plant propagation setup, you might have noticed that I have comfrey growing there. The thing is, I can’t get enough of this plant, no matter how much I produce it. I use it as a dynamic accumulator in my food forest guilds, as fertilizer for my garden, to accelerate my composting process, as biomass for mulching, and to attract beneficial insects. It’s a versatile plant with many uses, including medicinal ones. Luckily, propagating comfrey is pretty simple. You dig the plant’s root, cut it into individual pieces, and plant it. After some time, each root piece becomes a plant on its own. It’s that easy. However, it’s time-sensitive, meaning you can’t do that at any time of the year. I had to learn this the hard way. Before I had my nursery set up, I would go to the nearby public land to get it. I never thought about timing, so I would just dig it on a sunny day once I had some free time, and then later, I would plant the individual root pieces in my food forest. It worked as a charm—it grew in my food forest. But, guess what, that was beginner’s luck. Encouraged by how easy it was, the next time/year, I doubled down and went to get a massive order of this nature’s finest plant. I dug and dug and filled multiple -gallon buckets with roots. Then, I planted them all across my food forest. After a while, I noticed that the cuttings were sprouting very sporadically. Something was wrong… It turns out I overlooked the ideal timing for propagating root cuttings, and was too quick to dig out roots that were still accumulating energy before they went dormant in winter. If I hate something with passion, it’s when I waste my most precious resource—time! I spent a good four to five hours on the whole project (digging, potting, preparing, and planting) only to realize that most of the effort was in vain. So, to prevent this type of mistake in the future, I created a plant propagation calendar that shows the timing of all the relevant plant propagation techniques. (Click on the image below to access the calendar)   I’ve extracted the information from the AHS Plant Propagation book (which I wholeheartedly recommend if you want to improve your skills in this area) and organized it according to the recommended timing. It was an arduous task, but now that it’s done, I’m happy to share my creation with you—no strings attached. Here’s a short video explaining what it’s all about and how to use it.   All right, I hope this gets you started on your plant propagation journey.

by papprentice Leave a Comment  From all the inputs you’ll need to establish your food forest, there is one that could break the bank more than any other. I’m talking about the sheer amount of plants you’ll need in order to grow your perennial permaculture paradise. The $$ numbers can be brutal when you do some math on the plants required. Let’s say you need to plant a few lemon balm patches as part of the guilds around your apple trees. You want to add some aromatic plants to confuse the pests. For each patch like that, you’ll need, let’s say, six lemon balm (trans)plants. I’m not sure how much a lemon balm plant costs in your neck of the woods, but let’s say it’s $. That comes to $ for one patch. And you need at least ten like this for your ten apple trees – $. It turns out that you might need to work all day at your job just to buy lemon balms for your guilds. I said the numbers can be brutal. That’s why, in his book Creating a Forest Garden, Martin Crawford recommends having an on-site nursery bed where you can propagate your own herbaceous perennials. On my micro-farm, I’ve implemented Martin’s advice and developed a system to generate transplants of comfrey, mint, and lemon balm on demand. The whole setup takes m ( ft) of space, and each year, I make myself a hundred or so plants. Mind you, I’m not an expert on plant propagation, and on most days, on average, I get just h to work on my farm. Still, I produce at least some of the plants I need for my food forest. My ethos is: simplify but get results! I explain my system and yearly workflow in this video:   In summary, in my permaculture nursery, I use a simple, low-cost setup to propagate herbaceous perennials like comfrey, mint, and lemon balm. My system revolves around growing “mother plants” in containers, which then I divide or use for cuttings to produce new plants. I start by filling large containers with quality soil and planting the mother plants—some, like comfrey, I forage from the wild, while others like mint and lemon balm come from my existing garden stock. Once the plants have grown for a full season, I propagate them in the fall. For comfrey, I take root cuttings—small sections of the root that will sprout into new plants. For mint and lemon balm, I divide the established plants and transfer them into smaller individual pots. Typically, I prepare around  pots of each, letting them root and develop through the fall and into the next growing season. I keep the potted cuttings in a shaded, protected area and water as necessary. These young plants don’t require much sun but do need shelter and consistent moisture to establish strong roots. Once they’re well-rooted, and have grown into a strong (trans)plant I can then transplant them into the food forest at any time of year, although I prefer fall for planting, as it gives them time to settle in before the next growing season. This system is very easy to scale—whenever I want to expand, I simply add more containers for new mother plants. It’s a simple, regenerative approach to growing a steady supply of perennial plants for the garden or food forest! All right, I hope you found this permaculture nursery tip helpful and that it inspired you to implement something similar on your own land.

by papprentice Leave a Comment As someone who is constantly juggling various personal, professional, and homestead tasks, there’s one permaculture principle that’s proven to be incredibly important in my day-to-day life. It’s the principle of ‘the least effort for the most effect.’ Essentially it’s this idea that you want to work in a way where you get great results for a minimum investment of your resources (time, labor, money). I mean, who wouldn’t love that? Now, the problem with this is figuring out how exactly to do things in this ‘least effort for the most effect’ way. So today, I want to showcase the principle in action on my farm and give you at least one idea of what you could do, and as a byproduct, you’ll get an endless supply of free liquid fertilizer. In one of my earlier videos, I showed you my small permaculture nursery setup where I’m propagating, amongst other things, comfrey. And now I’ll show you how that nursery (comfrey propagation pot) is connected to my biofertilizer production (plastic drum) and the workflow/protocol behind it. Click the video below to learn more:  As you can see from the video, I really do put minimum effort into this. I cut the comfrey foliage two or more times a year, put it in a plastic drum that’s m ( ft) away, and let it ferment while I do other things. In about two months, I get this liquid fertilizer filled with nutrients for my garden crops. Total effort required = less than  min and some light labor to harvest and put comfrey into the plastic drum, Effect = free nutrient-rich locally sourced fertilizer that would cost real $$ to buy. It’s like making money out of thin air. Here’s a practical action oriented workflow with a timeline you can follow to make the comfrey biofertilizer (click on the image to enlarge): The workflow goes like this: first you’ll need to establish your comfrey propagation setup – . build herbaceous perennials propagation bed or pot – . then you’ll have to acquire comfrey plants (get the nursery stock – comfrey mother plants) and . pot and grow them through the season. During the season you’ll be able to . harvest comfrey foliage two to three times, and then . use that material to make your biofertilizer. See the timeline for an overview of the timing of each project. Note that you can get nursery stock material (comfrey plant) at any time of the year. Also, once you have the plant material growing, making the biofertilizer is a year-round project – you just fill it up, let it sit, and use as needed in the garden. If I were to put all the tasks in year, the above timeline is how I’d execute this. From the permaculture perspective notice that there are two permaculture design connections happening here that are making this work effortlessly. First, I found a way to supply the needs of one element – the biofertilizer production (plastic drum) – with the yields of another element – nursery (comfrey propagation pot) – and by doing so created a closed loop. So instead of importing the resource (nutrient-rich plant material) that my biofertilizer production needs, I supplied it with something I already have going. Second, I’ve put those two elements next to each other, given that one feeds the other, so I can do less work. All right, I hope this was insightful and that you’ll start your own biofertilizer production.

"It feels strange to say it out loud: we moved. We left our little  m² permaculture garden. We left Switzerland. And we started over, again. If you’ve been following us for a while, you’ve probably noticed the silence. No new updates from the garden. No fresh videos showing our seasonal shifts. And that’s because, behind the scenes, our lives were changing completely. On December st, , we found our forever home in France. After months of searching and months more of battling bank paperwork as independents, we bought a house in the middle of the forest, in a quiet corner of Les Vosges, France. The property is over , m², nearly . hectares, with , m² of forest alone. It’s more than we ever dreamed. And somehow, exactly what we were looking for. Back in Switzerland, we had carved out a beautiful life. A lake nearby. A compact but thriving permaculture garden. A community that had grown around it. But something inside both of us kept whispering: Let’s go deeper! What if we had space to not just garden, but to regenerate? Not just to grow food, but to steward land, plant forests, raise animals, and build something that would last beyond us? We were craving silence. Space. Wildness. Freedom. And then we found this place (video below has English subtitles!). When we first stepped onto the property, we knew it was different. It wasn’t just the land, it was the feeling. A resounding feeling in all of us that this is where we are meant to be. There’s a greenhouse already in place, tucked against a small hill. Rocky terrain laced with iron. Clay and sand, and a natural water source. A pond that isn’t technically ours, yet, but one that holds stories older than just this property. And a house. Solid and beautiful, built in the s by people who cared. The owner even built the stone walls around the garden himself. It felt lived-in. Held. Loved. That mattered to us. We’ve only scratched the surface of this land. It holds secrets in its soil and in its stones. Ancient ones. The trees here are different. The soil is different. The air is damp, lush, and alive. We’re at nearly the same elevation as before (m), but the climate couldn’t be more different. Here the plants speak a different language. We’re learning. Slowly. Many of the trees we don’t yet know by name. Some feel familiar, hazelnuts, crabapple, oak, blackberries, and pines. Others are still strangers. If you spot anything familiar in our photos or videos, please let us know in the comments. One of the most surprising joys of this shift has been to see the abundance of life. Not just the plants, but the animals. Since arriving, we’ve seen wild boars, foxes, deer, and even a nutria by the pond. We’ve watched crayfish scuttle across the road and in the stream next to the house. Lizards warming themselves on sun-soaked stones. And insects, so many insects!! Bees, beetles, wasps, dragonflies, and the occasional tick (of course). We’ve also met our neighbors: cows. Dozens of them. Calm, quiet, curious. They graze just over the fence and seem content to share the silence (these ones don’t have bells like in Switzerland!). We’re not starting from scratch, exactly. But we are starting fresh. The greenhouse will soon be full of sprouts. The rocky ground will need compost, mulch, cover crops, and layers of care. The forest will evolve into something between wild woodland and an edible paradise. I dream of a food forest full of hazelnuts, berries, medicinal plants, and trees for firewood. And yes, we’ve already built a composting system and garden bed! (If you’re curious how we built this system, check out our DIY Pallet Compost Guide for the full how-to.) There’s also a small wooden outbuilding waiting to become a home for rabbits, chickens, ducks, and maybe, eventually, a few sheep. These aren’t just for food or company. In permaculture, every animal has a role to play: managing pests, fertilizing soil, trimming grass, or teaching us patience. This place doesn’t just hold potential. It holds history. We’ve found old dry-stone walls, giant carved stones that feel like something from a Celtic storybook. And according to local lore, monks lived in these woods over a thousand years ago. They practiced a form of large-scale permaculture before the word existed, cycling fish through ponds, using nutrient-rich water to grow food, and shaping the land with intention. There’s something deeply humbling about walking in their footsteps. About touching the same stones. About continuing the work, even if it’s under a different name now. Even though we’ve moved, we haven’t let go of everything. We’re keeping the Swiss garden alive, at least for now. Partly because it’s a beautiful place. But also because it allows us to compare, reflect, and learn. Two different climates. Two different soils. Two parallel experiments in regeneration. We’ll be watching how seeds grow here versus there. How medicinal herbs adapt. How fruit trees thrive. There’s something poetic about growing the same plant in two places and seeing how it expresses itself. This isn’t a holiday home. It’s not a side project. We moved. Fully. We left Switzerland. The old apartment where Sean grew up is gone. Our routines, our assumptions, even our habits are shifting in a massive way. This is our new base. Our family home. The place where we’ll raise our three son’s, host friends, plant trees, and slowly shape a life aligned with the values we’ve been cultivating for years: simplicity, regeneration, seasonal living, and community. More videos. More stories. More learning. We’ll be sharing the big changes, like when we build the food forest or install the animal systems. But we’ll also share the small ones, like when we transplant wild raspberries, or we spot a deer at dusk, or the misty land in the morning cold. If there’s anything you’re curious about, just ask. If you know a plant we don’t, tell us. If you’ve made a similar move, we’d love to hear your story. Thank you for being here. Truly. This move was years in the making. It took courage, risk, and a lot of trust. But now that we’re here, with the soil beneath our feet and the stars above us, we know we made the right choice. We’re not just gardening anymore.
We’re tending a way of life. — And most of all, tell us what you’d love to see next. We’re listening.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Natural cleaning products are advertised everywhere, but are they worth it? Before I ever lived in the countryside or studied permaculture, I worked as a house cleaner. And even back then, I chose to use only natural cleaning products, partly because they were gentle, partly because I knew that was a great selling point for my clients. But it wasn’t until I trained as a holistic health practictioner that I began to fully understand the deeper cost of conventional cleaning chemicals, their impact on our hormones, our lungs, our microbiome, and the long-term health of our families. Cleaning, for me, isn’t just about tidying the surfaces of a home. It’s an energetic act. A way to tend to the spaces that support us, without harming the systems that sustain life. That’s why I made the switch. Over time, I’ve found simple, natural products that not only clean beautifully but also align with the values I want to live by. Below, I’m sharing my favorites, how I use them, what they do best, and how they tie into a permaculture lifestyle. You’ve probably seen the headlines that chemical cleaners can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), irritate the skin and respiratory system, and pollute waterways. But the impacts go deeper: Most conventional cleaners include synthetic fragrances, endocrine disruptors, and ingredients that are toxic when inhaled or absorbed (it takes roughly  seconds for these chemicals to absorb through your skin!). These compounds accumulate over time, particularly in small or poorly ventilated homes. Chemical-based cleaning agents don’t just vanish down the drain. They enter greywater systems, disrupt aquatic ecosystems, and are often packaged in single-use plastics. Natural cleaners, by contrast, are simple, accessible, and often multipurpose. And most importantly, they work. Here’s what’s always in my cupboard, plus a few personal tips on how I use them. A thick, olive-based soap paste or liquid that’s as gentle as it is powerful. Uses: Tip: I mix a teaspoon of savon noir with warm water and spray it on aphids in the garden. It’s a natural insecticide that doesn’t harm beneficial bugs when used sparingly. This powder releases oxygen when mixed with warm water, like hydrogen peroxide, but dry. Uses: Tip: Pour a tablespoon into the kitchen sink drain, add hot water, and wait. It’s excellent at breaking down grease and organic build-up, without toxic fumes. The ultimate multipurpose scrub and deodorizer. Uses: Tip: Mix it with a few drops of essential oil and store it in a jar to make a gentle scouring powder. Acidic, antibacterial, and endlessly useful (except on marble or granite). Uses: Tip: I pour it into a spray bottle with orange peels and let it infuse for two weeks. It smells wonderful and works beautifully on countertops. Naturally antiseptic and brightening. Uses: Tip: Half a lemon dipped in salt makes a great natural scrubber for soap scum or mineral deposits. Citrus essential oils (like orange, lemon, or grapefruit) are uplifting, antibacterial, and dissolve grease. Uses: Tip: Save all your citrus peels in a jar, cover them with vinegar, and leave it to infuse for – weeks. Strain and dilute for a citrus-scented all-purpose spray. Add a therapeutic, antimicrobial edge to your cleaning. Just a few drops go a long way. Uses: Tip: Add a few drops of lavender oil to baking soda and sprinkle on rugs before vacuuming. A ready-made paste of natural abrasives, ideal for tougher jobs. Uses: Tip: A little goes a long way. Let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing for best results. Traditional hard soap made from olive oil, gentle and biodegradable. Uses: Derived from citrus fruit, an excellent natural descaler. Uses: Stronger than baking soda, better for heavy-duty cleaning. Uses: If you’re just starting out, you don’t need to buy everything at once. Most natural cleaning routines can begin with just a few basic ingredients. Here’s what I recommend for your starter kit: You can do a lot with these: laundry, surface cleaning, drain unclogging, stain removal, and even garden maintenance. The more you experiment, the more confident and creative you’ll become. Living in alignment with permaculture practices isn’t just about how we grow our food; it’s about how we care for our spaces, our bodies, and our communities. Cleaning might seem like a small thing, but it touches every part of our daily lives. Here’s how natural cleaning ties into the core permaculture ethics: Choosing biodegradable, plant-based cleaners protects the water, soil, and air from synthetic pollution. It also helps reduce packaging waste. Many natural products can be bought in bulk, or even made from scraps. Natural cleaners are safer for children, pets, and anyone with sensitivities. They support healthier homes by reducing toxic load, hormone disruptors, and allergens. These products are usually more affordable in the long run and reduce dependency on corporations or plastic-heavy supply chains. DIY cleaners also promote resourcefulness and community sharing. Swap recipes, buy ingredients together, or share what works with your neighbors. One of my favorite things about natural cleaning is how often the “waste” becomes a resource. Citrus peels become infused vinegar. Old t-shirts become rags. Ashes from the stove can scrub glass. It’s a beautiful loop. Switching to natural cleaning products isn’t just a sustainability hack; it’s a mindset shift. It’s about moving from convenience to consciousness, from overconsumption to sufficiency. You don’t have to be perfect. Just start with one swap. Maybe vinegar instead of a spray bottle full of mystery chemicals. Baking soda under the sink instead of bleach. A little jar of orange peel cleaner that reminds you of the seasons and the land you live on. Cleaning this way feels good. Not just because my home is fresh and sparkling, but because it feels aligned. Aligned with my health, the earth, and the kind of future I want to help build. Have you tried any of these natural cleaning product swaps? Do you have a favorite DIY recipe? I’d love to hear about your experience, what’s worked, what hasn’t, and what surprised you. And if you’re just getting started: welcome. You’re not alone. This is one small, powerful step toward living in harmony with the earth, and I’m so glad you’re taking it.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Walk past a garden border and you might spot them – slender green spikes that look a bit like grass until you look closer. Chives are easy to overlook, yet these modest onion family members have been quietly useful in gardens and kitchens for centuries. They’re the perfect starter herb for beginners, while still earning their keep in the gardens of green-thumbed experts. Botanically speaking, chives (Allium schoenoprasum) are related to onions, garlic, leeks, and scallions in the Amaryllidaceae family. “Allium” comes from the Latin for garlic, while “schoenoprasum” combines Greek words for “rush” and “leek” – basically “reed-like leek,” which makes sense when you see them growing. Unlike their stronger-flavored cousins, chives won’t make you cry or leave your breath reeking. They have hollow, tubular leaves that grow - inches tall in dense clumps. Around early summer, they send up slightly taller stalks with round purple flower heads. These pom-pom blooms are both exceedingly pretty and edible, with a stronger onion punch than the leaves. Bees love them as well. Chives don’t have the dramatic history of some herbs (nobody started wars over chives), but they’ve been useful kitchen companions across the Northern Hemisphere for thousands of years. They grow wild in Europe, Asia, and North America, often in damp meadows and near streams. The Romans probably brought cultivated chives to Britain, using them for cooking and medicine. Marco Polo mentioned finding them widely used across China during his travels. He apparently brought some Asian varieties back to Europe, though probably not with the fanfare of his other discoveries. Medieval monks grew chives in their gardens, valuing them both as food flavoring and medicine. Hildegard of Bingen, a pretty remarkable th-century abbess and herbalist, wrote that chives helped digestion and circulation – uses that modern research hasn’t completely dismissed. One strange bit of history comes from Romania, where they were hung in houses alongside garlic to ward off vampires. More practically, Dutch dairy farmers noticed that cows grazing on pastures with wild chives produced better-tasting milk, so they started deliberately planting them in their fields. In Swedish folk medicine, bunches of chives were hung around homes during illness, supposedly to prevent disease from spreading. Seems odd now, but the antimicrobial compounds in alliums might actually have helped a bit in crowded living conditions. Chives are remarkably low-maintenance plants that thrive across much of the Northern Hemisphere. Unlike fussier Mediterranean herbs that need hot, dry conditions, chives handle cool weather and cold winters without complaint. They’re often among the first herbs to pop up in spring, sometimes even pushing through late snow. They grow best in fairly rich, well-drained soil that stays consistently moist but not waterlogged. Full sun works in cooler climates, but they appreciate afternoon shade in hotter regions. Once established, they’re surprisingly drought-tolerant, though they’ll look prettier with regular water. Most commercial chives come from China, Japan, and parts of Europe, but they’re more commonly grown in home gardens than as major agricultural crops. Their short shelf life after cutting means locally-grown chives are usually best for cooking. What makes chives particularly good for home gardens is their perennial nature and compact growth habit. A single planting can produce harvests for many years, slowly expanding into larger clumps that can be divided and replanted. They don’t take up much space and work well in containers, too. Chives might not be medical powerhouses like garlic, but they pack surprising benefits into those slender leaves: In Russia, mothers would hang bunches of chives over a sick child’s bed to help with colds and respiratory infections. While this might sound like pure superstition, the volatile compounds released might have helped clear congestion somewhat, like a very mild natural vapor rub. Though less myth-laden than some herbs, chives have collected their fair share of folk beliefs and superstitions. In parts of Eastern Europe, people planted chives on graves to keep evil spirits away from the deceased. More likely, the smell deterred scavenging animals, but the spiritual protection story probably sounded better. Chinese tradition held that giving someone chives as a gift symbolized long life and endurance – logical when you consider how stubbornly perennial these plants are. They come back year after year without much fuss. European farmers sometimes hung bunches of chives in cow stalls when animals were sick. While they explained this as driving away evil spirits causing illness, the strong smell might have actually helped repel certain insects or parasites. One particularly odd belief from Eastern Europe warned that pregnant women shouldn’t cut chives because it could cause their baby to be born with a cleft palate. This superstition probably arose because chive leaves themselves are hollow and split – a classic case of sympathetic magic where like supposedly affects like. Swiss Alpine shepherds sometimes decorated their lead cow with a garland including chives during the ceremonial autumn descent from mountain pastures. This celebrated the herbs that had supposedly improved their milk throughout the summer grazing season. For beginning gardeners, chives are about as fool-proof as herbs get. Here’s how to succeed with minimal effort: Start with seeds, divisions, or small plants from a garden center. Seeds need to be started indoors about - weeks before the last frost, then transplanted outside once established. Divisions from existing plants establish quickly and give you harvestable leaves much faster. Plant them in soil with some compost mixed in, spacing plants about - inches apart. Water regularly until established. They like consistent moisture but won’t immediately die if you forget to water occasionally. Don’t overfertilize – too much nitrogen makes for floppy, weak growth. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is plenty. Harvest by cutting leaves about  inches above the soil line using scissors. This encourages fresh growth and prevents woody stems. Regular cutting keeps plants productive, but avoid taking more than a third of a plant at once. Every - years, divide established clumps in early spring or fall. This rejuvenates the plants, prevents overcrowding, and gives you more chives to plant elsewhere or share with neighbors. Consider growing both regular chives and garlic chives (Allium tuberosum). The latter have flat leaves instead of round ones, a mild garlic flavor, and pretty white flowers that bloom later in summer than regular chives do. Beyond sprinkling them on potatoes, this herb has several practical uses: Nothing about chives screams for attention. They’re not flashy, exotic, or trendy. But their steady presence in gardens across the Northern Hemisphere speaks to their genuine usefulness. What makes chives worth growing? They don’t need coddling or special treatment. They grow happily in average soil with moderate water. They survive winter freezes that kill other herbs. They deter some garden pests while attracting beneficial insects. And they provide fresh flavor for most of the growing season, often starting earlier than other herbs in spring. These modest plants connect modern gardeners to centuries of herbal tradition while requiring almost no special knowledge to grow successfully. Sometimes the most valuable additions to our gardens aren’t the showiest or most exotic, but the quietly reliable ones that simply do their jobs without demanding much in return. Chives and green onions (also called scallions) are both alliums with a mild onion flavor, but they differ in appearance, texture, and culinary use. Chives are thin, hollow, grass-like herbs typically used as a garnish; their flavor is delicate and best enjoyed raw. Green onions, on the other hand, have a white bulb and green stalks, both of which are edible and often used in cooking. They offer a stronger, more onion-like taste and hold up better to heat, making them more versatile in sautés, stir-fries, and soups.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
We have been growing thyme in our gardens and kitchens for thousands of years. This humble herb might not grab attention like flashy basil or towering rosemary, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in staying power. Walk through any herb garden, and you’ll likely find thyme tucked somewhere, often spilling over the edges of paths, releasing its distinctive scent when stepped on. Thyme belongs to the mint family, with common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) being the variety most often found in gardens and kitchens. Its name comes from the Greek word “thymos,” which means courage or strength – fitting for a plant that survives in some pretty harsh conditions. With tiny, oval leaves growing on woody stems and small purple, pink, or white flowers, thyme might look delicate, but don’t be fooled – this herb is tough as nails. The fragrance of thyme is unique – woody, slightly floral, with hints of lemon, pepper, and something distinctly earthy. Crush a leaf between your fingers, and you’ll understand why this herb has captivated cooks and healers for centuries. Thyme’s relationship with humans stretches back to ancient Egypt, where it was used in embalming rituals. The Egyptians believed its aromatic properties would help the spirit on its journey to the afterlife. No pressure, little herb. The ancient Greeks burned thyme as incense in their temples, believing its smoke purified the space. Greek soldiers bathed in thyme-infused water before battle, supposedly to infuse themselves with courage and vigor. This association with bravery continued with the Romans, who offered thyme to those going into battle. In medieval Europe, thyme took on new significance. Ladies embroidered thyme sprigs on scarves for their knights heading to the Crusades as symbols of courage. Thyme also gained a reputation for warding off nightmares when placed under pillows – a practice that persisted for centuries. One particularly interesting chapter in thyme’s history involves the Black Death. During this devastating plague, people would carry posies containing thyme and other strong-smelling herbs, believing they provided protection against the disease. Modern science has since shown that thyme does indeed have powerful antiseptic properties – those medieval folks were onto something. The th-century English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper wrote that thyme was “a noble strengthener of the lungs” – another traditional use that modern research has partly validated, as thyme can help with respiratory conditions. Thyme is native to the Mediterranean region, which explains why it loves the sun and hates soggy soil. Take a hike through the hills of Greece or southern France and you’ll spot thyme tucked between rocks, growing happily in places that would kill most garden plants. Today, thyme grows throughout Europe, North Africa, Asia, and North America, having been spread by centuries of human cultivation. It’s adapted to a surprising range of climates, though it generally prefers hot, sunny positions and well-drained soil. In gardens, thyme often finds a home in rock gardens, between paving stones, or as a low-growing ground cover. Some varieties even substitute for lawn grass in low-traffic areas, creating a fragrant carpet that releases its scent when walked upon. The plant’s natural habitat explains its growing preferences: thyme absolutely hates wet feet. Plant it in waterlogged soil, and it will quickly rot. But give it some sandy or gravelly soil and plenty of sun, and it will reward you with years of growth from a single planting. People have been using thyme to treat various ailments for centuries, long before anyone understood why it worked. Modern research has finally caught up with what our ancestors somehow figured out through trial and error. The secret behind thyme’s medicinal power is its essential oil, especially a compound called thymol. Here’s what traditional healers used thyme for: I’ve tried making thyme steam for stuffy sinuses (just put fresh thyme in a bowl of hot water and breathe in the steam), and while I can’t prove anything scientifically, it definitely made breathing easier! Being an ancient and widespread herb, thyme has gathered its share of curious beliefs and superstitions. In European folklore, thyme was thought to attract fairies to gardens. Some claimed that patches of wild thyme marked places where fairies danced under the full moon. This association led to the planting of thyme in gardens not just for practical purposes but as an invitation to beneficial fairy folk. Scottish highlanders brewed a tea of wild thyme to provide “second sight” or prophetic visions – a practice that probably had more to do with thyme’s mild mood-altering properties than actual clairvoyance. In some parts of England, it was believed that a patch of wild thyme growing on a hillside indicated buried treasure beneath – perhaps because the plant often grows on rocky, mineral-rich soil that might contain ore deposits. Many cultures associated thyme with transitions and passages. In addition to its role in Egyptian funerary practices, some European traditions included placing sprigs of thyme in coffins to assure a safe passage to the afterlife. More happily, thyme was also incorporated into wedding bouquets and decorations to ensure courage and strength in the marriage. Thyme ranks among the easiest herbs to grow, making it perfect for beginning gardeners. It asks little and gives much in return. Starting thyme from seed requires patience, as germination can be slow and somewhat unpredictable. Most gardeners start with small plants purchased from nurseries or cuttings from established plants, which root readily in moist soil. The key to growing thyme successfully lies in mimicking its natural Mediterranean habitat: full sun, excellent drainage, and not too much fertilizer or water. In fact, thyme develops more intense flavor when grown in somewhat poor soil and allowed to dry out between waterings. In colder regions, thyme may die back in winter but usually recovers in spring. After several years, plants often become woody and less productive, at which point it’s best to replace them with fresh ones. Harvest thyme just before it flowers for the most concentrated flavor. Morning harvesting, after the dew has dried but before the day heats up, captures the highest concentration of essential oils. While we now know thyme primarily as a culinary herb, its uses extend far beyond the kitchen: From ancient Egyptian tombs to modern kitchen gardens, thyme has proven itself one of our most enduring herbal companions. Its stubborn ability to thrive in tough conditions mirrors the resilience it brings to those who use it – whether as food, medicine, or simple garden beauty. Something about thyme’s subtle, complex fragrance continues to draw us back, generation after generation. Perhaps it’s the way it connects us to our ancestors, who gathered wild thyme from Mediterranean hillsides and discovered its remarkable properties through centuries of use. Small as it is, thyme reminds us that sometimes the most unassuming plants carry the most profound gifts. The next time you brush past it in a garden or sprinkle it into a soup, remember you’re participating in a human tradition spanning thousands of years and countless cultures – all centered around a tiny herb with outsized importance.;Jardin Feuilles de Vie
Stroll through any garden, and you might be lucky to spot calendula officinalis — with its vibrant orange and yellow petals radiating just like miniature suns. Often mistaken for the common marigold, this bright flower has been cherished for centuries for its powerful healing properties, culinary charm, and symbolic significance across cultures. Scientifically known as Calendula officinalis, this member of the daisy family has been called “pot marigold,” “Mary’s gold,” and “Herb of the Sun,” among other names. But no matter what you call it, calendula’s legacy is deeply rooted in both modern herbalism and folk traditions. With its bright blossoms, slightly sticky stems, and long blooming season, calendula brings color and purpose to gardens and in the kitchen from early spring to the first frost — a true ally for both body and soul.  Calendula has a rich history that glows as bright as its petals. Ancient Egyptians valued calendula for its rejuvenating properties, using it in skin treatments and religious ceremonies. In Greek and Roman times, it adorned crowns, altars, and feasts, often associated with sun deities and festivals. Medieval European herbalists turned to calendula for everything from healing wounds to protecting against the plague. Its presence in church gardens and apothecaries was so widespread that it became known as the “herb of the sun,” believed to chase away darkness — both literal and metaphorical.  Calendula is a beloved edible flower of the kitchen. Chefs add its petals to soups, stews, and salads — hence the nickname “pot marigold” — for both color and a subtle peppery flavor. In times when saffron was far too expensive, calendula stood in as a worthy replacement. Folklore tells of using calendula in love potions, dreaming of one’s true love by placing petals under the pillow, and even divining the weather by watching whether its blossoms opened in the morning. If calendula failed to bloom, rain was on the way — an herbal barometer in bloom. Calendula originally hailed from southern Europe and the Mediterranean, but its adaptability has allowed it to travel far beyond its native region. It now thrives in gardens and meadows across North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. Unlike many delicate flowers, calendula prefers a bit of roughness. It grows best in average soil, full sun, and with minimal watering. In fact, too much pampering can lead to fewer blooms. Like many of the best things in life, calendula blooms brightest when left a little to its wild nature. Thanks to its long flowering season and ability to self-seed, calendula can feel almost eternal in the garden. One well-placed patch will usually return again and again — a perennial in spirit and by definition. Calendula’s healing gifts are abundant. Herbalists across the world have long turned to this plant for skin care, wound healing, and to help reduce inflammation — and modern science is catching up. Remarkably, calendula’s healing reputation spans the globe — from Ayurveda to European folk medicine, echoing a universal recognition of its gentle, effective powers. More than just medicine, calendula officinalis is steeped in symbolism and sacred meaning. In Christian folklore, calendula was associated with the Virgin Mary, often used to decorate altars and referred to as “Mary’s gold.” It became a flower of devotion and purity, appearing in religious paintings and sacred gardens. In Mexico, calendula (or a closely related variety) plays a central role in Día de los Muertos celebrations, believed to guide the spirits of the dead back to their families with its bright color and strong scent. It’s a flower of memory, of grief, and of connection between the worlds. In old European lore, calendula was considered protective — planted near homes to ward off evil, added to love charms to draw affection, and brewed in teas to bring visions or prophetic dreams. It was a flower of both magic and medicine. Calendula may just be one of the easiest and most rewarding herbs to grow at home. Sow seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, or start indoors a few weeks earlier. Calendula loves full sun and will bloom steadily until the first hard frost. Deadheading (removing spent flowers) encourages even more blooms, and its generous nature means you’ll have plenty to share. Even in pots or balcony planters, calendula does well — just make sure it gets at least  hours of sun per day and drains well. Once it’s established, calendula is fairly drought-resistant and requires little care. To harvest, pick the fully opened flowers in the morning once the dew has dried. Dry them in a warm, dark place and store them in airtight containers for use throughout the year. Calendula’s gifts go far beyond beauty and medicine. Here are a few simple ways to bring its sunshine into your daily life: From ancient rituals to modern remedies, calendula continues to shine as a botanical treasure. Its petals hold centuries of wisdom, yet its lessons remain timeless: Healing can be gentle, beauty can be practical, and some of the most powerful medicines bloom quietly beneath our feet. Whether you grow it, sip it, or simply admire it, calendula offers a radiant reminder of nature’s generosity — one sunny flower at a time. Calendula (Calendula officinalis) is often called “pot marigold,” but it is different from the ornamental marigold (Tagetes species) commonly seen in flower beds. Yes! Calendula is gentle and often used to soothe eczema, diaper rash, and irritated or dry skin. Dry the petals, infuse them in a carrier oil like olive or jojoba for – weeks, then strain and store in a dark glass container.;Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Creating a herbarium is a powerful way to connect with nature, document plant diversity, and gain a hands-on understanding of your local ecosystem. Traditionally, herbariums are collections of preserved plant specimens, carefully pressed and labeled to capture a wide array of botanical details. These collections have played an essential role in botany and plant science for centuries, enabling researchers to study plant species, track environmental changes, and preserve information about the natural world. But a herbarium isn’t just for scientists.

For nature enthusiasts, hobbyists, and even students, a personal herbarium is an invitation to learn more about the plants around them, whether it’s in the backyard, a nearby park, or an open field. I was inspired to create my own herbarium when I started diving into herbalism and permaculture. I realized that to truly understand plants, I needed a resource that combined both identification and practical uses in one place—a guidebook that could evolve over time and help me not only recognize plants but also understand how to use them for culinary and medicinal benefits. In this blog, I’ll share how to get started with your own herbarium, bringing together the worlds of botany and practical plant knowledge. For me, creating a herbarium was a way to document and explore the local edible plants, including some plants we would consider weeds! I loved the idea of capturing not only the plant’s physical traits but also noting where I found it, the season, and what other culinary or medicinal uses it might have. This practice deepened my understanding of each species and its role in the environment. Each specimen I gathered would usually include specific details about the plant, such as its: A herbarium can be as simple or as detailed as you like, making it a valuable resource for anyone passionate about the natural world. As I started building my herbarium, I wanted to combine botanical information with practical uses, creating a guide that was both a herbarium and a materia medica. Here’s how these two approaches differ: Combining these elements in my herbarium gave me a more comprehensive view: not only did I learn to identify plants, but I also began to understand their roles in herbalism, permaculture, and even in my kitchen. I’ve always been drawn to understanding the plants around me, but creating a herbarium gave me a way to dive deeper into local ecosystems and the diversity found there. With a herbarium, I felt more empowered to learn and document without needing a formal biology or science background. There are different ways to create a herbarium, each with its own advantages depending on your interests and needs. To start, decide what you want your herbarium to focus on. It could be backyard forageables, medicinal plants, or even seasonal blooms. Having a theme can make your herbarium more cohesive and give you a clear idea of what plants to look for. Included in my herbarium, I list out the following: When collecting plants, be mindful of the environment. Avoid overharvesting and try to gather only from sustainable areas. Note the habitat and other details so you can accurately document your specimen. Start by choosing healthy, fresh specimens. Place each plant between sheets of absorbent paper to prevent moisture from damaging it. Stack these within a plant press or heavy books, checking every few days and replacing the paper to avoid mold. In two to three weeks, your plant will be fully pressed and ready to store. Drying times depend on the plant’s moisture content and thickness. Typically, two to four weeks is sufficient for most plants. Keep the press in a warm, dry space to speed up the process, and avoid microwave techniques if you want to preserve natural colors. Choose vibrant, healthy specimens to help retain color. Use acid-free paper to prevent yellowing and avoid direct sunlight while drying. For long-term storage, a cool, dry place works best, and UV-resistant spray can help preserve colors. Labeling is essential to keeping your herbarium organized. Include details like the plant’s common and botanical names, location, date of collection, and habitat notes. Get creative with your labels—add sketches, use natural ink, or try botanical names for an extra educational touch. Each season brings its own unique plants to discover. In spring, look for early blooms like violets and dandelions. Summer offers herbs like mint and yarrow, while autumn brings plants like goldenrod and sage. Adding seasonal plants not only diversifies your collection but helps you learn the rhythms of nature. Before foraging, research local regulations to ensure you’re gathering plants legally and ethically. Some common, safe-to-forage plants include dandelions, nettles, and clover. Always be mindful of protected species, and remember to harvest sustainably. Creating a personal herbarium is a journey that deepens your connection to nature, allowing you to learn, explore, and document the world around you. Whether for personal enrichment, practical uses, or sharing knowledge with family and friends, a herbarium is a rewarding project that you can continue to build over time. Start your own herbarium today and let it become a cherished resource for you and future generations. ";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Fermented beverages have long been a staple in many cultures, cherished not only for their delightful flavors but also for their health-promoting properties. From tangy kombucha to other exotic ferments, we’ll explore how these drinks have been a part of traditional diets and continue to be enjoyed for both their taste and wellness benefits. In this article, we will cover: Kombucha is a fermented tea beverage that has gained popularity worldwide for its unique taste and purported health benefits. It is made by fermenting tea, usually black or green, with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). This fermentation process gives kombucha its characteristic slightly sour taste and can produce trace amounts of alcohol. “Fermentation is a health regime, a gourmet art, a multicultural adventure, a form of activism and a spiritual path all rolled into one” Microbial cultures are essential to nutrient absorption, intestinal development, prevention of infection, formation of intestinal blood vessels, and water absorption. Fermented foods are a way of encouraging and befriending helpful microbial cultures and making food more digestible nutritious, and most importantly, delicious. Improves Digestion: By introducing beneficial probiotic bacteria that exist symbiotically in our gut and help to break down food in our intestines. Enzyme activity also increases dramatically, further helping break down food, thereby increasing the absorption of nutrients. Our bodies can only use nutrients in food if they are accessible. Fermentation renders food more bioavailable by ‘pre-digesting’ it as well as by providing enzymes and probiotics necessary for digestion. The process of fermentation creates B vitamins including folic acid, niacin, thiamin, and biotin. B vitamins help with our body’s ability to handle stress. It’s important to note that the exact nutritional profile can vary depending on the specific tea used, the duration of fermentation, and any additional flavorings. Here’s a general table that outlines the nutritional facts of kombucha. It’s crucial to read the labels of commercial kombucha for specific nutritional information, as ingredients and fermentation processes can cause significant variations. Fermenting beverages at home is easy, but a little science on basic beverage fermentation helps us get a handle on the seemingly mysterious world of bacteria and yeasts that are transforming your sweet liquids into fizzy, tangy, healthier beverages. Water + sugar + micro-organisms + warm(ish) temperatures =reduced sugar, alcohol production, carbon dioxide, organic acids, increased enzyme activity, beneficial bacteria, and increased B vitamins! The factors of time, temperature, and type of organism introduced for fermentation contribute to how much of each product of fermentation you get! Fermentation = the transformative action of micro-organisms! ✓ Food Preservation: Fermented foods contain lactic acid, acetic acid, and alcohol to retain nutrients and prevent spoilage. ✓ Removes toxins from food: i.e. beneficial bacteria and organic acids can overpower e-coli., and can remove or reduce nitrates, prussic acid, oxalic acid, nitrosamines, and glucosides. Fermentation is the work of a community of microorganisms. Lactic acid fermentation is the process of conversion from sugars to organic acids. In making brined pickles, kimchi, and sauerkraut; brine (salty water) serves as protection against the growth of purifying bacteria. Initially, this is what enables the beneficial bacteria (in this case- lactobacillus) to thrive. These bacteria consume the sugar of the vegetables or fruits and act to decrease the pH, thus acidifying and therefore preserving the food. Lactobacillus is also present in wine, some beers, yogurt, most cheeses, and sourdough starter. People have been preparing fermented foods in their homes throughout history. Without refrigeration or pressure canners, people have produced delicious, nutritious, and safely preserved food. The system of food production is very far removed from these roots. Since the discovery of ‘germs’ and subsequently, the invention of pasteurization, we have been taught that all germs or bacteria are bad and can cause sickness. We have been waging a war on germs ever since. Initially, the anti-bacterial warfare helped stop the spread of disease in unsanitary conditions. Ultimately though, the overuse of antibiotics and antibiotic products such as soap and household cleaners has bred a kind of super-bug- resistant to antibiotics. Ecoimmunonutrition Definition: The concept that an organism’s immune function occurs in the context of an ecology, an ecosystem of different microbial cultures, that is possible to build and develop in oneself through diet. Most of us begin our inoculation at birth. As we pass through our mothers’ birth canal we are absorbing helpful lactobacilli, and as we drank her milk we received bifobacteria, both of which became an integral part of our immune and digestive systems. To try to rid the world and ourselves of bacteria is insane and impossible and deeply detrimental. Immunologists lament our current relationship with bacteria pointing to “cruel tests that have been done on mice and rabbits where the scientists isolate them and do not allow them to be exposed to bacteria and they develop I.B.S., Crohns, ulceritis, and allergies.” (Callahan). Traditionally Fermented Foods such as unheated, fermented, pickled cabbage (sauerkraut and kimchi) and other pickled vegetables are humble, healthy foods that have undergone a transformation by micro-organisms to preserve the food and enhance and change flavours. Nearly every culture around the world has a tradition of fermenting food- and nearly every food has at some point in history been prepared by using fermentation. The process of fermentation takes time. Because of our ‘time is money’ culture, these traditionally prepared foods are being replaced by imitations- quickly made with vinegar and heat-processing and often preservatives, to quickly and cheaply make a shelf-stable product. These processes remove any health benefits that the naturally fermented pickles have! This table aims to clarify common misunderstandings and provide a clearer, more accurate picture of what kombucha is and its effects. Your choice of tea: I recommend only using organic tea. Both tea bags and loose-leaf teas work. You can also add herbal teas in addition to the caffeinated tea*. It is a myth that kombucha requires caffeine*! Other herbal teas that have tannins and nitrogen also work. Kombucha is traditionally brewed using tea leaves, however you can make successful batches using hibiscus flowers, red raspberry leaves, nettles and yerba mate instead. How much sugar is in kombucha? The initial sugar in an oz (ml) glass of the sweetened tea, unfermented is g. After  days of fermentation at average room temperature, this reduces to g (a little less than orange juice). After  days of fermentation, this reduces to .g (about the same as carrot juice). Factors such as the type of sugar used, and the temperature in fermentation vary the resulting sugar content. The type of sugar: The fermentation process by the SCOBY (kombucha culture) consumes the sugar, (so you don’t have to!), so ‘feeding’ it a pure form of sugar makes for a healthier culture, making healthier and tastier kombucha! Refined cane sugar (not GMO beet sugar!) works well. I choose fair-trade and organic refined sugar. When assessing the quality of kombucha, there are several key factors to consider: Remember, personal preference plays a role, and you might need to try a few brands or varieties to find the one that suits your taste best. Reconnecting with our roots and more people taking an eco-friendly approach to eating, kombucha is making a resurgence. A lot of people are creating business centered around kombucha. Kombucha and other fermentations hold a significant place in the realm of sustainable living. Kombucha was the first ferment I tried at home. It felt like the “safest” entry point to start my fermentation journey. Not only have I had a lot of fun learning the process, but it has given me a lot more confidence in practicing fermentation. My kids love kombucha as well and it offers them a really great alternative to sugary soft drinks or other beverages loaded with sugar. This brewing practice aligns with the zero-waste movement, as it utilizes reusable containers and can even incorporate leftover fruits or herbs for flavoring, thus minimizing food waste. Consequently, kombucha not only offers a sustainable alternative to commercial beverages but also fosters a deeper connection between consumers and their consumption habits, encouraging mindfulness and responsibility towards personal health and environmental impact. By reclaiming the skill of making our fermented beverages we are The story of kombucha is a fascinating journey from ancient brew to a modern health trend, reflecting changing tastes, cultural exchanges, and the growing global interest in health and wellness. Fermenting beverages can be done at home, using the equipment that you have around the house, salvaged from back alleys and restaurants, or purchased at minimal expense.  Liters water (filtered)

Funnel
Bottles or jars with closeable lids By bottling your kombucha and leaving it on the counter for a few days, you will have a fizzier brew. Some people like to ‘age’ their kombucha by leaving it in the bottle for longer periods of time. As wine does, kombucha continues to ferment in the bottle. When your kombucha is to your liking, you can put it in the fridge. To do this, strain out the liquid (remember to reserve some kombucha and the SCOBY(s) to start the next batch!) into a clean, close-able container. I like the swing-cap beer bottles. Or use wine bottles with screw-cap lids. Using a funnel is helpful here.  Guidelines to keep your home ferments food-safe By following a few common-sense methods of cleanliness and by trusting your senses, fermenting food at home is safe and easy. People have differing standards for cleanliness. (Have you ever watched someone else wash the dishes?) Therefore, some people like to use chemicals to disinfect their fermentation vessels. I would personally rather deal with some germs and dirt than I would with most of those chemicals. If you are not concerned with the ‘fizz’ factor, or do not like very fizzy drinks, just remove the SCOBY and some liquid to store it in, loosely cover the container and enjoy at room temperature or from the fridge. Below is a SCOBY Health Chart that describes the appearance of a healthy SCOBY versus one that might be problematic, along with corresponding action steps. This chart can guide kombucha brewers, especially beginners, in identifying and addressing potential issues with their SCOBY. Regular observation of your SCOBY and the kombucha it produces is crucial for successful brewing. Any significant changes in appearance or smell should be noted, as they can indicate the health of your brew. to make the fizziest, tastiest brew, you can add some fruit juice, fruit or herbal cordials or vegetable juice to the bottle and add the kombucha to that. This added sugar will cause a secondary fermentation and more fizz. Let the closed bottle sit at room temp for a few days to develop more carbonation. Put it in the fridge once it’s carbonated to your liking. Adding about oz (/ cup) fruit juice to -quart (liter) bottle of kombucha is a good starting point. Different juices have different amounts of sugar, so be aware that carbonation will happen faster or more vigorously for some juices than others. For pineapple juice, add (oz ¼ cup) per  liter (quart) bottle You can also try adding syrup or herbal cordials. Start with  Tbsp/liter bottle. Adding whole berries or chunks of fruit is another method of infusing flavour. Serve it chunky like sangria or strained. Below is a table showcasing popular flavor add-ins for kombucha, categorized into fruits, herbs, and spices. This table can be a helpful guide for those looking to experiment with different kombucha flavors. Feel free to mix and match these add-ins to create unique kombucha flavors. It’s important to add these flavorings during the second fermentation process for the best infusion of flavors. When your SCOBY (aka ‘Mother’) is not actively fermenting a batch of kombucha, just store it in some liquid from the previous batch in a jar, loosely covered and at room temperature. It’s a good idea to have a backup in the fridge in case something happens. The only way that I know is to test it out. Put the culture into a new batch and see if it ferments. You can add more than one SCOBY to a jar, and it ferments about the same rate as if you only add one. If you do add more than one SCOBY, they may grow together to form a super-SCOBY! There is debate about whether kombucha produces probiotic bacteria. Now that larger studies are in effect on Kombucha due to its explosion in popularity, analysis of kombucha is showing (unsurprisingly) varied results. While lactobacilli are classified as probiotic bacteria, and some kombucha cultures do contain these bacteria, others do not. (Keeping in mind that only certain studied strains of micro-organisms are currently classified as probiotic. There are micro-organisms being continually discovered and found to benefit our health.) SCOBY stands for Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast. The “mother culture” acts on the nitrogen and tannins in tea and the carbohydrates in sugar. This produces acetic, gluconic and butyric acids as well as lactic acid (from probiotic bacteria lactobacilli). These acids are powerful aids in the body’s cleansing process. In addition to these organic acids, kombucha creates B vitamins during fermentation. It is consumed as a natural energy booster, digestive aid, and liver-cleansing beverage. The events unfolding in your crock have been viewed by many cultures as magical or miraculous. Taste and tend the contents frequently. They will teach you about the process of fermentation. People have been preparing fermented foods in their homes throughout history. Without refrigeration or pressure canners, people have produced delicious, nutritious, and safely preserved food. Low in Calories: If consumed in its basic form (without added sugars or flavors), kombucha is relatively low in calories. This makes it a better choice than high-calorie beverages for those trying to lose weight.
Appetite Control: Some people report that drinking kombucha helps control their appetite, possibly due to its acetic acid content, similar to apple cider vinegar. However, this effect isn’t universally experienced.
Sugar Content: Be cautious of commercial kombucha drinks as they can contain added sugars, which might negate any potential weight loss benefits. Always check the label for sugar content.
Physical Activity and Diet: No single food or drink, including kombucha, can independently cause significant weight loss. It should be accompanied by a balanced diet and regular physical activity. There is no scientific consensus on how much kombucha you should drink per day. If you are just starting to drink kombucha work your way up by starting with a / cup of kombucha per day until you reach  cup. I usually mix mine with some carbonated water to make it extra fun and bubbly!";Jardin Feuilles de Vie

"In the realm of wild herbs, yarrow (Achillea millefolium) stands out for its myriad of health benefits and historical significance in herbal medicine. This resilient and easy-to-identify plant, with its distinctive feathery foliage and clusters of tiny, white to pink flowers, has been revered through the ages for its medicinal properties. As we explore the benefits and uses of yarrow, it becomes evident why this plant deserves a place in both our gardens and our natural health toolkit. In this article we are going to cover: Yarrow grows nearly worldwide in temperate locations. It isn’t a picky herb and will grow almost anywhere including coastal and mountainous regions. It is common to find them in meadows, fields, backyards, and disturbed areas. Foraging for yarrow is a rewarding endeavor, offering an opportunity to connect with nature and discover the plant’s potent properties firsthand. When foraging for yarrow, consider the following: Yarrow is a wooly perennial plant with feather-like leaves. It has a tall flower stalk (- feet) that ends in a cluster of small, daisy-like flowers. The flowers of wild yarrow are white or pink. Cultivated varieties can be yellow, orange, or red. One of the defining characteristics of yarrow is the distinctive filly leaves, which helps to distinguish it from look-alikes. Yarrow has a scent that is reminiscent of fresh pine needles. It also has a grooved stem with wooly hairs. Yarrow is most often confused with Queen Anne’s lace (Daucus carota), which is not toxic. Queen Anne’s lace has a true umbel-shaped flower, often with a dark-colored dot in the middle, a hairy stem, and smells of carrots. Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum) may look somewhat similar to yarrow when it is young, but grow to become much larger. It has purple-spotted stems. Yarrow is more than just a pretty face; it boasts a plethora of health benefits that have been utilized in traditional medicine for centuries: While yarrow is best known for its medicinal applications, it also has a place in the kitchen. Its bitter and aromatic qualities make it a unique herb for culinary experimentation: While yarrow is generally safe for most people, it’s important to note that it can cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the Asteraceae family, which includes ragweed, chrysanthemums, and daisies. Pregnant and nursing women should avoid consuming yarrow, as its effects during pregnancy and lactation are not well studied. Yarrow is best used fresh whenever possible. It can be dried for later use. Hang flower stalks in upside-down bundles to dry or spread leaves and flowers out in a basket or drying screen. In milder climates, the leaves can be harvested year-round. Yarrow’s multifaceted benefits highlight the plant’s significance in both traditional and modern herbal practices. Whether you’re drawn to its healing properties, culinary potential, or simply its wild beauty, yarrow offers a profound connection to the healing power of nature. As you explore the uses of this remarkable herb, let it inspire a deeper appreciation for the plants that share our world and the ancient wisdom they hold.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
We have been growing thyme in our gardens and kitchens for thousands of years. This humble herb might not grab attention like flashy basil or towering rosemary, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in staying power. Walk through any herb garden, and you’ll likely find thyme tucked somewhere, often spilling over the edges of paths, releasing its distinctive scent when stepped on. Thyme belongs to the mint family, with common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) being the variety most often found in gardens and kitchens. Its name comes from the Greek word “thymos,” which means courage or strength – fitting for a plant that survives in some pretty harsh conditions. With tiny, oval leaves growing on woody stems and small purple, pink, or white flowers, thyme might look delicate, but don’t be fooled – this herb is tough as nails. The fragrance of thyme is unique – woody, slightly floral, with hints of lemon, pepper, and something distinctly earthy. Crush a leaf between your fingers, and you’ll understand why this herb has captivated cooks and healers for centuries. Thyme’s relationship with humans stretches back to ancient Egypt, where it was used in embalming rituals. The Egyptians believed its aromatic properties would help the spirit on its journey to the afterlife. No pressure, little herb. The ancient Greeks burned thyme as incense in their temples, believing its smoke purified the space. Greek soldiers bathed in thyme-infused water before battle, supposedly to infuse themselves with courage and vigor. This association with bravery continued with the Romans, who offered thyme to those going into battle. In medieval Europe, thyme took on new significance. Ladies embroidered thyme sprigs on scarves for their knights heading to the Crusades as symbols of courage. Thyme also gained a reputation for warding off nightmares when placed under pillows – a practice that persisted for centuries. One particularly interesting chapter in thyme’s history involves the Black Death. During this devastating plague, people would carry posies containing thyme and other strong-smelling herbs, believing they provided protection against the disease. Modern science has since shown that thyme does indeed have powerful antiseptic properties – those medieval folks were onto something. The th-century English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper wrote that thyme was “a noble strengthener of the lungs” – another traditional use that modern research has partly validated, as thyme can help with respiratory conditions. Thyme is native to the Mediterranean region, which explains why it loves the sun and hates soggy soil. Take a hike through the hills of Greece or southern France and you’ll spot thyme tucked between rocks, growing happily in places that would kill most garden plants. Today, thyme grows throughout Europe, North Africa, Asia, and North America, having been spread by centuries of human cultivation. It’s adapted to a surprising range of climates, though it generally prefers hot, sunny positions and well-drained soil. In gardens, thyme often finds a home in rock gardens, between paving stones, or as a low-growing ground cover. Some varieties even substitute for lawn grass in low-traffic areas, creating a fragrant carpet that releases its scent when walked upon. The plant’s natural habitat explains its growing preferences: thyme absolutely hates wet feet. Plant it in waterlogged soil, and it will quickly rot. But give it some sandy or gravelly soil and plenty of sun, and it will reward you with years of growth from a single planting. People have been using thyme to treat various ailments for centuries, long before anyone understood why it worked. Modern research has finally caught up with what our ancestors somehow figured out through trial and error. The secret behind thyme’s medicinal power is its essential oil, especially a compound called thymol. Here’s what traditional healers used thyme for: I’ve tried making thyme steam for stuffy sinuses (just put fresh thyme in a bowl of hot water and breathe in the steam), and while I can’t prove anything scientifically, it definitely made breathing easier! Being an ancient and widespread herb, thyme has gathered its share of curious beliefs and superstitions. In European folklore, thyme was thought to attract fairies to gardens. Some claimed that patches of wild thyme marked places where fairies danced under the full moon. This association led to the planting of thyme in gardens not just for practical purposes but as an invitation to beneficial fairy folk. Scottish highlanders brewed a tea of wild thyme to provide “second sight” or prophetic visions – a practice that probably had more to do with thyme’s mild mood-altering properties than actual clairvoyance. In some parts of England, it was believed that a patch of wild thyme growing on a hillside indicated buried treasure beneath – perhaps because the plant often grows on rocky, mineral-rich soil that might contain ore deposits. Many cultures associated thyme with transitions and passages. In addition to its role in Egyptian funerary practices, some European traditions included placing sprigs of thyme in coffins to assure a safe passage to the afterlife. More happily, thyme was also incorporated into wedding bouquets and decorations to ensure courage and strength in the marriage. Thyme ranks among the easiest herbs to grow, making it perfect for beginning gardeners. It asks little and gives much in return. Starting thyme from seed requires patience, as germination can be slow and somewhat unpredictable. Most gardeners start with small plants purchased from nurseries or cuttings from established plants, which root readily in moist soil. The key to growing thyme successfully lies in mimicking its natural Mediterranean habitat: full sun, excellent drainage, and not too much fertilizer or water. In fact, thyme develops more intense flavor when grown in somewhat poor soil and allowed to dry out between waterings. In colder regions, thyme may die back in winter but usually recovers in spring. After several years, plants often become woody and less productive, at which point it’s best to replace them with fresh ones. Harvest thyme just before it flowers for the most concentrated flavor. Morning harvesting, after the dew has dried but before the day heats up, captures the highest concentration of essential oils. While we now know thyme primarily as a culinary herb, its uses extend far beyond the kitchen: From ancient Egyptian tombs to modern kitchen gardens, thyme has proven itself one of our most enduring herbal companions. Its stubborn ability to thrive in tough conditions mirrors the resilience it brings to those who use it – whether as food, medicine, or simple garden beauty. Something about thyme’s subtle, complex fragrance continues to draw us back, generation after generation. Perhaps it’s the way it connects us to our ancestors, who gathered wild thyme from Mediterranean hillsides and discovered its remarkable properties through centuries of use. Small as it is, thyme reminds us that sometimes the most unassuming plants carry the most profound gifts. The next time you brush past it in a garden or sprinkle it into a soup, remember you’re participating in a human tradition spanning thousands of years and countless cultures – all centered around a tiny herb with outsized importance.;Jardin Feuilles de Vie
Stroll through any garden, and you might be lucky to spot calendula officinalis — with its vibrant orange and yellow petals radiating just like miniature suns. Often mistaken for the common marigold, this bright flower has been cherished for centuries for its powerful healing properties, culinary charm, and symbolic significance across cultures. Scientifically known as Calendula officinalis, this member of the daisy family has been called “pot marigold,” “Mary’s gold,” and “Herb of the Sun,” among other names. But no matter what you call it, calendula’s legacy is deeply rooted in both modern herbalism and folk traditions. With its bright blossoms, slightly sticky stems, and long blooming season, calendula brings color and purpose to gardens and in the kitchen from early spring to the first frost — a true ally for both body and soul.  Calendula has a rich history that glows as bright as its petals. Ancient Egyptians valued calendula for its rejuvenating properties, using it in skin treatments and religious ceremonies. In Greek and Roman times, it adorned crowns, altars, and feasts, often associated with sun deities and festivals. Medieval European herbalists turned to calendula for everything from healing wounds to protecting against the plague. Its presence in church gardens and apothecaries was so widespread that it became known as the “herb of the sun,” believed to chase away darkness — both literal and metaphorical.  Calendula is a beloved edible flower of the kitchen. Chefs add its petals to soups, stews, and salads — hence the nickname “pot marigold” — for both color and a subtle peppery flavor. In times when saffron was far too expensive, calendula stood in as a worthy replacement. Folklore tells of using calendula in love potions, dreaming of one’s true love by placing petals under the pillow, and even divining the weather by watching whether its blossoms opened in the morning. If calendula failed to bloom, rain was on the way — an herbal barometer in bloom. Calendula originally hailed from southern Europe and the Mediterranean, but its adaptability has allowed it to travel far beyond its native region. It now thrives in gardens and meadows across North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. Unlike many delicate flowers, calendula prefers a bit of roughness. It grows best in average soil, full sun, and with minimal watering. In fact, too much pampering can lead to fewer blooms. Like many of the best things in life, calendula blooms brightest when left a little to its wild nature. Thanks to its long flowering season and ability to self-seed, calendula can feel almost eternal in the garden. One well-placed patch will usually return again and again — a perennial in spirit and by definition. Calendula’s healing gifts are abundant. Herbalists across the world have long turned to this plant for skin care, wound healing, and to help reduce inflammation — and modern science is catching up. Remarkably, calendula’s healing reputation spans the globe — from Ayurveda to European folk medicine, echoing a universal recognition of its gentle, effective powers. More than just medicine, calendula officinalis is steeped in symbolism and sacred meaning. In Christian folklore, calendula was associated with the Virgin Mary, often used to decorate altars and referred to as “Mary’s gold.” It became a flower of devotion and purity, appearing in religious paintings and sacred gardens. In Mexico, calendula (or a closely related variety) plays a central role in Día de los Muertos celebrations, believed to guide the spirits of the dead back to their families with its bright color and strong scent. It’s a flower of memory, of grief, and of connection between the worlds. In old European lore, calendula was considered protective — planted near homes to ward off evil, added to love charms to draw affection, and brewed in teas to bring visions or prophetic dreams. It was a flower of both magic and medicine. Calendula may just be one of the easiest and most rewarding herbs to grow at home. Sow seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, or start indoors a few weeks earlier. Calendula loves full sun and will bloom steadily until the first hard frost. Deadheading (removing spent flowers) encourages even more blooms, and its generous nature means you’ll have plenty to share. Even in pots or balcony planters, calendula does well — just make sure it gets at least  hours of sun per day and drains well. Once it’s established, calendula is fairly drought-resistant and requires little care. To harvest, pick the fully opened flowers in the morning once the dew has dried. Dry them in a warm, dark place and store them in airtight containers for use throughout the year. Calendula’s gifts go far beyond beauty and medicine. Here are a few simple ways to bring its sunshine into your daily life: From ancient rituals to modern remedies, calendula continues to shine as a botanical treasure. Its petals hold centuries of wisdom, yet its lessons remain timeless: Healing can be gentle, beauty can be practical, and some of the most powerful medicines bloom quietly beneath our feet. Whether you grow it, sip it, or simply admire it, calendula offers a radiant reminder of nature’s generosity — one sunny flower at a time. Calendula (Calendula officinalis) is often called “pot marigold,” but it is different from the ornamental marigold (Tagetes species) commonly seen in flower beds. Yes! Calendula is gentle and often used to soothe eczema, diaper rash, and irritated or dry skin. Dry the petals, infuse them in a carrier oil like olive or jojoba for – weeks, then strain and store in a dark glass container.;Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Creating a herbarium is a powerful way to connect with nature, document plant diversity, and gain a hands-on understanding of your local ecosystem. Traditionally, herbariums are collections of preserved plant specimens, carefully pressed and labeled to capture a wide array of botanical details. These collections have played an essential role in botany and plant science for centuries, enabling researchers to study plant species, track environmental changes, and preserve information about the natural world. But a herbarium isn’t just for scientists.

For nature enthusiasts, hobbyists, and even students, a personal herbarium is an invitation to learn more about the plants around them, whether it’s in the backyard, a nearby park, or an open field. I was inspired to create my own herbarium when I started diving into herbalism and permaculture. I realized that to truly understand plants, I needed a resource that combined both identification and practical uses in one place—a guidebook that could evolve over time and help me not only recognize plants but also understand how to use them for culinary and medicinal benefits. In this blog, I’ll share how to get started with your own herbarium, bringing together the worlds of botany and practical plant knowledge. For me, creating a herbarium was a way to document and explore the local edible plants, including some plants we would consider weeds! I loved the idea of capturing not only the plant’s physical traits but also noting where I found it, the season, and what other culinary or medicinal uses it might have. This practice deepened my understanding of each species and its role in the environment. Each specimen I gathered would usually include specific details about the plant, such as its: A herbarium can be as simple or as detailed as you like, making it a valuable resource for anyone passionate about the natural world. As I started building my herbarium, I wanted to combine botanical information with practical uses, creating a guide that was both a herbarium and a materia medica. Here’s how these two approaches differ: Combining these elements in my herbarium gave me a more comprehensive view: not only did I learn to identify plants, but I also began to understand their roles in herbalism, permaculture, and even in my kitchen. I’ve always been drawn to understanding the plants around me, but creating a herbarium gave me a way to dive deeper into local ecosystems and the diversity found there. With a herbarium, I felt more empowered to learn and document without needing a formal biology or science background. There are different ways to create a herbarium, each with its own advantages depending on your interests and needs. To start, decide what you want your herbarium to focus on. It could be backyard forageables, medicinal plants, or even seasonal blooms. Having a theme can make your herbarium more cohesive and give you a clear idea of what plants to look for. Included in my herbarium, I list out the following: When collecting plants, be mindful of the environment. Avoid overharvesting and try to gather only from sustainable areas. Note the habitat and other details so you can accurately document your specimen. Start by choosing healthy, fresh specimens. Place each plant between sheets of absorbent paper to prevent moisture from damaging it. Stack these within a plant press or heavy books, checking every few days and replacing the paper to avoid mold. In two to three weeks, your plant will be fully pressed and ready to store. Drying times depend on the plant’s moisture content and thickness. Typically, two to four weeks is sufficient for most plants. Keep the press in a warm, dry space to speed up the process, and avoid microwave techniques if you want to preserve natural colors. Choose vibrant, healthy specimens to help retain color. Use acid-free paper to prevent yellowing and avoid direct sunlight while drying. For long-term storage, a cool, dry place works best, and UV-resistant spray can help preserve colors. Labeling is essential to keeping your herbarium organized. Include details like the plant’s common and botanical names, location, date of collection, and habitat notes. Get creative with your labels—add sketches, use natural ink, or try botanical names for an extra educational touch. Each season brings its own unique plants to discover. In spring, look for early blooms like violets and dandelions. Summer offers herbs like mint and yarrow, while autumn brings plants like goldenrod and sage. Adding seasonal plants not only diversifies your collection but helps you learn the rhythms of nature. Before foraging, research local regulations to ensure you’re gathering plants legally and ethically. Some common, safe-to-forage plants include dandelions, nettles, and clover. Always be mindful of protected species, and remember to harvest sustainably. Creating a personal herbarium is a journey that deepens your connection to nature, allowing you to learn, explore, and document the world around you. Whether for personal enrichment, practical uses, or sharing knowledge with family and friends, a herbarium is a rewarding project that you can continue to build over time. Start your own herbarium today and let it become a cherished resource for you and future generations. ";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"In the realm of wild herbs, yarrow (Achillea millefolium) stands out for its myriad of health benefits and historical significance in herbal medicine. This resilient and easy-to-identify plant, with its distinctive feathery foliage and clusters of tiny, white to pink flowers, has been revered through the ages for its medicinal properties. As we explore the benefits and uses of yarrow, it becomes evident why this plant deserves a place in both our gardens and our natural health toolkit. In this article we are going to cover: Yarrow grows nearly worldwide in temperate locations. It isn’t a picky herb and will grow almost anywhere including coastal and mountainous regions. It is common to find them in meadows, fields, backyards, and disturbed areas. Foraging for yarrow is a rewarding endeavor, offering an opportunity to connect with nature and discover the plant’s potent properties firsthand. When foraging for yarrow, consider the following: Yarrow is a wooly perennial plant with feather-like leaves. It has a tall flower stalk (- feet) that ends in a cluster of small, daisy-like flowers. The flowers of wild yarrow are white or pink. Cultivated varieties can be yellow, orange, or red. One of the defining characteristics of yarrow is the distinctive filly leaves, which helps to distinguish it from look-alikes. Yarrow has a scent that is reminiscent of fresh pine needles. It also has a grooved stem with wooly hairs. Yarrow is most often confused with Queen Anne’s lace (Daucus carota), which is not toxic. Queen Anne’s lace has a true umbel-shaped flower, often with a dark-colored dot in the middle, a hairy stem, and smells of carrots. Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum) may look somewhat similar to yarrow when it is young, but grow to become much larger. It has purple-spotted stems. Yarrow is more than just a pretty face; it boasts a plethora of health benefits that have been utilized in traditional medicine for centuries: While yarrow is best known for its medicinal applications, it also has a place in the kitchen. Its bitter and aromatic qualities make it a unique herb for culinary experimentation: While yarrow is generally safe for most people, it’s important to note that it can cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the Asteraceae family, which includes ragweed, chrysanthemums, and daisies. Pregnant and nursing women should avoid consuming yarrow, as its effects during pregnancy and lactation are not well studied. Yarrow is best used fresh whenever possible. It can be dried for later use. Hang flower stalks in upside-down bundles to dry or spread leaves and flowers out in a basket or drying screen. In milder climates, the leaves can be harvested year-round. Yarrow’s multifaceted benefits highlight the plant’s significance in both traditional and modern herbal practices. Whether you’re drawn to its healing properties, culinary potential, or simply its wild beauty, yarrow offers a profound connection to the healing power of nature. As you explore the uses of this remarkable herb, let it inspire a deeper appreciation for the plants that share our world and the ancient wisdom they hold.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"It feels strange to say it out loud: we moved. We left our little  m² permaculture garden. We left Switzerland. And we started over, again. If you’ve been following us for a while, you’ve probably noticed the silence. No new updates from the garden. No fresh videos showing our seasonal shifts. And that’s because, behind the scenes, our lives were changing completely. On December st, , we found our forever home in France. After months of searching and months more of battling bank paperwork as independents, we bought a house in the middle of the forest, in a quiet corner of Les Vosges, France. The property is over , m², nearly . hectares, with , m² of forest alone. It’s more than we ever dreamed. And somehow, exactly what we were looking for. Back in Switzerland, we had carved out a beautiful life. A lake nearby. A compact but thriving permaculture garden. A community that had grown around it. But something inside both of us kept whispering: Let’s go deeper! What if we had space to not just garden, but to regenerate? Not just to grow food, but to steward land, plant forests, raise animals, and build something that would last beyond us? We were craving silence. Space. Wildness. Freedom. And then we found this place (video below has English subtitles!). When we first stepped onto the property, we knew it was different. It wasn’t just the land, it was the feeling. A resounding feeling in all of us that this is where we are meant to be. There’s a greenhouse already in place, tucked against a small hill. Rocky terrain laced with iron. Clay and sand, and a natural water source. A pond that isn’t technically ours, yet, but one that holds stories older than just this property. And a house. Solid and beautiful, built in the s by people who cared. The owner even built the stone walls around the garden himself. It felt lived-in. Held. Loved. That mattered to us. We’ve only scratched the surface of this land. It holds secrets in its soil and in its stones. Ancient ones. The trees here are different. The soil is different. The air is damp, lush, and alive. We’re at nearly the same elevation as before (m), but the climate couldn’t be more different. Here the plants speak a different language. We’re learning. Slowly. Many of the trees we don’t yet know by name. Some feel familiar, hazelnuts, crabapple, oak, blackberries, and pines. Others are still strangers. If you spot anything familiar in our photos or videos, please let us know in the comments. One of the most surprising joys of this shift has been to see the abundance of life. Not just the plants, but the animals. Since arriving, we’ve seen wild boars, foxes, deer, and even a nutria by the pond. We’ve watched crayfish scuttle across the road and in the stream next to the house. Lizards warming themselves on sun-soaked stones. And insects, so many insects!! Bees, beetles, wasps, dragonflies, and the occasional tick (of course). We’ve also met our neighbors: cows. Dozens of them. Calm, quiet, curious. They graze just over the fence and seem content to share the silence (these ones don’t have bells like in Switzerland!). We’re not starting from scratch, exactly. But we are starting fresh. The greenhouse will soon be full of sprouts. The rocky ground will need compost, mulch, cover crops, and layers of care. The forest will evolve into something between wild woodland and an edible paradise. I dream of a food forest full of hazelnuts, berries, medicinal plants, and trees for firewood. And yes, we’ve already built a composting system and garden bed! (If you’re curious how we built this system, check out our DIY Pallet Compost Guide for the full how-to.) There’s also a small wooden outbuilding waiting to become a home for rabbits, chickens, ducks, and maybe, eventually, a few sheep. These aren’t just for food or company. In permaculture, every animal has a role to play: managing pests, fertilizing soil, trimming grass, or teaching us patience. This place doesn’t just hold potential. It holds history. We’ve found old dry-stone walls, giant carved stones that feel like something from a Celtic storybook. And according to local lore, monks lived in these woods over a thousand years ago. They practiced a form of large-scale permaculture before the word existed, cycling fish through ponds, using nutrient-rich water to grow food, and shaping the land with intention. There’s something deeply humbling about walking in their footsteps. About touching the same stones. About continuing the work, even if it’s under a different name now. Even though we’ve moved, we haven’t let go of everything. We’re keeping the Swiss garden alive, at least for now. Partly because it’s a beautiful place. But also because it allows us to compare, reflect, and learn. Two different climates. Two different soils. Two parallel experiments in regeneration. We’ll be watching how seeds grow here versus there. How medicinal herbs adapt. How fruit trees thrive. There’s something poetic about growing the same plant in two places and seeing how it expresses itself. This isn’t a holiday home. It’s not a side project. We moved. Fully. We left Switzerland. The old apartment where Sean grew up is gone. Our routines, our assumptions, even our habits are shifting in a massive way. This is our new base. Our family home. The place where we’ll raise our three son’s, host friends, plant trees, and slowly shape a life aligned with the values we’ve been cultivating for years: simplicity, regeneration, seasonal living, and community. More videos. More stories. More learning. We’ll be sharing the big changes, like when we build the food forest or install the animal systems. But we’ll also share the small ones, like when we transplant wild raspberries, or we spot a deer at dusk, or the misty land in the morning cold. If there’s anything you’re curious about, just ask. If you know a plant we don’t, tell us. If you’ve made a similar move, we’d love to hear your story. Thank you for being here. Truly. This move was years in the making. It took courage, risk, and a lot of trust. But now that we’re here, with the soil beneath our feet and the stars above us, we know we made the right choice. We’re not just gardening anymore.
We’re tending a way of life. — And most of all, tell us what you’d love to see next. We’re listening.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Learning how to build a pallet compost system is easy and, in my opinion, one of the best ways to keep garden and food scraps out of the landfill. When we arrived on this land, compost was already happening, but in scattered, makeshift piles. Kitchen scraps and fireplace ash had been tossed beneath the trees. Yard trimmings were heaped under an old ash tree on the far side of the property. It worked, sort of. But as we began shaping our permaculture garden, the need for something more intentional became clear. We wanted a system that was easier to access, closer to the house, and better suited to supporting a healthy compost cycle. So, on a misty summer morning, we rolled up our sleeves and built a proper compost zone, with nothing more than pallets, screws, and a little muscle! 🎥 The full behind-the-scenes video is below if you want to follow our real-time journey: In permaculture, compost is more than waste management, it’s a living fertilizer. Homemade compost: Whether you’re gardening on a balcony or tending a food forest, compost is your foundation. Learn more about our approach to permaculture here. We followed a simple -bin method: one section for raw materials, one for active composting, and one for finished compost. Here’s how to build yours. Tip: Look for pallets stamped HT (heat-treated), not MB (methyl bromide), to avoid chemicals in your compost. Select a spot that’s: We placed ours next to the animal area and hose to keep everything connected, one of the core principles of zone planning in permaculture. Before building, we had to move a large decorative stone out of the way. Pro tip: tipping is easier than dragging! The first bin uses three pallets, one back and two sides; the other two use just two pallets.
Set up: We mistakenly added active compost to the first bin, but don’t worry, bins can be flipped later! Composting is forgiving. Use wood screws to stabilize the structure. If you want the bins to be movable, use zip ties or rope for a temporary option. We used: Don’t forget to mix green and brown layers! 🌿🍂 Compost needs ~% humidity to break down properly. Too dry = it won’t decompose. Too wet = it turns anaerobic and smelly. Use your hand: if it feels like a wrung-out sponge, it’s perfect. You can also buy compost thermometers with humidity sensors. Here’s an example (external link). Turn the pile every – weeks. Add moisture or browns as needed. And celebrate the appearance of worms, beetles, and fungi—they’re your best helpers. No garden? No problem. You can: See how we composted in a small apartment in this story. We were proud of our new setup, even if we got one step backwards in our bin layout. Thankfully, compost is patient. In a few days, we’ll rotate the materials and get back on track. And honestly? The compost doesn’t care if it rains or if we mess up once. It just keeps doing its thing, turning scraps into soil, waste into life. Have you tried building a compost bin? What materials did you use?

"Natural cleaning products are advertised everywhere, but are they worth it? Before I ever lived in the countryside or studied permaculture, I worked as a house cleaner. And even back then, I chose to use only natural cleaning products, partly because they were gentle, partly because I knew that was a great selling point for my clients. But it wasn’t until I trained as a holistic health practictioner that I began to fully understand the deeper cost of conventional cleaning chemicals, their impact on our hormones, our lungs, our microbiome, and the long-term health of our families. Cleaning, for me, isn’t just about tidying the surfaces of a home. It’s an energetic act. A way to tend to the spaces that support us, without harming the systems that sustain life. That’s why I made the switch. Over time, I’ve found simple, natural products that not only clean beautifully but also align with the values I want to live by. Below, I’m sharing my favorites, how I use them, what they do best, and how they tie into a permaculture lifestyle. You’ve probably seen the headlines that chemical cleaners can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), irritate the skin and respiratory system, and pollute waterways. But the impacts go deeper: Most conventional cleaners include synthetic fragrances, endocrine disruptors, and ingredients that are toxic when inhaled or absorbed (it takes roughly  seconds for these chemicals to absorb through your skin!). These compounds accumulate over time, particularly in small or poorly ventilated homes. Chemical-based cleaning agents don’t just vanish down the drain. They enter greywater systems, disrupt aquatic ecosystems, and are often packaged in single-use plastics. Natural cleaners, by contrast, are simple, accessible, and often multipurpose. And most importantly, they work. Here’s what’s always in my cupboard, plus a few personal tips on how I use them. A thick, olive-based soap paste or liquid that’s as gentle as it is powerful. Uses: Tip: I mix a teaspoon of savon noir with warm water and spray it on aphids in the garden. It’s a natural insecticide that doesn’t harm beneficial bugs when used sparingly. This powder releases oxygen when mixed with warm water, like hydrogen peroxide, but dry. Uses: Tip: Pour a tablespoon into the kitchen sink drain, add hot water, and wait. It’s excellent at breaking down grease and organic build-up, without toxic fumes. The ultimate multipurpose scrub and deodorizer. Uses: Tip: Mix it with a few drops of essential oil and store it in a jar to make a gentle scouring powder. Acidic, antibacterial, and endlessly useful (except on marble or granite). Uses: Tip: I pour it into a spray bottle with orange peels and let it infuse for two weeks. It smells wonderful and works beautifully on countertops. Naturally antiseptic and brightening. Uses: Tip: Half a lemon dipped in salt makes a great natural scrubber for soap scum or mineral deposits. Citrus essential oils (like orange, lemon, or grapefruit) are uplifting, antibacterial, and dissolve grease. Uses: Tip: Save all your citrus peels in a jar, cover them with vinegar, and leave it to infuse for – weeks. Strain and dilute for a citrus-scented all-purpose spray. Add a therapeutic, antimicrobial edge to your cleaning. Just a few drops go a long way. Uses: Tip: Add a few drops of lavender oil to baking soda and sprinkle on rugs before vacuuming. A ready-made paste of natural abrasives, ideal for tougher jobs. Uses: Tip: A little goes a long way. Let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing for best results. Traditional hard soap made from olive oil, gentle and biodegradable. Uses: Derived from citrus fruit, an excellent natural descaler. Uses: Stronger than baking soda, better for heavy-duty cleaning. Uses: If you’re just starting out, you don’t need to buy everything at once. Most natural cleaning routines can begin with just a few basic ingredients. Here’s what I recommend for your starter kit: You can do a lot with these: laundry, surface cleaning, drain unclogging, stain removal, and even garden maintenance. The more you experiment, the more confident and creative you’ll become. Living in alignment with permaculture practices isn’t just about how we grow our food; it’s about how we care for our spaces, our bodies, and our communities. Cleaning might seem like a small thing, but it touches every part of our daily lives. Here’s how natural cleaning ties into the core permaculture ethics: Choosing biodegradable, plant-based cleaners protects the water, soil, and air from synthetic pollution. It also helps reduce packaging waste. Many natural products can be bought in bulk, or even made from scraps. Natural cleaners are safer for children, pets, and anyone with sensitivities. They support healthier homes by reducing toxic load, hormone disruptors, and allergens. These products are usually more affordable in the long run and reduce dependency on corporations or plastic-heavy supply chains. DIY cleaners also promote resourcefulness and community sharing. Swap recipes, buy ingredients together, or share what works with your neighbors. One of my favorite things about natural cleaning is how often the “waste” becomes a resource. Citrus peels become infused vinegar. Old t-shirts become rags. Ashes from the stove can scrub glass. It’s a beautiful loop. Switching to natural cleaning products isn’t just a sustainability hack; it’s a mindset shift. It’s about moving from convenience to consciousness, from overconsumption to sufficiency. You don’t have to be perfect. Just start with one swap. Maybe vinegar instead of a spray bottle full of mystery chemicals. Baking soda under the sink instead of bleach. A little jar of orange peel cleaner that reminds you of the seasons and the land you live on. Cleaning this way feels good. Not just because my home is fresh and sparkling, but because it feels aligned. Aligned with my health, the earth, and the kind of future I want to help build. Have you tried any of these natural cleaning product swaps? Do you have a favorite DIY recipe? I’d love to hear about your experience, what’s worked, what hasn’t, and what surprised you. And if you’re just getting started: welcome. You’re not alone. This is one small, powerful step toward living in harmony with the earth, and I’m so glad you’re taking it.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Walk past a garden border and you might spot them – slender green spikes that look a bit like grass until you look closer. Chives are easy to overlook, yet these modest onion family members have been quietly useful in gardens and kitchens for centuries. They’re the perfect starter herb for beginners, while still earning their keep in the gardens of green-thumbed experts. Botanically speaking, chives (Allium schoenoprasum) are related to onions, garlic, leeks, and scallions in the Amaryllidaceae family. “Allium” comes from the Latin for garlic, while “schoenoprasum” combines Greek words for “rush” and “leek” – basically “reed-like leek,” which makes sense when you see them growing. Unlike their stronger-flavored cousins, chives won’t make you cry or leave your breath reeking. They have hollow, tubular leaves that grow - inches tall in dense clumps. Around early summer, they send up slightly taller stalks with round purple flower heads. These pom-pom blooms are both exceedingly pretty and edible, with a stronger onion punch than the leaves. Bees love them as well. Chives don’t have the dramatic history of some herbs (nobody started wars over chives), but they’ve been useful kitchen companions across the Northern Hemisphere for thousands of years. They grow wild in Europe, Asia, and North America, often in damp meadows and near streams. The Romans probably brought cultivated chives to Britain, using them for cooking and medicine. Marco Polo mentioned finding them widely used across China during his travels. He apparently brought some Asian varieties back to Europe, though probably not with the fanfare of his other discoveries. Medieval monks grew chives in their gardens, valuing them both as food flavoring and medicine. Hildegard of Bingen, a pretty remarkable th-century abbess and herbalist, wrote that chives helped digestion and circulation – uses that modern research hasn’t completely dismissed. One strange bit of history comes from Romania, where they were hung in houses alongside garlic to ward off vampires. More practically, Dutch dairy farmers noticed that cows grazing on pastures with wild chives produced better-tasting milk, so they started deliberately planting them in their fields. In Swedish folk medicine, bunches of chives were hung around homes during illness, supposedly to prevent disease from spreading. Seems odd now, but the antimicrobial compounds in alliums might actually have helped a bit in crowded living conditions. Chives are remarkably low-maintenance plants that thrive across much of the Northern Hemisphere. Unlike fussier Mediterranean herbs that need hot, dry conditions, chives handle cool weather and cold winters without complaint. They’re often among the first herbs to pop up in spring, sometimes even pushing through late snow. They grow best in fairly rich, well-drained soil that stays consistently moist but not waterlogged. Full sun works in cooler climates, but they appreciate afternoon shade in hotter regions. Once established, they’re surprisingly drought-tolerant, though they’ll look prettier with regular water. Most commercial chives come from China, Japan, and parts of Europe, but they’re more commonly grown in home gardens than as major agricultural crops. Their short shelf life after cutting means locally-grown chives are usually best for cooking. What makes chives particularly good for home gardens is their perennial nature and compact growth habit. A single planting can produce harvests for many years, slowly expanding into larger clumps that can be divided and replanted. They don’t take up much space and work well in containers, too. Chives might not be medical powerhouses like garlic, but they pack surprising benefits into those slender leaves: In Russia, mothers would hang bunches of chives over a sick child’s bed to help with colds and respiratory infections. While this might sound like pure superstition, the volatile compounds released might have helped clear congestion somewhat, like a very mild natural vapor rub. Though less myth-laden than some herbs, chives have collected their fair share of folk beliefs and superstitions. In parts of Eastern Europe, people planted chives on graves to keep evil spirits away from the deceased. More likely, the smell deterred scavenging animals, but the spiritual protection story probably sounded better. Chinese tradition held that giving someone chives as a gift symbolized long life and endurance – logical when you consider how stubbornly perennial these plants are. They come back year after year without much fuss. European farmers sometimes hung bunches of chives in cow stalls when animals were sick. While they explained this as driving away evil spirits causing illness, the strong smell might have actually helped repel certain insects or parasites. One particularly odd belief from Eastern Europe warned that pregnant women shouldn’t cut chives because it could cause their baby to be born with a cleft palate. This superstition probably arose because chive leaves themselves are hollow and split – a classic case of sympathetic magic where like supposedly affects like. Swiss Alpine shepherds sometimes decorated their lead cow with a garland including chives during the ceremonial autumn descent from mountain pastures. This celebrated the herbs that had supposedly improved their milk throughout the summer grazing season. For beginning gardeners, chives are about as fool-proof as herbs get. Here’s how to succeed with minimal effort: Start with seeds, divisions, or small plants from a garden center. Seeds need to be started indoors about - weeks before the last frost, then transplanted outside once established. Divisions from existing plants establish quickly and give you harvestable leaves much faster. Plant them in soil with some compost mixed in, spacing plants about - inches apart. Water regularly until established. They like consistent moisture but won’t immediately die if you forget to water occasionally. Don’t overfertilize – too much nitrogen makes for floppy, weak growth. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is plenty. Harvest by cutting leaves about  inches above the soil line using scissors. This encourages fresh growth and prevents woody stems. Regular cutting keeps plants productive, but avoid taking more than a third of a plant at once. Every - years, divide established clumps in early spring or fall. This rejuvenates the plants, prevents overcrowding, and gives you more chives to plant elsewhere or share with neighbors. Consider growing both regular chives and garlic chives (Allium tuberosum). The latter have flat leaves instead of round ones, a mild garlic flavor, and pretty white flowers that bloom later in summer than regular chives do. Beyond sprinkling them on potatoes, this herb has several practical uses: Nothing about chives screams for attention. They’re not flashy, exotic, or trendy. But their steady presence in gardens across the Northern Hemisphere speaks to their genuine usefulness. What makes chives worth growing? They don’t need coddling or special treatment. They grow happily in average soil with moderate water. They survive winter freezes that kill other herbs. They deter some garden pests while attracting beneficial insects. And they provide fresh flavor for most of the growing season, often starting earlier than other herbs in spring. These modest plants connect modern gardeners to centuries of herbal tradition while requiring almost no special knowledge to grow successfully. Sometimes the most valuable additions to our gardens aren’t the showiest or most exotic, but the quietly reliable ones that simply do their jobs without demanding much in return. Chives and green onions (also called scallions) are both alliums with a mild onion flavor, but they differ in appearance, texture, and culinary use. Chives are thin, hollow, grass-like herbs typically used as a garnish; their flavor is delicate and best enjoyed raw. Green onions, on the other hand, have a white bulb and green stalks, both of which are edible and often used in cooking. They offer a stronger, more onion-like taste and hold up better to heat, making them more versatile in sautés, stir-fries, and soups.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
We have been growing thyme in our gardens and kitchens for thousands of years. This humble herb might not grab attention like flashy basil or towering rosemary, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in staying power. Walk through any herb garden, and you’ll likely find thyme tucked somewhere, often spilling over the edges of paths, releasing its distinctive scent when stepped on. Thyme belongs to the mint family, with common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) being the variety most often found in gardens and kitchens. Its name comes from the Greek word “thymos,” which means courage or strength – fitting for a plant that survives in some pretty harsh conditions. With tiny, oval leaves growing on woody stems and small purple, pink, or white flowers, thyme might look delicate, but don’t be fooled – this herb is tough as nails. The fragrance of thyme is unique – woody, slightly floral, with hints of lemon, pepper, and something distinctly earthy. Crush a leaf between your fingers, and you’ll understand why this herb has captivated cooks and healers for centuries. Thyme’s relationship with humans stretches back to ancient Egypt, where it was used in embalming rituals. The Egyptians believed its aromatic properties would help the spirit on its journey to the afterlife. No pressure, little herb. The ancient Greeks burned thyme as incense in their temples, believing its smoke purified the space. Greek soldiers bathed in thyme-infused water before battle, supposedly to infuse themselves with courage and vigor. This association with bravery continued with the Romans, who offered thyme to those going into battle. In medieval Europe, thyme took on new significance. Ladies embroidered thyme sprigs on scarves for their knights heading to the Crusades as symbols of courage. Thyme also gained a reputation for warding off nightmares when placed under pillows – a practice that persisted for centuries. One particularly interesting chapter in thyme’s history involves the Black Death. During this devastating plague, people would carry posies containing thyme and other strong-smelling herbs, believing they provided protection against the disease. Modern science has since shown that thyme does indeed have powerful antiseptic properties – those medieval folks were onto something. The th-century English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper wrote that thyme was “a noble strengthener of the lungs” – another traditional use that modern research has partly validated, as thyme can help with respiratory conditions. Thyme is native to the Mediterranean region, which explains why it loves the sun and hates soggy soil. Take a hike through the hills of Greece or southern France and you’ll spot thyme tucked between rocks, growing happily in places that would kill most garden plants. Today, thyme grows throughout Europe, North Africa, Asia, and North America, having been spread by centuries of human cultivation. It’s adapted to a surprising range of climates, though it generally prefers hot, sunny positions and well-drained soil. In gardens, thyme often finds a home in rock gardens, between paving stones, or as a low-growing ground cover. Some varieties even substitute for lawn grass in low-traffic areas, creating a fragrant carpet that releases its scent when walked upon. The plant’s natural habitat explains its growing preferences: thyme absolutely hates wet feet. Plant it in waterlogged soil, and it will quickly rot. But give it some sandy or gravelly soil and plenty of sun, and it will reward you with years of growth from a single planting. People have been using thyme to treat various ailments for centuries, long before anyone understood why it worked. Modern research has finally caught up with what our ancestors somehow figured out through trial and error. The secret behind thyme’s medicinal power is its essential oil, especially a compound called thymol. Here’s what traditional healers used thyme for: I’ve tried making thyme steam for stuffy sinuses (just put fresh thyme in a bowl of hot water and breathe in the steam), and while I can’t prove anything scientifically, it definitely made breathing easier! Being an ancient and widespread herb, thyme has gathered its share of curious beliefs and superstitions. In European folklore, thyme was thought to attract fairies to gardens. Some claimed that patches of wild thyme marked places where fairies danced under the full moon. This association led to the planting of thyme in gardens not just for practical purposes but as an invitation to beneficial fairy folk. Scottish highlanders brewed a tea of wild thyme to provide “second sight” or prophetic visions – a practice that probably had more to do with thyme’s mild mood-altering properties than actual clairvoyance. In some parts of England, it was believed that a patch of wild thyme growing on a hillside indicated buried treasure beneath – perhaps because the plant often grows on rocky, mineral-rich soil that might contain ore deposits. Many cultures associated thyme with transitions and passages. In addition to its role in Egyptian funerary practices, some European traditions included placing sprigs of thyme in coffins to assure a safe passage to the afterlife. More happily, thyme was also incorporated into wedding bouquets and decorations to ensure courage and strength in the marriage. Thyme ranks among the easiest herbs to grow, making it perfect for beginning gardeners. It asks little and gives much in return. Starting thyme from seed requires patience, as germination can be slow and somewhat unpredictable. Most gardeners start with small plants purchased from nurseries or cuttings from established plants, which root readily in moist soil. The key to growing thyme successfully lies in mimicking its natural Mediterranean habitat: full sun, excellent drainage, and not too much fertilizer or water. In fact, thyme develops more intense flavor when grown in somewhat poor soil and allowed to dry out between waterings. In colder regions, thyme may die back in winter but usually recovers in spring. After several years, plants often become woody and less productive, at which point it’s best to replace them with fresh ones. Harvest thyme just before it flowers for the most concentrated flavor. Morning harvesting, after the dew has dried but before the day heats up, captures the highest concentration of essential oils. While we now know thyme primarily as a culinary herb, its uses extend far beyond the kitchen: From ancient Egyptian tombs to modern kitchen gardens, thyme has proven itself one of our most enduring herbal companions. Its stubborn ability to thrive in tough conditions mirrors the resilience it brings to those who use it – whether as food, medicine, or simple garden beauty. Something about thyme’s subtle, complex fragrance continues to draw us back, generation after generation. Perhaps it’s the way it connects us to our ancestors, who gathered wild thyme from Mediterranean hillsides and discovered its remarkable properties through centuries of use. Small as it is, thyme reminds us that sometimes the most unassuming plants carry the most profound gifts. The next time you brush past it in a garden or sprinkle it into a soup, remember you’re participating in a human tradition spanning thousands of years and countless cultures – all centered around a tiny herb with outsized importance.;Jardin Feuilles de Vie
Stroll through any garden, and you might be lucky to spot calendula officinalis — with its vibrant orange and yellow petals radiating just like miniature suns. Often mistaken for the common marigold, this bright flower has been cherished for centuries for its powerful healing properties, culinary charm, and symbolic significance across cultures. Scientifically known as Calendula officinalis, this member of the daisy family has been called “pot marigold,” “Mary’s gold,” and “Herb of the Sun,” among other names. But no matter what you call it, calendula’s legacy is deeply rooted in both modern herbalism and folk traditions. With its bright blossoms, slightly sticky stems, and long blooming season, calendula brings color and purpose to gardens and in the kitchen from early spring to the first frost — a true ally for both body and soul.  Calendula has a rich history that glows as bright as its petals. Ancient Egyptians valued calendula for its rejuvenating properties, using it in skin treatments and religious ceremonies. In Greek and Roman times, it adorned crowns, altars, and feasts, often associated with sun deities and festivals. Medieval European herbalists turned to calendula for everything from healing wounds to protecting against the plague. Its presence in church gardens and apothecaries was so widespread that it became known as the “herb of the sun,” believed to chase away darkness — both literal and metaphorical.  Calendula is a beloved edible flower of the kitchen. Chefs add its petals to soups, stews, and salads — hence the nickname “pot marigold” — for both color and a subtle peppery flavor. In times when saffron was far too expensive, calendula stood in as a worthy replacement. Folklore tells of using calendula in love potions, dreaming of one’s true love by placing petals under the pillow, and even divining the weather by watching whether its blossoms opened in the morning. If calendula failed to bloom, rain was on the way — an herbal barometer in bloom. Calendula originally hailed from southern Europe and the Mediterranean, but its adaptability has allowed it to travel far beyond its native region. It now thrives in gardens and meadows across North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. Unlike many delicate flowers, calendula prefers a bit of roughness. It grows best in average soil, full sun, and with minimal watering. In fact, too much pampering can lead to fewer blooms. Like many of the best things in life, calendula blooms brightest when left a little to its wild nature. Thanks to its long flowering season and ability to self-seed, calendula can feel almost eternal in the garden. One well-placed patch will usually return again and again — a perennial in spirit and by definition. Calendula’s healing gifts are abundant. Herbalists across the world have long turned to this plant for skin care, wound healing, and to help reduce inflammation — and modern science is catching up. Remarkably, calendula’s healing reputation spans the globe — from Ayurveda to European folk medicine, echoing a universal recognition of its gentle, effective powers. More than just medicine, calendula officinalis is steeped in symbolism and sacred meaning. In Christian folklore, calendula was associated with the Virgin Mary, often used to decorate altars and referred to as “Mary’s gold.” It became a flower of devotion and purity, appearing in religious paintings and sacred gardens. In Mexico, calendula (or a closely related variety) plays a central role in Día de los Muertos celebrations, believed to guide the spirits of the dead back to their families with its bright color and strong scent. It’s a flower of memory, of grief, and of connection between the worlds. In old European lore, calendula was considered protective — planted near homes to ward off evil, added to love charms to draw affection, and brewed in teas to bring visions or prophetic dreams. It was a flower of both magic and medicine. Calendula may just be one of the easiest and most rewarding herbs to grow at home. Sow seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, or start indoors a few weeks earlier. Calendula loves full sun and will bloom steadily until the first hard frost. Deadheading (removing spent flowers) encourages even more blooms, and its generous nature means you’ll have plenty to share. Even in pots or balcony planters, calendula does well — just make sure it gets at least  hours of sun per day and drains well. Once it’s established, calendula is fairly drought-resistant and requires little care. To harvest, pick the fully opened flowers in the morning once the dew has dried. Dry them in a warm, dark place and store them in airtight containers for use throughout the year. Calendula’s gifts go far beyond beauty and medicine. Here are a few simple ways to bring its sunshine into your daily life: From ancient rituals to modern remedies, calendula continues to shine as a botanical treasure. Its petals hold centuries of wisdom, yet its lessons remain timeless: Healing can be gentle, beauty can be practical, and some of the most powerful medicines bloom quietly beneath our feet. Whether you grow it, sip it, or simply admire it, calendula offers a radiant reminder of nature’s generosity — one sunny flower at a time. Calendula (Calendula officinalis) is often called “pot marigold,” but it is different from the ornamental marigold (Tagetes species) commonly seen in flower beds. Yes! Calendula is gentle and often used to soothe eczema, diaper rash, and irritated or dry skin. Dry the petals, infuse them in a carrier oil like olive or jojoba for – weeks, then strain and store in a dark glass container.;Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Creating a herbarium is a powerful way to connect with nature, document plant diversity, and gain a hands-on understanding of your local ecosystem. Traditionally, herbariums are collections of preserved plant specimens, carefully pressed and labeled to capture a wide array of botanical details. These collections have played an essential role in botany and plant science for centuries, enabling researchers to study plant species, track environmental changes, and preserve information about the natural world. But a herbarium isn’t just for scientists.

For nature enthusiasts, hobbyists, and even students, a personal herbarium is an invitation to learn more about the plants around them, whether it’s in the backyard, a nearby park, or an open field. I was inspired to create my own herbarium when I started diving into herbalism and permaculture. I realized that to truly understand plants, I needed a resource that combined both identification and practical uses in one place—a guidebook that could evolve over time and help me not only recognize plants but also understand how to use them for culinary and medicinal benefits. In this blog, I’ll share how to get started with your own herbarium, bringing together the worlds of botany and practical plant knowledge. For me, creating a herbarium was a way to document and explore the local edible plants, including some plants we would consider weeds! I loved the idea of capturing not only the plant’s physical traits but also noting where I found it, the season, and what other culinary or medicinal uses it might have. This practice deepened my understanding of each species and its role in the environment. Each specimen I gathered would usually include specific details about the plant, such as its: A herbarium can be as simple or as detailed as you like, making it a valuable resource for anyone passionate about the natural world. As I started building my herbarium, I wanted to combine botanical information with practical uses, creating a guide that was both a herbarium and a materia medica. Here’s how these two approaches differ: Combining these elements in my herbarium gave me a more comprehensive view: not only did I learn to identify plants, but I also began to understand their roles in herbalism, permaculture, and even in my kitchen. I’ve always been drawn to understanding the plants around me, but creating a herbarium gave me a way to dive deeper into local ecosystems and the diversity found there. With a herbarium, I felt more empowered to learn and document without needing a formal biology or science background. There are different ways to create a herbarium, each with its own advantages depending on your interests and needs. To start, decide what you want your herbarium to focus on. It could be backyard forageables, medicinal plants, or even seasonal blooms. Having a theme can make your herbarium more cohesive and give you a clear idea of what plants to look for. Included in my herbarium, I list out the following: When collecting plants, be mindful of the environment. Avoid overharvesting and try to gather only from sustainable areas. Note the habitat and other details so you can accurately document your specimen. Start by choosing healthy, fresh specimens. Place each plant between sheets of absorbent paper to prevent moisture from damaging it. Stack these within a plant press or heavy books, checking every few days and replacing the paper to avoid mold. In two to three weeks, your plant will be fully pressed and ready to store. Drying times depend on the plant’s moisture content and thickness. Typically, two to four weeks is sufficient for most plants. Keep the press in a warm, dry space to speed up the process, and avoid microwave techniques if you want to preserve natural colors. Choose vibrant, healthy specimens to help retain color. Use acid-free paper to prevent yellowing and avoid direct sunlight while drying. For long-term storage, a cool, dry place works best, and UV-resistant spray can help preserve colors. Labeling is essential to keeping your herbarium organized. Include details like the plant’s common and botanical names, location, date of collection, and habitat notes. Get creative with your labels—add sketches, use natural ink, or try botanical names for an extra educational touch. Each season brings its own unique plants to discover. In spring, look for early blooms like violets and dandelions. Summer offers herbs like mint and yarrow, while autumn brings plants like goldenrod and sage. Adding seasonal plants not only diversifies your collection but helps you learn the rhythms of nature. Before foraging, research local regulations to ensure you’re gathering plants legally and ethically. Some common, safe-to-forage plants include dandelions, nettles, and clover. Always be mindful of protected species, and remember to harvest sustainably. Creating a personal herbarium is a journey that deepens your connection to nature, allowing you to learn, explore, and document the world around you. Whether for personal enrichment, practical uses, or sharing knowledge with family and friends, a herbarium is a rewarding project that you can continue to build over time. Start your own herbarium today and let it become a cherished resource for you and future generations. ";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"In the realm of wild herbs, yarrow (Achillea millefolium) stands out for its myriad of health benefits and historical significance in herbal medicine. This resilient and easy-to-identify plant, with its distinctive feathery foliage and clusters of tiny, white to pink flowers, has been revered through the ages for its medicinal properties. As we explore the benefits and uses of yarrow, it becomes evident why this plant deserves a place in both our gardens and our natural health toolkit. In this article we are going to cover: Yarrow grows nearly worldwide in temperate locations. It isn’t a picky herb and will grow almost anywhere including coastal and mountainous regions. It is common to find them in meadows, fields, backyards, and disturbed areas. Foraging for yarrow is a rewarding endeavor, offering an opportunity to connect with nature and discover the plant’s potent properties firsthand. When foraging for yarrow, consider the following: Yarrow is a wooly perennial plant with feather-like leaves. It has a tall flower stalk (- feet) that ends in a cluster of small, daisy-like flowers. The flowers of wild yarrow are white or pink. Cultivated varieties can be yellow, orange, or red. One of the defining characteristics of yarrow is the distinctive filly leaves, which helps to distinguish it from look-alikes. Yarrow has a scent that is reminiscent of fresh pine needles. It also has a grooved stem with wooly hairs. Yarrow is most often confused with Queen Anne’s lace (Daucus carota), which is not toxic. Queen Anne’s lace has a true umbel-shaped flower, often with a dark-colored dot in the middle, a hairy stem, and smells of carrots. Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum) may look somewhat similar to yarrow when it is young, but grow to become much larger. It has purple-spotted stems. Yarrow is more than just a pretty face; it boasts a plethora of health benefits that have been utilized in traditional medicine for centuries: While yarrow is best known for its medicinal applications, it also has a place in the kitchen. Its bitter and aromatic qualities make it a unique herb for culinary experimentation: While yarrow is generally safe for most people, it’s important to note that it can cause allergic reactions in individuals sensitive to the Asteraceae family, which includes ragweed, chrysanthemums, and daisies. Pregnant and nursing women should avoid consuming yarrow, as its effects during pregnancy and lactation are not well studied. Yarrow is best used fresh whenever possible. It can be dried for later use. Hang flower stalks in upside-down bundles to dry or spread leaves and flowers out in a basket or drying screen. In milder climates, the leaves can be harvested year-round. Yarrow’s multifaceted benefits highlight the plant’s significance in both traditional and modern herbal practices. Whether you’re drawn to its healing properties, culinary potential, or simply its wild beauty, yarrow offers a profound connection to the healing power of nature. As you explore the uses of this remarkable herb, let it inspire a deeper appreciation for the plants that share our world and the ancient wisdom they hold.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Natural cleaning products are advertised everywhere, but are they worth it? Before I ever lived in the countryside or studied permaculture, I worked as a house cleaner. And even back then, I chose to use only natural cleaning products, partly because they were gentle, partly because I knew that was a great selling point for my clients. But it wasn’t until I trained as a holistic health practictioner that I began to fully understand the deeper cost of conventional cleaning chemicals, their impact on our hormones, our lungs, our microbiome, and the long-term health of our families. Cleaning, for me, isn’t just about tidying the surfaces of a home. It’s an energetic act. A way to tend to the spaces that support us, without harming the systems that sustain life. That’s why I made the switch. Over time, I’ve found simple, natural products that not only clean beautifully but also align with the values I want to live by. Below, I’m sharing my favorites, how I use them, what they do best, and how they tie into a permaculture lifestyle. You’ve probably seen the headlines that chemical cleaners can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), irritate the skin and respiratory system, and pollute waterways. But the impacts go deeper: Most conventional cleaners include synthetic fragrances, endocrine disruptors, and ingredients that are toxic when inhaled or absorbed (it takes roughly  seconds for these chemicals to absorb through your skin!). These compounds accumulate over time, particularly in small or poorly ventilated homes. Chemical-based cleaning agents don’t just vanish down the drain. They enter greywater systems, disrupt aquatic ecosystems, and are often packaged in single-use plastics. Natural cleaners, by contrast, are simple, accessible, and often multipurpose. And most importantly, they work. Here’s what’s always in my cupboard, plus a few personal tips on how I use them. A thick, olive-based soap paste or liquid that’s as gentle as it is powerful. Uses: Tip: I mix a teaspoon of savon noir with warm water and spray it on aphids in the garden. It’s a natural insecticide that doesn’t harm beneficial bugs when used sparingly. This powder releases oxygen when mixed with warm water, like hydrogen peroxide, but dry. Uses: Tip: Pour a tablespoon into the kitchen sink drain, add hot water, and wait. It’s excellent at breaking down grease and organic build-up, without toxic fumes. The ultimate multipurpose scrub and deodorizer. Uses: Tip: Mix it with a few drops of essential oil and store it in a jar to make a gentle scouring powder. Acidic, antibacterial, and endlessly useful (except on marble or granite). Uses: Tip: I pour it into a spray bottle with orange peels and let it infuse for two weeks. It smells wonderful and works beautifully on countertops. Naturally antiseptic and brightening. Uses: Tip: Half a lemon dipped in salt makes a great natural scrubber for soap scum or mineral deposits. Citrus essential oils (like orange, lemon, or grapefruit) are uplifting, antibacterial, and dissolve grease. Uses: Tip: Save all your citrus peels in a jar, cover them with vinegar, and leave it to infuse for – weeks. Strain and dilute for a citrus-scented all-purpose spray. Add a therapeutic, antimicrobial edge to your cleaning. Just a few drops go a long way. Uses: Tip: Add a few drops of lavender oil to baking soda and sprinkle on rugs before vacuuming. A ready-made paste of natural abrasives, ideal for tougher jobs. Uses: Tip: A little goes a long way. Let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing for best results. Traditional hard soap made from olive oil, gentle and biodegradable. Uses: Derived from citrus fruit, an excellent natural descaler. Uses: Stronger than baking soda, better for heavy-duty cleaning. Uses: If you’re just starting out, you don’t need to buy everything at once. Most natural cleaning routines can begin with just a few basic ingredients. Here’s what I recommend for your starter kit: You can do a lot with these: laundry, surface cleaning, drain unclogging, stain removal, and even garden maintenance. The more you experiment, the more confident and creative you’ll become. Living in alignment with permaculture practices isn’t just about how we grow our food; it’s about how we care for our spaces, our bodies, and our communities. Cleaning might seem like a small thing, but it touches every part of our daily lives. Here’s how natural cleaning ties into the core permaculture ethics: Choosing biodegradable, plant-based cleaners protects the water, soil, and air from synthetic pollution. It also helps reduce packaging waste. Many natural products can be bought in bulk, or even made from scraps. Natural cleaners are safer for children, pets, and anyone with sensitivities. They support healthier homes by reducing toxic load, hormone disruptors, and allergens. These products are usually more affordable in the long run and reduce dependency on corporations or plastic-heavy supply chains. DIY cleaners also promote resourcefulness and community sharing. Swap recipes, buy ingredients together, or share what works with your neighbors. One of my favorite things about natural cleaning is how often the “waste” becomes a resource. Citrus peels become infused vinegar. Old t-shirts become rags. Ashes from the stove can scrub glass. It’s a beautiful loop. Switching to natural cleaning products isn’t just a sustainability hack; it’s a mindset shift. It’s about moving from convenience to consciousness, from overconsumption to sufficiency. You don’t have to be perfect. Just start with one swap. Maybe vinegar instead of a spray bottle full of mystery chemicals. Baking soda under the sink instead of bleach. A little jar of orange peel cleaner that reminds you of the seasons and the land you live on. Cleaning this way feels good. Not just because my home is fresh and sparkling, but because it feels aligned. Aligned with my health, the earth, and the kind of future I want to help build. Have you tried any of these natural cleaning product swaps? Do you have a favorite DIY recipe? I’d love to hear about your experience, what’s worked, what hasn’t, and what surprised you. And if you’re just getting started: welcome. You’re not alone. This is one small, powerful step toward living in harmony with the earth, and I’m so glad you’re taking it.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Walk past a garden border and you might spot them – slender green spikes that look a bit like grass until you look closer. Chives are easy to overlook, yet these modest onion family members have been quietly useful in gardens and kitchens for centuries. They’re the perfect starter herb for beginners, while still earning their keep in the gardens of green-thumbed experts. Botanically speaking, chives (Allium schoenoprasum) are related to onions, garlic, leeks, and scallions in the Amaryllidaceae family. “Allium” comes from the Latin for garlic, while “schoenoprasum” combines Greek words for “rush” and “leek” – basically “reed-like leek,” which makes sense when you see them growing. Unlike their stronger-flavored cousins, chives won’t make you cry or leave your breath reeking. They have hollow, tubular leaves that grow - inches tall in dense clumps. Around early summer, they send up slightly taller stalks with round purple flower heads. These pom-pom blooms are both exceedingly pretty and edible, with a stronger onion punch than the leaves. Bees love them as well. Chives don’t have the dramatic history of some herbs (nobody started wars over chives), but they’ve been useful kitchen companions across the Northern Hemisphere for thousands of years. They grow wild in Europe, Asia, and North America, often in damp meadows and near streams. The Romans probably brought cultivated chives to Britain, using them for cooking and medicine. Marco Polo mentioned finding them widely used across China during his travels. He apparently brought some Asian varieties back to Europe, though probably not with the fanfare of his other discoveries. Medieval monks grew chives in their gardens, valuing them both as food flavoring and medicine. Hildegard of Bingen, a pretty remarkable th-century abbess and herbalist, wrote that chives helped digestion and circulation – uses that modern research hasn’t completely dismissed. One strange bit of history comes from Romania, where they were hung in houses alongside garlic to ward off vampires. More practically, Dutch dairy farmers noticed that cows grazing on pastures with wild chives produced better-tasting milk, so they started deliberately planting them in their fields. In Swedish folk medicine, bunches of chives were hung around homes during illness, supposedly to prevent disease from spreading. Seems odd now, but the antimicrobial compounds in alliums might actually have helped a bit in crowded living conditions. Chives are remarkably low-maintenance plants that thrive across much of the Northern Hemisphere. Unlike fussier Mediterranean herbs that need hot, dry conditions, chives handle cool weather and cold winters without complaint. They’re often among the first herbs to pop up in spring, sometimes even pushing through late snow. They grow best in fairly rich, well-drained soil that stays consistently moist but not waterlogged. Full sun works in cooler climates, but they appreciate afternoon shade in hotter regions. Once established, they’re surprisingly drought-tolerant, though they’ll look prettier with regular water. Most commercial chives come from China, Japan, and parts of Europe, but they’re more commonly grown in home gardens than as major agricultural crops. Their short shelf life after cutting means locally-grown chives are usually best for cooking. What makes chives particularly good for home gardens is their perennial nature and compact growth habit. A single planting can produce harvests for many years, slowly expanding into larger clumps that can be divided and replanted. They don’t take up much space and work well in containers, too. Chives might not be medical powerhouses like garlic, but they pack surprising benefits into those slender leaves: In Russia, mothers would hang bunches of chives over a sick child’s bed to help with colds and respiratory infections. While this might sound like pure superstition, the volatile compounds released might have helped clear congestion somewhat, like a very mild natural vapor rub. Though less myth-laden than some herbs, chives have collected their fair share of folk beliefs and superstitions. In parts of Eastern Europe, people planted chives on graves to keep evil spirits away from the deceased. More likely, the smell deterred scavenging animals, but the spiritual protection story probably sounded better. Chinese tradition held that giving someone chives as a gift symbolized long life and endurance – logical when you consider how stubbornly perennial these plants are. They come back year after year without much fuss. European farmers sometimes hung bunches of chives in cow stalls when animals were sick. While they explained this as driving away evil spirits causing illness, the strong smell might have actually helped repel certain insects or parasites. One particularly odd belief from Eastern Europe warned that pregnant women shouldn’t cut chives because it could cause their baby to be born with a cleft palate. This superstition probably arose because chive leaves themselves are hollow and split – a classic case of sympathetic magic where like supposedly affects like. Swiss Alpine shepherds sometimes decorated their lead cow with a garland including chives during the ceremonial autumn descent from mountain pastures. This celebrated the herbs that had supposedly improved their milk throughout the summer grazing season. For beginning gardeners, chives are about as fool-proof as herbs get. Here’s how to succeed with minimal effort: Start with seeds, divisions, or small plants from a garden center. Seeds need to be started indoors about - weeks before the last frost, then transplanted outside once established. Divisions from existing plants establish quickly and give you harvestable leaves much faster. Plant them in soil with some compost mixed in, spacing plants about - inches apart. Water regularly until established. They like consistent moisture but won’t immediately die if you forget to water occasionally. Don’t overfertilize – too much nitrogen makes for floppy, weak growth. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is plenty. Harvest by cutting leaves about  inches above the soil line using scissors. This encourages fresh growth and prevents woody stems. Regular cutting keeps plants productive, but avoid taking more than a third of a plant at once. Every - years, divide established clumps in early spring or fall. This rejuvenates the plants, prevents overcrowding, and gives you more chives to plant elsewhere or share with neighbors. Consider growing both regular chives and garlic chives (Allium tuberosum). The latter have flat leaves instead of round ones, a mild garlic flavor, and pretty white flowers that bloom later in summer than regular chives do. Beyond sprinkling them on potatoes, this herb has several practical uses: Nothing about chives screams for attention. They’re not flashy, exotic, or trendy. But their steady presence in gardens across the Northern Hemisphere speaks to their genuine usefulness. What makes chives worth growing? They don’t need coddling or special treatment. They grow happily in average soil with moderate water. They survive winter freezes that kill other herbs. They deter some garden pests while attracting beneficial insects. And they provide fresh flavor for most of the growing season, often starting earlier than other herbs in spring. These modest plants connect modern gardeners to centuries of herbal tradition while requiring almost no special knowledge to grow successfully. Sometimes the most valuable additions to our gardens aren’t the showiest or most exotic, but the quietly reliable ones that simply do their jobs without demanding much in return. Chives and green onions (also called scallions) are both alliums with a mild onion flavor, but they differ in appearance, texture, and culinary use. Chives are thin, hollow, grass-like herbs typically used as a garnish; their flavor is delicate and best enjoyed raw. Green onions, on the other hand, have a white bulb and green stalks, both of which are edible and often used in cooking. They offer a stronger, more onion-like taste and hold up better to heat, making them more versatile in sautés, stir-fries, and soups.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
We have been growing thyme in our gardens and kitchens for thousands of years. This humble herb might not grab attention like flashy basil or towering rosemary, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in staying power. Walk through any herb garden, and you’ll likely find thyme tucked somewhere, often spilling over the edges of paths, releasing its distinctive scent when stepped on. Thyme belongs to the mint family, with common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) being the variety most often found in gardens and kitchens. Its name comes from the Greek word “thymos,” which means courage or strength – fitting for a plant that survives in some pretty harsh conditions. With tiny, oval leaves growing on woody stems and small purple, pink, or white flowers, thyme might look delicate, but don’t be fooled – this herb is tough as nails. The fragrance of thyme is unique – woody, slightly floral, with hints of lemon, pepper, and something distinctly earthy. Crush a leaf between your fingers, and you’ll understand why this herb has captivated cooks and healers for centuries. Thyme’s relationship with humans stretches back to ancient Egypt, where it was used in embalming rituals. The Egyptians believed its aromatic properties would help the spirit on its journey to the afterlife. No pressure, little herb. The ancient Greeks burned thyme as incense in their temples, believing its smoke purified the space. Greek soldiers bathed in thyme-infused water before battle, supposedly to infuse themselves with courage and vigor. This association with bravery continued with the Romans, who offered thyme to those going into battle. In medieval Europe, thyme took on new significance. Ladies embroidered thyme sprigs on scarves for their knights heading to the Crusades as symbols of courage. Thyme also gained a reputation for warding off nightmares when placed under pillows – a practice that persisted for centuries. One particularly interesting chapter in thyme’s history involves the Black Death. During this devastating plague, people would carry posies containing thyme and other strong-smelling herbs, believing they provided protection against the disease. Modern science has since shown that thyme does indeed have powerful antiseptic properties – those medieval folks were onto something. The th-century English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper wrote that thyme was “a noble strengthener of the lungs” – another traditional use that modern research has partly validated, as thyme can help with respiratory conditions. Thyme is native to the Mediterranean region, which explains why it loves the sun and hates soggy soil. Take a hike through the hills of Greece or southern France and you’ll spot thyme tucked between rocks, growing happily in places that would kill most garden plants. Today, thyme grows throughout Europe, North Africa, Asia, and North America, having been spread by centuries of human cultivation. It’s adapted to a surprising range of climates, though it generally prefers hot, sunny positions and well-drained soil. In gardens, thyme often finds a home in rock gardens, between paving stones, or as a low-growing ground cover. Some varieties even substitute for lawn grass in low-traffic areas, creating a fragrant carpet that releases its scent when walked upon. The plant’s natural habitat explains its growing preferences: thyme absolutely hates wet feet. Plant it in waterlogged soil, and it will quickly rot. But give it some sandy or gravelly soil and plenty of sun, and it will reward you with years of growth from a single planting. People have been using thyme to treat various ailments for centuries, long before anyone understood why it worked. Modern research has finally caught up with what our ancestors somehow figured out through trial and error. The secret behind thyme’s medicinal power is its essential oil, especially a compound called thymol. Here’s what traditional healers used thyme for: I’ve tried making thyme steam for stuffy sinuses (just put fresh thyme in a bowl of hot water and breathe in the steam), and while I can’t prove anything scientifically, it definitely made breathing easier! Being an ancient and widespread herb, thyme has gathered its share of curious beliefs and superstitions. In European folklore, thyme was thought to attract fairies to gardens. Some claimed that patches of wild thyme marked places where fairies danced under the full moon. This association led to the planting of thyme in gardens not just for practical purposes but as an invitation to beneficial fairy folk. Scottish highlanders brewed a tea of wild thyme to provide “second sight” or prophetic visions – a practice that probably had more to do with thyme’s mild mood-altering properties than actual clairvoyance. In some parts of England, it was believed that a patch of wild thyme growing on a hillside indicated buried treasure beneath – perhaps because the plant often grows on rocky, mineral-rich soil that might contain ore deposits. Many cultures associated thyme with transitions and passages. In addition to its role in Egyptian funerary practices, some European traditions included placing sprigs of thyme in coffins to assure a safe passage to the afterlife. More happily, thyme was also incorporated into wedding bouquets and decorations to ensure courage and strength in the marriage. Thyme ranks among the easiest herbs to grow, making it perfect for beginning gardeners. It asks little and gives much in return. Starting thyme from seed requires patience, as germination can be slow and somewhat unpredictable. Most gardeners start with small plants purchased from nurseries or cuttings from established plants, which root readily in moist soil. The key to growing thyme successfully lies in mimicking its natural Mediterranean habitat: full sun, excellent drainage, and not too much fertilizer or water. In fact, thyme develops more intense flavor when grown in somewhat poor soil and allowed to dry out between waterings. In colder regions, thyme may die back in winter but usually recovers in spring. After several years, plants often become woody and less productive, at which point it’s best to replace them with fresh ones. Harvest thyme just before it flowers for the most concentrated flavor. Morning harvesting, after the dew has dried but before the day heats up, captures the highest concentration of essential oils. While we now know thyme primarily as a culinary herb, its uses extend far beyond the kitchen: From ancient Egyptian tombs to modern kitchen gardens, thyme has proven itself one of our most enduring herbal companions. Its stubborn ability to thrive in tough conditions mirrors the resilience it brings to those who use it – whether as food, medicine, or simple garden beauty. Something about thyme’s subtle, complex fragrance continues to draw us back, generation after generation. Perhaps it’s the way it connects us to our ancestors, who gathered wild thyme from Mediterranean hillsides and discovered its remarkable properties through centuries of use. Small as it is, thyme reminds us that sometimes the most unassuming plants carry the most profound gifts. The next time you brush past it in a garden or sprinkle it into a soup, remember you’re participating in a human tradition spanning thousands of years and countless cultures – all centered around a tiny herb with outsized importance.;Jardin Feuilles de Vie
Stroll through any garden, and you might be lucky to spot calendula officinalis — with its vibrant orange and yellow petals radiating just like miniature suns. Often mistaken for the common marigold, this bright flower has been cherished for centuries for its powerful healing properties, culinary charm, and symbolic significance across cultures. Scientifically known as Calendula officinalis, this member of the daisy family has been called “pot marigold,” “Mary’s gold,” and “Herb of the Sun,” among other names. But no matter what you call it, calendula’s legacy is deeply rooted in both modern herbalism and folk traditions. With its bright blossoms, slightly sticky stems, and long blooming season, calendula brings color and purpose to gardens and in the kitchen from early spring to the first frost — a true ally for both body and soul.  Calendula has a rich history that glows as bright as its petals. Ancient Egyptians valued calendula for its rejuvenating properties, using it in skin treatments and religious ceremonies. In Greek and Roman times, it adorned crowns, altars, and feasts, often associated with sun deities and festivals. Medieval European herbalists turned to calendula for everything from healing wounds to protecting against the plague. Its presence in church gardens and apothecaries was so widespread that it became known as the “herb of the sun,” believed to chase away darkness — both literal and metaphorical.  Calendula is a beloved edible flower of the kitchen. Chefs add its petals to soups, stews, and salads — hence the nickname “pot marigold” — for both color and a subtle peppery flavor. In times when saffron was far too expensive, calendula stood in as a worthy replacement. Folklore tells of using calendula in love potions, dreaming of one’s true love by placing petals under the pillow, and even divining the weather by watching whether its blossoms opened in the morning. If calendula failed to bloom, rain was on the way — an herbal barometer in bloom. Calendula originally hailed from southern Europe and the Mediterranean, but its adaptability has allowed it to travel far beyond its native region. It now thrives in gardens and meadows across North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. Unlike many delicate flowers, calendula prefers a bit of roughness. It grows best in average soil, full sun, and with minimal watering. In fact, too much pampering can lead to fewer blooms. Like many of the best things in life, calendula blooms brightest when left a little to its wild nature. Thanks to its long flowering season and ability to self-seed, calendula can feel almost eternal in the garden. One well-placed patch will usually return again and again — a perennial in spirit and by definition. Calendula’s healing gifts are abundant. Herbalists across the world have long turned to this plant for skin care, wound healing, and to help reduce inflammation — and modern science is catching up. Remarkably, calendula’s healing reputation spans the globe — from Ayurveda to European folk medicine, echoing a universal recognition of its gentle, effective powers. More than just medicine, calendula officinalis is steeped in symbolism and sacred meaning. In Christian folklore, calendula was associated with the Virgin Mary, often used to decorate altars and referred to as “Mary’s gold.” It became a flower of devotion and purity, appearing in religious paintings and sacred gardens. In Mexico, calendula (or a closely related variety) plays a central role in Día de los Muertos celebrations, believed to guide the spirits of the dead back to their families with its bright color and strong scent. It’s a flower of memory, of grief, and of connection between the worlds. In old European lore, calendula was considered protective — planted near homes to ward off evil, added to love charms to draw affection, and brewed in teas to bring visions or prophetic dreams. It was a flower of both magic and medicine. Calendula may just be one of the easiest and most rewarding herbs to grow at home. Sow seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, or start indoors a few weeks earlier. Calendula loves full sun and will bloom steadily until the first hard frost. Deadheading (removing spent flowers) encourages even more blooms, and its generous nature means you’ll have plenty to share. Even in pots or balcony planters, calendula does well — just make sure it gets at least  hours of sun per day and drains well. Once it’s established, calendula is fairly drought-resistant and requires little care. To harvest, pick the fully opened flowers in the morning once the dew has dried. Dry them in a warm, dark place and store them in airtight containers for use throughout the year. Calendula’s gifts go far beyond beauty and medicine. Here are a few simple ways to bring its sunshine into your daily life: From ancient rituals to modern remedies, calendula continues to shine as a botanical treasure. Its petals hold centuries of wisdom, yet its lessons remain timeless: Healing can be gentle, beauty can be practical, and some of the most powerful medicines bloom quietly beneath our feet. Whether you grow it, sip it, or simply admire it, calendula offers a radiant reminder of nature’s generosity — one sunny flower at a time. Calendula (Calendula officinalis) is often called “pot marigold,” but it is different from the ornamental marigold (Tagetes species) commonly seen in flower beds. Yes! Calendula is gentle and often used to soothe eczema, diaper rash, and irritated or dry skin. Dry the petals, infuse them in a carrier oil like olive or jojoba for – weeks, then strain and store in a dark glass container.;Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Creating a herbarium is a powerful way to connect with nature, document plant diversity, and gain a hands-on understanding of your local ecosystem. Traditionally, herbariums are collections of preserved plant specimens, carefully pressed and labeled to capture a wide array of botanical details. These collections have played an essential role in botany and plant science for centuries, enabling researchers to study plant species, track environmental changes, and preserve information about the natural world. But a herbarium isn’t just for scientists.

For nature enthusiasts, hobbyists, and even students, a personal herbarium is an invitation to learn more about the plants around them, whether it’s in the backyard, a nearby park, or an open field. I was inspired to create my own herbarium when I started diving into herbalism and permaculture. I realized that to truly understand plants, I needed a resource that combined both identification and practical uses in one place—a guidebook that could evolve over time and help me not only recognize plants but also understand how to use them for culinary and medicinal benefits. In this blog, I’ll share how to get started with your own herbarium, bringing together the worlds of botany and practical plant knowledge. For me, creating a herbarium was a way to document and explore the local edible plants, including some plants we would consider weeds! I loved the idea of capturing not only the plant’s physical traits but also noting where I found it, the season, and what other culinary or medicinal uses it might have. This practice deepened my understanding of each species and its role in the environment. Each specimen I gathered would usually include specific details about the plant, such as its: A herbarium can be as simple or as detailed as you like, making it a valuable resource for anyone passionate about the natural world. As I started building my herbarium, I wanted to combine botanical information with practical uses, creating a guide that was both a herbarium and a materia medica. Here’s how these two approaches differ: Combining these elements in my herbarium gave me a more comprehensive view: not only did I learn to identify plants, but I also began to understand their roles in herbalism, permaculture, and even in my kitchen. I’ve always been drawn to understanding the plants around me, but creating a herbarium gave me a way to dive deeper into local ecosystems and the diversity found there. With a herbarium, I felt more empowered to learn and document without needing a formal biology or science background. There are different ways to create a herbarium, each with its own advantages depending on your interests and needs. To start, decide what you want your herbarium to focus on. It could be backyard forageables, medicinal plants, or even seasonal blooms. Having a theme can make your herbarium more cohesive and give you a clear idea of what plants to look for. Included in my herbarium, I list out the following: When collecting plants, be mindful of the environment. Avoid overharvesting and try to gather only from sustainable areas. Note the habitat and other details so you can accurately document your specimen. Start by choosing healthy, fresh specimens. Place each plant between sheets of absorbent paper to prevent moisture from damaging it. Stack these within a plant press or heavy books, checking every few days and replacing the paper to avoid mold. In two to three weeks, your plant will be fully pressed and ready to store. Drying times depend on the plant’s moisture content and thickness. Typically, two to four weeks is sufficient for most plants. Keep the press in a warm, dry space to speed up the process, and avoid microwave techniques if you want to preserve natural colors. Choose vibrant, healthy specimens to help retain color. Use acid-free paper to prevent yellowing and avoid direct sunlight while drying. For long-term storage, a cool, dry place works best, and UV-resistant spray can help preserve colors. Labeling is essential to keeping your herbarium organized. Include details like the plant’s common and botanical names, location, date of collection, and habitat notes. Get creative with your labels—add sketches, use natural ink, or try botanical names for an extra educational touch. Each season brings its own unique plants to discover. In spring, look for early blooms like violets and dandelions. Summer offers herbs like mint and yarrow, while autumn brings plants like goldenrod and sage. Adding seasonal plants not only diversifies your collection but helps you learn the rhythms of nature. Before foraging, research local regulations to ensure you’re gathering plants legally and ethically. Some common, safe-to-forage plants include dandelions, nettles, and clover. Always be mindful of protected species, and remember to harvest sustainably. Creating a personal herbarium is a journey that deepens your connection to nature, allowing you to learn, explore, and document the world around you. Whether for personal enrichment, practical uses, or sharing knowledge with family and friends, a herbarium is a rewarding project that you can continue to build over time. Start your own herbarium today and let it become a cherished resource for you and future generations. ";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"It feels strange to say it out loud: we moved. We left our little  m² permaculture garden. We left Switzerland. And we started over, again. If you’ve been following us for a while, you’ve probably noticed the silence. No new updates from the garden. No fresh videos showing our seasonal shifts. And that’s because, behind the scenes, our lives were changing completely. On December st, , we found our forever home in France. After months of searching and months more of battling bank paperwork as independents, we bought a house in the middle of the forest, in a quiet corner of Les Vosges, France. The property is over , m², nearly . hectares, with , m² of forest alone. It’s more than we ever dreamed. And somehow, exactly what we were looking for. Back in Switzerland, we had carved out a beautiful life. A lake nearby. A compact but thriving permaculture garden. A community that had grown around it. But something inside both of us kept whispering: Let’s go deeper! What if we had space to not just garden, but to regenerate? Not just to grow food, but to steward land, plant forests, raise animals, and build something that would last beyond us? We were craving silence. Space. Wildness. Freedom. And then we found this place (video below has English subtitles!). When we first stepped onto the property, we knew it was different. It wasn’t just the land, it was the feeling. A resounding feeling in all of us that this is where we are meant to be. There’s a greenhouse already in place, tucked against a small hill. Rocky terrain laced with iron. Clay and sand, and a natural water source. A pond that isn’t technically ours, yet, but one that holds stories older than just this property. And a house. Solid and beautiful, built in the s by people who cared. The owner even built the stone walls around the garden himself. It felt lived-in. Held. Loved. That mattered to us. We’ve only scratched the surface of this land. It holds secrets in its soil and in its stones. Ancient ones. The trees here are different. The soil is different. The air is damp, lush, and alive. We’re at nearly the same elevation as before (m), but the climate couldn’t be more different. Here the plants speak a different language. We’re learning. Slowly. Many of the trees we don’t yet know by name. Some feel familiar, hazelnuts, crabapple, oak, blackberries, and pines. Others are still strangers. If you spot anything familiar in our photos or videos, please let us know in the comments. One of the most surprising joys of this shift has been to see the abundance of life. Not just the plants, but the animals. Since arriving, we’ve seen wild boars, foxes, deer, and even a nutria by the pond. We’ve watched crayfish scuttle across the road and in the stream next to the house. Lizards warming themselves on sun-soaked stones. And insects, so many insects!! Bees, beetles, wasps, dragonflies, and the occasional tick (of course). We’ve also met our neighbors: cows. Dozens of them. Calm, quiet, curious. They graze just over the fence and seem content to share the silence (these ones don’t have bells like in Switzerland!). We’re not starting from scratch, exactly. But we are starting fresh. The greenhouse will soon be full of sprouts. The rocky ground will need compost, mulch, cover crops, and layers of care. The forest will evolve into something between wild woodland and an edible paradise. I dream of a food forest full of hazelnuts, berries, medicinal plants, and trees for firewood. And yes, we’ve already built a composting system and garden bed! (If you’re curious how we built this system, check out our DIY Pallet Compost Guide for the full how-to.) There’s also a small wooden outbuilding waiting to become a home for rabbits, chickens, ducks, and maybe, eventually, a few sheep. These aren’t just for food or company. In permaculture, every animal has a role to play: managing pests, fertilizing soil, trimming grass, or teaching us patience. This place doesn’t just hold potential. It holds history. We’ve found old dry-stone walls, giant carved stones that feel like something from a Celtic storybook. And according to local lore, monks lived in these woods over a thousand years ago. They practiced a form of large-scale permaculture before the word existed, cycling fish through ponds, using nutrient-rich water to grow food, and shaping the land with intention. There’s something deeply humbling about walking in their footsteps. About touching the same stones. About continuing the work, even if it’s under a different name now. Even though we’ve moved, we haven’t let go of everything. We’re keeping the Swiss garden alive, at least for now. Partly because it’s a beautiful place. But also because it allows us to compare, reflect, and learn. Two different climates. Two different soils. Two parallel experiments in regeneration. We’ll be watching how seeds grow here versus there. How medicinal herbs adapt. How fruit trees thrive. There’s something poetic about growing the same plant in two places and seeing how it expresses itself. This isn’t a holiday home. It’s not a side project. We moved. Fully. We left Switzerland. The old apartment where Sean grew up is gone. Our routines, our assumptions, even our habits are shifting in a massive way. This is our new base. Our family home. The place where we’ll raise our three son’s, host friends, plant trees, and slowly shape a life aligned with the values we’ve been cultivating for years: simplicity, regeneration, seasonal living, and community. More videos. More stories. More learning. We’ll be sharing the big changes, like when we build the food forest or install the animal systems. But we’ll also share the small ones, like when we transplant wild raspberries, or we spot a deer at dusk, or the misty land in the morning cold. If there’s anything you’re curious about, just ask. If you know a plant we don’t, tell us. If you’ve made a similar move, we’d love to hear your story. Thank you for being here. Truly. This move was years in the making. It took courage, risk, and a lot of trust. But now that we’re here, with the soil beneath our feet and the stars above us, we know we made the right choice. We’re not just gardening anymore.
We’re tending a way of life. — And most of all, tell us what you’d love to see next. We’re listening.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Natural cleaning products are advertised everywhere, but are they worth it? Before I ever lived in the countryside or studied permaculture, I worked as a house cleaner. And even back then, I chose to use only natural cleaning products, partly because they were gentle, partly because I knew that was a great selling point for my clients. But it wasn’t until I trained as a holistic health practictioner that I began to fully understand the deeper cost of conventional cleaning chemicals, their impact on our hormones, our lungs, our microbiome, and the long-term health of our families. Cleaning, for me, isn’t just about tidying the surfaces of a home. It’s an energetic act. A way to tend to the spaces that support us, without harming the systems that sustain life. That’s why I made the switch. Over time, I’ve found simple, natural products that not only clean beautifully but also align with the values I want to live by. Below, I’m sharing my favorites, how I use them, what they do best, and how they tie into a permaculture lifestyle. You’ve probably seen the headlines that chemical cleaners can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), irritate the skin and respiratory system, and pollute waterways. But the impacts go deeper: Most conventional cleaners include synthetic fragrances, endocrine disruptors, and ingredients that are toxic when inhaled or absorbed (it takes roughly  seconds for these chemicals to absorb through your skin!). These compounds accumulate over time, particularly in small or poorly ventilated homes. Chemical-based cleaning agents don’t just vanish down the drain. They enter greywater systems, disrupt aquatic ecosystems, and are often packaged in single-use plastics. Natural cleaners, by contrast, are simple, accessible, and often multipurpose. And most importantly, they work. Here’s what’s always in my cupboard, plus a few personal tips on how I use them. A thick, olive-based soap paste or liquid that’s as gentle as it is powerful. Uses: Tip: I mix a teaspoon of savon noir with warm water and spray it on aphids in the garden. It’s a natural insecticide that doesn’t harm beneficial bugs when used sparingly. This powder releases oxygen when mixed with warm water, like hydrogen peroxide, but dry. Uses: Tip: Pour a tablespoon into the kitchen sink drain, add hot water, and wait. It’s excellent at breaking down grease and organic build-up, without toxic fumes. The ultimate multipurpose scrub and deodorizer. Uses: Tip: Mix it with a few drops of essential oil and store it in a jar to make a gentle scouring powder. Acidic, antibacterial, and endlessly useful (except on marble or granite). Uses: Tip: I pour it into a spray bottle with orange peels and let it infuse for two weeks. It smells wonderful and works beautifully on countertops. Naturally antiseptic and brightening. Uses: Tip: Half a lemon dipped in salt makes a great natural scrubber for soap scum or mineral deposits. Citrus essential oils (like orange, lemon, or grapefruit) are uplifting, antibacterial, and dissolve grease. Uses: Tip: Save all your citrus peels in a jar, cover them with vinegar, and leave it to infuse for – weeks. Strain and dilute for a citrus-scented all-purpose spray. Add a therapeutic, antimicrobial edge to your cleaning. Just a few drops go a long way. Uses: Tip: Add a few drops of lavender oil to baking soda and sprinkle on rugs before vacuuming. A ready-made paste of natural abrasives, ideal for tougher jobs. Uses: Tip: A little goes a long way. Let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing for best results. Traditional hard soap made from olive oil, gentle and biodegradable. Uses: Derived from citrus fruit, an excellent natural descaler. Uses: Stronger than baking soda, better for heavy-duty cleaning. Uses: If you’re just starting out, you don’t need to buy everything at once. Most natural cleaning routines can begin with just a few basic ingredients. Here’s what I recommend for your starter kit: You can do a lot with these: laundry, surface cleaning, drain unclogging, stain removal, and even garden maintenance. The more you experiment, the more confident and creative you’ll become. Living in alignment with permaculture practices isn’t just about how we grow our food; it’s about how we care for our spaces, our bodies, and our communities. Cleaning might seem like a small thing, but it touches every part of our daily lives. Here’s how natural cleaning ties into the core permaculture ethics: Choosing biodegradable, plant-based cleaners protects the water, soil, and air from synthetic pollution. It also helps reduce packaging waste. Many natural products can be bought in bulk, or even made from scraps. Natural cleaners are safer for children, pets, and anyone with sensitivities. They support healthier homes by reducing toxic load, hormone disruptors, and allergens. These products are usually more affordable in the long run and reduce dependency on corporations or plastic-heavy supply chains. DIY cleaners also promote resourcefulness and community sharing. Swap recipes, buy ingredients together, or share what works with your neighbors. One of my favorite things about natural cleaning is how often the “waste” becomes a resource. Citrus peels become infused vinegar. Old t-shirts become rags. Ashes from the stove can scrub glass. It’s a beautiful loop. Switching to natural cleaning products isn’t just a sustainability hack; it’s a mindset shift. It’s about moving from convenience to consciousness, from overconsumption to sufficiency. You don’t have to be perfect. Just start with one swap. Maybe vinegar instead of a spray bottle full of mystery chemicals. Baking soda under the sink instead of bleach. A little jar of orange peel cleaner that reminds you of the seasons and the land you live on. Cleaning this way feels good. Not just because my home is fresh and sparkling, but because it feels aligned. Aligned with my health, the earth, and the kind of future I want to help build. Have you tried any of these natural cleaning product swaps? Do you have a favorite DIY recipe? I’d love to hear about your experience, what’s worked, what hasn’t, and what surprised you. And if you’re just getting started: welcome. You’re not alone. This is one small, powerful step toward living in harmony with the earth, and I’m so glad you’re taking it.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Walk past a garden border and you might spot them – slender green spikes that look a bit like grass until you look closer. Chives are easy to overlook, yet these modest onion family members have been quietly useful in gardens and kitchens for centuries. They’re the perfect starter herb for beginners, while still earning their keep in the gardens of green-thumbed experts. Botanically speaking, chives (Allium schoenoprasum) are related to onions, garlic, leeks, and scallions in the Amaryllidaceae family. “Allium” comes from the Latin for garlic, while “schoenoprasum” combines Greek words for “rush” and “leek” – basically “reed-like leek,” which makes sense when you see them growing. Unlike their stronger-flavored cousins, chives won’t make you cry or leave your breath reeking. They have hollow, tubular leaves that grow - inches tall in dense clumps. Around early summer, they send up slightly taller stalks with round purple flower heads. These pom-pom blooms are both exceedingly pretty and edible, with a stronger onion punch than the leaves. Bees love them as well. Chives don’t have the dramatic history of some herbs (nobody started wars over chives), but they’ve been useful kitchen companions across the Northern Hemisphere for thousands of years. They grow wild in Europe, Asia, and North America, often in damp meadows and near streams. The Romans probably brought cultivated chives to Britain, using them for cooking and medicine. Marco Polo mentioned finding them widely used across China during his travels. He apparently brought some Asian varieties back to Europe, though probably not with the fanfare of his other discoveries. Medieval monks grew chives in their gardens, valuing them both as food flavoring and medicine. Hildegard of Bingen, a pretty remarkable th-century abbess and herbalist, wrote that chives helped digestion and circulation – uses that modern research hasn’t completely dismissed. One strange bit of history comes from Romania, where they were hung in houses alongside garlic to ward off vampires. More practically, Dutch dairy farmers noticed that cows grazing on pastures with wild chives produced better-tasting milk, so they started deliberately planting them in their fields. In Swedish folk medicine, bunches of chives were hung around homes during illness, supposedly to prevent disease from spreading. Seems odd now, but the antimicrobial compounds in alliums might actually have helped a bit in crowded living conditions. Chives are remarkably low-maintenance plants that thrive across much of the Northern Hemisphere. Unlike fussier Mediterranean herbs that need hot, dry conditions, chives handle cool weather and cold winters without complaint. They’re often among the first herbs to pop up in spring, sometimes even pushing through late snow. They grow best in fairly rich, well-drained soil that stays consistently moist but not waterlogged. Full sun works in cooler climates, but they appreciate afternoon shade in hotter regions. Once established, they’re surprisingly drought-tolerant, though they’ll look prettier with regular water. Most commercial chives come from China, Japan, and parts of Europe, but they’re more commonly grown in home gardens than as major agricultural crops. Their short shelf life after cutting means locally-grown chives are usually best for cooking. What makes chives particularly good for home gardens is their perennial nature and compact growth habit. A single planting can produce harvests for many years, slowly expanding into larger clumps that can be divided and replanted. They don’t take up much space and work well in containers, too. Chives might not be medical powerhouses like garlic, but they pack surprising benefits into those slender leaves: In Russia, mothers would hang bunches of chives over a sick child’s bed to help with colds and respiratory infections. While this might sound like pure superstition, the volatile compounds released might have helped clear congestion somewhat, like a very mild natural vapor rub. Though less myth-laden than some herbs, chives have collected their fair share of folk beliefs and superstitions. In parts of Eastern Europe, people planted chives on graves to keep evil spirits away from the deceased. More likely, the smell deterred scavenging animals, but the spiritual protection story probably sounded better. Chinese tradition held that giving someone chives as a gift symbolized long life and endurance – logical when you consider how stubbornly perennial these plants are. They come back year after year without much fuss. European farmers sometimes hung bunches of chives in cow stalls when animals were sick. While they explained this as driving away evil spirits causing illness, the strong smell might have actually helped repel certain insects or parasites. One particularly odd belief from Eastern Europe warned that pregnant women shouldn’t cut chives because it could cause their baby to be born with a cleft palate. This superstition probably arose because chive leaves themselves are hollow and split – a classic case of sympathetic magic where like supposedly affects like. Swiss Alpine shepherds sometimes decorated their lead cow with a garland including chives during the ceremonial autumn descent from mountain pastures. This celebrated the herbs that had supposedly improved their milk throughout the summer grazing season. For beginning gardeners, chives are about as fool-proof as herbs get. Here’s how to succeed with minimal effort: Start with seeds, divisions, or small plants from a garden center. Seeds need to be started indoors about - weeks before the last frost, then transplanted outside once established. Divisions from existing plants establish quickly and give you harvestable leaves much faster. Plant them in soil with some compost mixed in, spacing plants about - inches apart. Water regularly until established. They like consistent moisture but won’t immediately die if you forget to water occasionally. Don’t overfertilize – too much nitrogen makes for floppy, weak growth. A light application of balanced fertilizer in spring is plenty. Harvest by cutting leaves about  inches above the soil line using scissors. This encourages fresh growth and prevents woody stems. Regular cutting keeps plants productive, but avoid taking more than a third of a plant at once. Every - years, divide established clumps in early spring or fall. This rejuvenates the plants, prevents overcrowding, and gives you more chives to plant elsewhere or share with neighbors. Consider growing both regular chives and garlic chives (Allium tuberosum). The latter have flat leaves instead of round ones, a mild garlic flavor, and pretty white flowers that bloom later in summer than regular chives do. Beyond sprinkling them on potatoes, this herb has several practical uses: Nothing about chives screams for attention. They’re not flashy, exotic, or trendy. But their steady presence in gardens across the Northern Hemisphere speaks to their genuine usefulness. What makes chives worth growing? They don’t need coddling or special treatment. They grow happily in average soil with moderate water. They survive winter freezes that kill other herbs. They deter some garden pests while attracting beneficial insects. And they provide fresh flavor for most of the growing season, often starting earlier than other herbs in spring. These modest plants connect modern gardeners to centuries of herbal tradition while requiring almost no special knowledge to grow successfully. Sometimes the most valuable additions to our gardens aren’t the showiest or most exotic, but the quietly reliable ones that simply do their jobs without demanding much in return. Chives and green onions (also called scallions) are both alliums with a mild onion flavor, but they differ in appearance, texture, and culinary use. Chives are thin, hollow, grass-like herbs typically used as a garnish; their flavor is delicate and best enjoyed raw. Green onions, on the other hand, have a white bulb and green stalks, both of which are edible and often used in cooking. They offer a stronger, more onion-like taste and hold up better to heat, making them more versatile in sautés, stir-fries, and soups.";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
We have been growing thyme in our gardens and kitchens for thousands of years. This humble herb might not grab attention like flashy basil or towering rosemary, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in staying power. Walk through any herb garden, and you’ll likely find thyme tucked somewhere, often spilling over the edges of paths, releasing its distinctive scent when stepped on. Thyme belongs to the mint family, with common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) being the variety most often found in gardens and kitchens. Its name comes from the Greek word “thymos,” which means courage or strength – fitting for a plant that survives in some pretty harsh conditions. With tiny, oval leaves growing on woody stems and small purple, pink, or white flowers, thyme might look delicate, but don’t be fooled – this herb is tough as nails. The fragrance of thyme is unique – woody, slightly floral, with hints of lemon, pepper, and something distinctly earthy. Crush a leaf between your fingers, and you’ll understand why this herb has captivated cooks and healers for centuries. Thyme’s relationship with humans stretches back to ancient Egypt, where it was used in embalming rituals. The Egyptians believed its aromatic properties would help the spirit on its journey to the afterlife. No pressure, little herb. The ancient Greeks burned thyme as incense in their temples, believing its smoke purified the space. Greek soldiers bathed in thyme-infused water before battle, supposedly to infuse themselves with courage and vigor. This association with bravery continued with the Romans, who offered thyme to those going into battle. In medieval Europe, thyme took on new significance. Ladies embroidered thyme sprigs on scarves for their knights heading to the Crusades as symbols of courage. Thyme also gained a reputation for warding off nightmares when placed under pillows – a practice that persisted for centuries. One particularly interesting chapter in thyme’s history involves the Black Death. During this devastating plague, people would carry posies containing thyme and other strong-smelling herbs, believing they provided protection against the disease. Modern science has since shown that thyme does indeed have powerful antiseptic properties – those medieval folks were onto something. The th-century English herbalist Nicholas Culpeper wrote that thyme was “a noble strengthener of the lungs” – another traditional use that modern research has partly validated, as thyme can help with respiratory conditions. Thyme is native to the Mediterranean region, which explains why it loves the sun and hates soggy soil. Take a hike through the hills of Greece or southern France and you’ll spot thyme tucked between rocks, growing happily in places that would kill most garden plants. Today, thyme grows throughout Europe, North Africa, Asia, and North America, having been spread by centuries of human cultivation. It’s adapted to a surprising range of climates, though it generally prefers hot, sunny positions and well-drained soil. In gardens, thyme often finds a home in rock gardens, between paving stones, or as a low-growing ground cover. Some varieties even substitute for lawn grass in low-traffic areas, creating a fragrant carpet that releases its scent when walked upon. The plant’s natural habitat explains its growing preferences: thyme absolutely hates wet feet. Plant it in waterlogged soil, and it will quickly rot. But give it some sandy or gravelly soil and plenty of sun, and it will reward you with years of growth from a single planting. People have been using thyme to treat various ailments for centuries, long before anyone understood why it worked. Modern research has finally caught up with what our ancestors somehow figured out through trial and error. The secret behind thyme’s medicinal power is its essential oil, especially a compound called thymol. Here’s what traditional healers used thyme for: I’ve tried making thyme steam for stuffy sinuses (just put fresh thyme in a bowl of hot water and breathe in the steam), and while I can’t prove anything scientifically, it definitely made breathing easier! Being an ancient and widespread herb, thyme has gathered its share of curious beliefs and superstitions. In European folklore, thyme was thought to attract fairies to gardens. Some claimed that patches of wild thyme marked places where fairies danced under the full moon. This association led to the planting of thyme in gardens not just for practical purposes but as an invitation to beneficial fairy folk. Scottish highlanders brewed a tea of wild thyme to provide “second sight” or prophetic visions – a practice that probably had more to do with thyme’s mild mood-altering properties than actual clairvoyance. In some parts of England, it was believed that a patch of wild thyme growing on a hillside indicated buried treasure beneath – perhaps because the plant often grows on rocky, mineral-rich soil that might contain ore deposits. Many cultures associated thyme with transitions and passages. In addition to its role in Egyptian funerary practices, some European traditions included placing sprigs of thyme in coffins to assure a safe passage to the afterlife. More happily, thyme was also incorporated into wedding bouquets and decorations to ensure courage and strength in the marriage. Thyme ranks among the easiest herbs to grow, making it perfect for beginning gardeners. It asks little and gives much in return. Starting thyme from seed requires patience, as germination can be slow and somewhat unpredictable. Most gardeners start with small plants purchased from nurseries or cuttings from established plants, which root readily in moist soil. The key to growing thyme successfully lies in mimicking its natural Mediterranean habitat: full sun, excellent drainage, and not too much fertilizer or water. In fact, thyme develops more intense flavor when grown in somewhat poor soil and allowed to dry out between waterings. In colder regions, thyme may die back in winter but usually recovers in spring. After several years, plants often become woody and less productive, at which point it’s best to replace them with fresh ones. Harvest thyme just before it flowers for the most concentrated flavor. Morning harvesting, after the dew has dried but before the day heats up, captures the highest concentration of essential oils. While we now know thyme primarily as a culinary herb, its uses extend far beyond the kitchen: From ancient Egyptian tombs to modern kitchen gardens, thyme has proven itself one of our most enduring herbal companions. Its stubborn ability to thrive in tough conditions mirrors the resilience it brings to those who use it – whether as food, medicine, or simple garden beauty. Something about thyme’s subtle, complex fragrance continues to draw us back, generation after generation. Perhaps it’s the way it connects us to our ancestors, who gathered wild thyme from Mediterranean hillsides and discovered its remarkable properties through centuries of use. Small as it is, thyme reminds us that sometimes the most unassuming plants carry the most profound gifts. The next time you brush past it in a garden or sprinkle it into a soup, remember you’re participating in a human tradition spanning thousands of years and countless cultures – all centered around a tiny herb with outsized importance.;Jardin Feuilles de Vie
Stroll through any garden, and you might be lucky to spot calendula officinalis — with its vibrant orange and yellow petals radiating just like miniature suns. Often mistaken for the common marigold, this bright flower has been cherished for centuries for its powerful healing properties, culinary charm, and symbolic significance across cultures. Scientifically known as Calendula officinalis, this member of the daisy family has been called “pot marigold,” “Mary’s gold,” and “Herb of the Sun,” among other names. But no matter what you call it, calendula’s legacy is deeply rooted in both modern herbalism and folk traditions. With its bright blossoms, slightly sticky stems, and long blooming season, calendula brings color and purpose to gardens and in the kitchen from early spring to the first frost — a true ally for both body and soul.  Calendula has a rich history that glows as bright as its petals. Ancient Egyptians valued calendula for its rejuvenating properties, using it in skin treatments and religious ceremonies. In Greek and Roman times, it adorned crowns, altars, and feasts, often associated with sun deities and festivals. Medieval European herbalists turned to calendula for everything from healing wounds to protecting against the plague. Its presence in church gardens and apothecaries was so widespread that it became known as the “herb of the sun,” believed to chase away darkness — both literal and metaphorical.  Calendula is a beloved edible flower of the kitchen. Chefs add its petals to soups, stews, and salads — hence the nickname “pot marigold” — for both color and a subtle peppery flavor. In times when saffron was far too expensive, calendula stood in as a worthy replacement. Folklore tells of using calendula in love potions, dreaming of one’s true love by placing petals under the pillow, and even divining the weather by watching whether its blossoms opened in the morning. If calendula failed to bloom, rain was on the way — an herbal barometer in bloom. Calendula originally hailed from southern Europe and the Mediterranean, but its adaptability has allowed it to travel far beyond its native region. It now thrives in gardens and meadows across North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. Unlike many delicate flowers, calendula prefers a bit of roughness. It grows best in average soil, full sun, and with minimal watering. In fact, too much pampering can lead to fewer blooms. Like many of the best things in life, calendula blooms brightest when left a little to its wild nature. Thanks to its long flowering season and ability to self-seed, calendula can feel almost eternal in the garden. One well-placed patch will usually return again and again — a perennial in spirit and by definition. Calendula’s healing gifts are abundant. Herbalists across the world have long turned to this plant for skin care, wound healing, and to help reduce inflammation — and modern science is catching up. Remarkably, calendula’s healing reputation spans the globe — from Ayurveda to European folk medicine, echoing a universal recognition of its gentle, effective powers. More than just medicine, calendula officinalis is steeped in symbolism and sacred meaning. In Christian folklore, calendula was associated with the Virgin Mary, often used to decorate altars and referred to as “Mary’s gold.” It became a flower of devotion and purity, appearing in religious paintings and sacred gardens. In Mexico, calendula (or a closely related variety) plays a central role in Día de los Muertos celebrations, believed to guide the spirits of the dead back to their families with its bright color and strong scent. It’s a flower of memory, of grief, and of connection between the worlds. In old European lore, calendula was considered protective — planted near homes to ward off evil, added to love charms to draw affection, and brewed in teas to bring visions or prophetic dreams. It was a flower of both magic and medicine. Calendula may just be one of the easiest and most rewarding herbs to grow at home. Sow seeds directly in the garden after the last frost, or start indoors a few weeks earlier. Calendula loves full sun and will bloom steadily until the first hard frost. Deadheading (removing spent flowers) encourages even more blooms, and its generous nature means you’ll have plenty to share. Even in pots or balcony planters, calendula does well — just make sure it gets at least  hours of sun per day and drains well. Once it’s established, calendula is fairly drought-resistant and requires little care. To harvest, pick the fully opened flowers in the morning once the dew has dried. Dry them in a warm, dark place and store them in airtight containers for use throughout the year. Calendula’s gifts go far beyond beauty and medicine. Here are a few simple ways to bring its sunshine into your daily life: From ancient rituals to modern remedies, calendula continues to shine as a botanical treasure. Its petals hold centuries of wisdom, yet its lessons remain timeless: Healing can be gentle, beauty can be practical, and some of the most powerful medicines bloom quietly beneath our feet. Whether you grow it, sip it, or simply admire it, calendula offers a radiant reminder of nature’s generosity — one sunny flower at a time. Calendula (Calendula officinalis) is often called “pot marigold,” but it is different from the ornamental marigold (Tagetes species) commonly seen in flower beds. Yes! Calendula is gentle and often used to soothe eczema, diaper rash, and irritated or dry skin. Dry the petals, infuse them in a carrier oil like olive or jojoba for – weeks, then strain and store in a dark glass container.;Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"Creating a herbarium is a powerful way to connect with nature, document plant diversity, and gain a hands-on understanding of your local ecosystem. Traditionally, herbariums are collections of preserved plant specimens, carefully pressed and labeled to capture a wide array of botanical details. These collections have played an essential role in botany and plant science for centuries, enabling researchers to study plant species, track environmental changes, and preserve information about the natural world. But a herbarium isn’t just for scientists.

For nature enthusiasts, hobbyists, and even students, a personal herbarium is an invitation to learn more about the plants around them, whether it’s in the backyard, a nearby park, or an open field. I was inspired to create my own herbarium when I started diving into herbalism and permaculture. I realized that to truly understand plants, I needed a resource that combined both identification and practical uses in one place—a guidebook that could evolve over time and help me not only recognize plants but also understand how to use them for culinary and medicinal benefits. In this blog, I’ll share how to get started with your own herbarium, bringing together the worlds of botany and practical plant knowledge. For me, creating a herbarium was a way to document and explore the local edible plants, including some plants we would consider weeds! I loved the idea of capturing not only the plant’s physical traits but also noting where I found it, the season, and what other culinary or medicinal uses it might have. This practice deepened my understanding of each species and its role in the environment. Each specimen I gathered would usually include specific details about the plant, such as its: A herbarium can be as simple or as detailed as you like, making it a valuable resource for anyone passionate about the natural world. As I started building my herbarium, I wanted to combine botanical information with practical uses, creating a guide that was both a herbarium and a materia medica. Here’s how these two approaches differ: Combining these elements in my herbarium gave me a more comprehensive view: not only did I learn to identify plants, but I also began to understand their roles in herbalism, permaculture, and even in my kitchen. I’ve always been drawn to understanding the plants around me, but creating a herbarium gave me a way to dive deeper into local ecosystems and the diversity found there. With a herbarium, I felt more empowered to learn and document without needing a formal biology or science background. There are different ways to create a herbarium, each with its own advantages depending on your interests and needs. To start, decide what you want your herbarium to focus on. It could be backyard forageables, medicinal plants, or even seasonal blooms. Having a theme can make your herbarium more cohesive and give you a clear idea of what plants to look for. Included in my herbarium, I list out the following: When collecting plants, be mindful of the environment. Avoid overharvesting and try to gather only from sustainable areas. Note the habitat and other details so you can accurately document your specimen. Start by choosing healthy, fresh specimens. Place each plant between sheets of absorbent paper to prevent moisture from damaging it. Stack these within a plant press or heavy books, checking every few days and replacing the paper to avoid mold. In two to three weeks, your plant will be fully pressed and ready to store. Drying times depend on the plant’s moisture content and thickness. Typically, two to four weeks is sufficient for most plants. Keep the press in a warm, dry space to speed up the process, and avoid microwave techniques if you want to preserve natural colors. Choose vibrant, healthy specimens to help retain color. Use acid-free paper to prevent yellowing and avoid direct sunlight while drying. For long-term storage, a cool, dry place works best, and UV-resistant spray can help preserve colors. Labeling is essential to keeping your herbarium organized. Include details like the plant’s common and botanical names, location, date of collection, and habitat notes. Get creative with your labels—add sketches, use natural ink, or try botanical names for an extra educational touch. Each season brings its own unique plants to discover. In spring, look for early blooms like violets and dandelions. Summer offers herbs like mint and yarrow, while autumn brings plants like goldenrod and sage. Adding seasonal plants not only diversifies your collection but helps you learn the rhythms of nature. Before foraging, research local regulations to ensure you’re gathering plants legally and ethically. Some common, safe-to-forage plants include dandelions, nettles, and clover. Always be mindful of protected species, and remember to harvest sustainably. Creating a personal herbarium is a journey that deepens your connection to nature, allowing you to learn, explore, and document the world around you. Whether for personal enrichment, practical uses, or sharing knowledge with family and friends, a herbarium is a rewarding project that you can continue to build over time. Start your own herbarium today and let it become a cherished resource for you and future generations. ";Jardin Feuilles de Vie
"It doesn’t need to be a big campfire, if that’s not where you’re at, this season. It can be just a few sticks. That’s fine. Solstice campfires take many forms. Down to the beach, firewood in hand. To make a fire. To sing the shortest day of the year down, through the setting sun, down into the night. Baskets full of wrapped-up dinner, rugs, mugs, lots of warm clothes. Clinking bags of drinks that were made months ago – in the autumn warmth and harvest, with this solstice evening in mind. This is something that we ‘just do’, now. It is a marker of the year. Fire stacked and lit as the sun goes down, behind the hills on the other side of the river. The crackling of firelight – small at first – as we all unpack our various treats, spread out rugs, offer up a mug to whoever is keen to pour something into it. Some contemplate a sunset swim, some poke pre-baked potatoes into the edges of the fire to re-heat. Some folks just sit on a log, cupping a steaming mug of ginger tea, staring out over the river – considering the year that has been. And the black swans, flying low over the water, heading home. Here we are, back again. At the turning of the year. Fair enough to ask this, I think. Our current western culture doesn’t exactly centre festivals or celebrations that are defined by the actual Earth (and the Sun, in this case)… so. Time to step outside the Gregorian calendar, for a change. It’s good practice, for us all. Every place on Earth gets  solstices per solar year – summer and winter solstice – because of the tilt of the Earth and how it moves around the sun. Saturday June st marks the next solar solstice. If you’re in the Southern Hemisphere, this is the winter solstice – the shortest day and longest night of the solar year. The sun will rise at it’s most northern point in the sky, skim the northern horizon in it’s lowest arc of the year, and set in the west (or north-west, depending how south you are) in the mid-afternoon, beginning the longest night. If you’re in the Northern Hemisphere, this same day is the summer solstice – the shortest night and the longest day, with the sun reaching its highest point in the sky for the year at midday. A carefully-tended campfire is still recommended, as are friends and delicious treats, but hopefully you’ll need less warm clothes! Give yourself permission to pause, though. “The times are urgent, let us slow down” councils Bayo Akomolafe… “… slowing down is not a function of privilege. It is a function of intimacy with a world that is agentially alive…“ Make your own rituals wherever you can. Sit with the seasons. Sit with each other, and yourself, and the sunset. An invitation to come together over simple celebrations, in a common space. Evenings like a solstice campfire can be the best medicine there is. Washed down with warm tea, looking around the fire at the other shining faces, flickering in the light. Each thinking their own mid-winter thoughts. Here, together, in between the everything of our current world. You can also do this solstice ritual alone, if you like, to bring yourself back together, first. A party of one is an excellent beginning. Once, many years ago, I made my own little solstice fire in a laneway in inner-city Sydney. It only burned for a moment or two – cardboard, and a few sticks of chipboard from a thrown-out something. But I lit that fire all the same, and I sat, as the light faded through the tangle of overhead railway wires. And although I could not see the moon when I looked up that night, between the silos and the buildings, I knew it was there. So I can confirm that this solstice practice can be done prettymuch anywhere. Even just for a moment or two – with care, and attention, and perhaps a little cardboard. Marking the solstice is a bit like the practice of active hope. Just as active hope doesn’t require you to feel happy, or even especially hopeful, to begin to cultivate it, so too can this solstice observance. You can feel entirely rotten about the situation. As I did that time in the city. And yet. Make the fire, sit with it a moment, and just be there. And there you are. We mark the four quarters of the solar year, now, on this beach. Unless we’re setting a little fire on another beach, or forest, or down by the creek. Wherever works for the folks involved. Sometimes with two people. Sometimes with great crowds of folks. Whatever the season brings is perfect. I’ve often thought of these events as participating in an earth-bound constellation, of sorts. All our little campfires, all those points of light, creating a twinkling of stars, when seen from above. Wider than a valley. Perhaps across a whole continent. All softly marking the moment. Acknowledging the turning of the year. A simple, but powerful, way to be our selves, together – in this ecosystem, within this place, at this time on Earth. So – that is the love part of this season. We each are capable of many actions in a season, as well as sitting around a fire on solstice. We have room for many things, in our hearts. We can hold them all. So here’s some suggestions for this month – to consider, support, learn, and do: The most important thing about a solstice fire is that you get your body there, to the place, to the fire, with enough warm clothes. That’s the central thing. The food, though delicious and and a good companion, is secondary, and should be whatever you can manage, that day, this season. Home-made everything (while lovely) is not required. Heck I don’t care if you bring KFC. Or nothing at all. Just come. And sit. And be here with us. Below are a few ‘here’s how we do it‘ suggestions for dependable, easy, cheap, portable and delicious campfire feasting. All tried and tested. Firstly, a shoutout to the Upside down fire technique. It looks weird. But it works SO well. (Also known as the Minecraft Fire Technique, by some of the smaller folks we tend to sit with). Pre-bake your potatoes whole in the oven, scrubbed clean but skins on, earlier that day. Putting them all in a dutch oven or similar container inside the oven with a big splash of water can speed up the process, if you need. Microwaves might be great too, for this job? Take them out, and let them cool a bit. You can wrap them in foil (or banana leaf)at this point, if you like, or they can just go in the campfire as-is, with their skins. Chuck them in a basket with a container of garlic butter, some chopped herbs, and sour cream if you like. Or whatever floats your baked potato boat. Also salt and pepper. Later, when you’ve made the fire, poke the potatoes in around the edges of the coals. They will be ready when you are hungry. Poke one with a knife if you want to check, and feel how hot the knife blade is when you pull it out.

Once they’re ready (or you’re hungry) – roll the potatoes out of the fire, let them cool a bit, wipe down w a tea towel to get the ash and sand off them. Then, take your baked potato, in a bowl of a big mug or whatever you have, slice a big cross into the top of it with a sharp knife, and add your toppings to it’s steaming innards. Eating with a spoon is a good strategy. And a note that most of the stages of this recipe can be done in the near-dark, and it all still works out. Delicious, but requiring a bit more prep that potatoes. Either make the dumplings (or wontons, really – thanks Nagi for this recipe!) beforehand, or bring a bowl of dumpling-innards (whatever combo you like) and a bunch of dumpling skins down to the campfire, and make them onsite. Boil up a pot of water over the fire – if you’re at the beach, you can use half-fresh-half-sea water. Once it’s simmering, add a few dumplings and watch while they cook. Scoop out (a slotted spoon is a good companion here) into a nearby bowl, dress in chili oil or whatever you like, and watch them all disappear into delighted mouths, as fast as you can make them. What it sounds like! L of apple juice, L water, spices of your choice and some slices of orange. Heat. Pre-make and bring in a big thermos if you like, or just bring all the bits (and a ladel) and make this on the fire. Add more apple juice as more folks show up. Also works quite well with an added nip of whatever you like. Apple brandy is a fave. Either pre-made in a big batch at home and re-toasted on a stick, or made onsite. Cheese, onion and chive are a fave waffle combo for us, also great for dipping in soup. Here’s a basic recipe. Anything that you might normally make in a pie shape can be made in a long roll shape, then cut up into bits. Hand food is good. This is not a recipe, but I’m sure you can look up something simple to do from here. We use this kinda basic Toffee Apple recipe, and make them on the fire after dinner. You’ll need a head torch to tell when the toffee is ready. Everyone that wants a toffee apple has to go find their own stick first, then add the apple to the stick. A caution that once dipped, the apples will be HOT and toffee can burn you. So once you have your toffee-d apple on your stick, point it away from all other humans, wave it around a bit to cool it down, and sing something with at least three verses plus choruses (bridge optional) before you touch your toffee apple – and even then, start with your fingertips, not your lip. This is a polish vodka ‘medicine’ that I’ve started making in autumn. It involves a few steps, but I think it’s worth it – both for the medicinal qualities, and also to store the season and bring it back around, in the middle of winter. You end up with a thick-ish liquid that tastes like sunlight, rosehips, and leatherwood honey. Here’s the recipe. A good way to toast the new year. Good fire stewardship is always essential. Choose a spot for your little fire that won’t impact the place around it in any negative way. Bring your own wood. Flowers are always welcome, with whatever vegetal bits and pieces speak to the season, for you. And no matter where you make this fire (even if it’s super remote)…. put the fire out when you leave. Like, completely. Go scoop up thermos’s of water from the bay, or the creek, or use the last of your soup if you have to, to completely douse the fire. By observing good fire stewardship, you’re ensuring that no being is harmed by an unexpected hot patch on the ground (human, bandicoot, etc), and that no sneaky sparks or embers can take flight after you’re gone. This act of care closes the space, shows respect for the place, and is an essential part of the whole. If you don’t have the beans / spoons / energy for all this hoo-ha at solstice, sometimes that’s the way it is. Care and rest and strength to you. But not every solstice fire needs to be big. Or even a fire. A candle is very much a point of light. And a welcome addition to the earth-bound constellation, that we may all make this solstice season. Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can. And remember – whatever you’ve got to offer is heaps. More than enough. So just work with that. Good solstice, and warm toes, to you and yours x A big thanks to all the lovely folks we’ve ever solstice-ed with, on beaches and riverbanks, in glades and loungerooms, and even high up on a rocky hill, once. To more of the same, please. Extra thanks to Michelle Crawford for the pic of the toffee-apple making, and to Josie Harmor who first showed us that of course you can make toffee in the dark, on the dying embers of a fire! And also to Maria, who first brought the flowers to lay around the fire, years ago now. May we never be without them again.      ";Milkwood
"Making a mushroom spore print is an excellent way to get to know mushrooms a little better.  And as a bonus, Mushroom Spore Prints make beautiful artworks, and are also a great way to learn to ID different mushroom species. So whether you’re after a forest-meets-craft project, or determined to ID your local mushrooms to get to know them better, Spore Prints are fun, easy and a great way to do both, at once. Have you ever held a mushroom in your hand and wondered at the many mysteries it holds? Beyond their taste, their texture, and their place in our gardens, ecosystems and dinner plates, mushrooms carry within them billions of tiny worlds – spores – ready to burst forth and begin again. There’s a simple and beautiful practice you can do right now, to start getting to know mushrooms a little better… make a spore print! Here’s a snip of a lesson from our Home Mushroom Cultivation course – which covers all kinds of mushroom growing from buckets to logs to gardens. In this lesson, Nick is talking about spawn vs spores. And as part of that, he shares how to make a spore print: If you’d like to learn more about growing mushrooms at home, we mentor a class of students through the whole process, each season. Here’s the course details: Home Mushroom Cultivation course. We cover all the home cultivation options, for both delicious and medicinal mushrooms, with low-waste techniques, and show you how to grow a year-round supply of mushrooms. Yay. We also have a free Beginner’s Guide to Mushroom Cultivation, and also a Free Mushrooms Mini-Course, if you’re keen to learn more. Ok. Let’s do some spore printing…  Before we begin, let’s pause to admire the form of this being in your hand. Not all mushrooms are constructed quite the same, but most of our everyday friends – shiitakes, oysters, your humble Swiss brown – share some familiar features. At the top, you’ll find the cap – wide and often rounded. Turn it over, and underneath you’ll see either gills or pores – delicate structures hiding billions of spores within. These spores are a little like the mushroom’s seeds (in a sense) though fungi do things in their own way… Supporting the cap is the stipe (that’s the stem). Some mushrooms have a ring, left behind by a thin veil that once covered the gills – like a tiny mushroom skirt from its early days. When selecting your mushroom, you can choose a fresh, store-bought one, or a mushroom that you pick from your local ecosystem.  We’ve added a note at the bottom of this article about mushroom safety and touching different species. Please read! If you’re the type of mycelium-lover who delights in names and shapes (we are!), there’s a downloadable Anatomy of a Mushroom Guide below these How-To steps, from inside our course, with all the bits labeled – including different cap shapes and gill styles. Here’s something magical: that mushroom you’re holding? It’s likely releasing thousands of microscopic spores into the air around you right now. We just can’t see them. Or… can we? Now to the hands-on part. To catch a glimpse of the hidden spore magic, we’ll make a print. Here’s how: There it is – your spore print. Intricate, symmetrical, impossibly fine. A tiny fungal mandala. Spore prints aren’t just beautiful – they’re clues. The colour of the spores can help you identify your mushroom. Some prints are white, some pink, others chocolate brown or even black. The gill colour doesn’t always match the spore colour, which is part of the surprise. While it’s unlikely this print could grow a new mushroom (it’s not the cleanest environment for spore germination), it is a wonderful way to learn, observe, and deepen your connection with fungi. If you’re doing this spore print to ID a new mushroom you’ve found, most Fungi Guides will include a note on each species spore print’s colour (see resources below for guide suggestions) This can be really helpful if you’re trying to narrow down a possible species, and get to know your ecosystem by learning to positively ID different mushrooms in your garden (and beyond!)  Want to keep your print? Let it dry completely, then fix it gently with a spray of artist’s fixative or a light mist of hairspray. Frame it, gift it, or tuck it between the pages of your nature journal. Don’t want to keep it? Spore prints are fine to add to your compost bin, or give it a quick wash under the tap, if it’s on foil or glass. Some folks use spore prints to cultivate mushrooms – and while this IS possible to do, it needs a completely sterile setting for that cultivation to be successful – something that a normal household is very unlikely to contain.  So go for it, try different species, learn lots, and don’t worry – the spore print won’t grow into mushrooms on your tabletop, we promise. Spore prints are one of those small, slow activities that bring you closer to the hidden workings of the world. They’re quiet little revelations, and all it takes is a mushroom, a bit of time, and your own curiosity. So next time you’re walking through the market or a mossy patch of forest, see if you can spot a cap just waiting to share its story… And then… let the spores fall where they may! There has been a lot of news lately about poisonous mushrooms in Australia and this, somewhat understandably, has led to a whole new wave of mycophobia.

However – good news, spore printers! – the medical and scientific consensus is clear… Mushroom poisoning can occur through ingestion (eating the Mushroom), but not from simply touching mushrooms. All authoritative sources define mushroom poisoning as resulting from consumption, and those sources that do directly address touching, confirm it is safe.

You can safely handle even the most poisonous mushrooms with your bare hands, but if you are concerned, wear gloves! Some people may be concerned about the exposure to mushroom spores. For most individuals, occasional exposure to mushroom spores when handling a few foraged mushrooms for spore prints presents minimal risk.  Research indicates that small amounts of spore exposure are generally harmless, while adverse reactions typically result from repeated or high-concentration exposure in poorly ventilated environments AKA factory mushroom farms. All that said, individual sensitivity varies significantly; some people may experience mild allergic reactions such as nasal congestion or sneezing, even with limited contact to some mushroom spores. Folks with pre-existing respiratory conditions, asthma, or known fungal allergies should exercise greater caution. So if this includes you – minimize any potential risk when making spore prints; work in a well-ventilated area (or do it all outside), consider wearing a mask if you have respiratory sensitivities, and wash your hands thoroughly afterward.  For safety, the most important precaution remains: never eat wild mushrooms unless identified with certainty. And very, very lastly – a note that we have all co-evolved with mushrooms and mycelium for millenia, and we’re all basically family, genetically speaking. So we encourage you to get to know mushrooms and fungi in your local ecosystem, in whatever way that looks like for you! Learning the ways of our fungi cousins will make your life so much richer, and bring you more into relationship with all the things that matter, on this planet, at this time on Earth x     ";Milkwood
This season I’ve been working on a progressive pickle process, because that’s how it needs to be done around here, if we want pickles aplenty come winter. Pickles – specifically, cucumber pickles – are very important in our house. They go with, and ontop of, many meals and snacks, and are a blessing in their own right. A good lacto-fermented dill pickle, fizzy, crunchy and full of summer-now-past, can make everything okay again. So dedicating a full garden bed to the summer crop of national pickler – Cucumis sativus, our pickle-specific cucumber of choice, was definitely a thing. National pickler cucumbers are small and spiky, though they can grow into enormous things if you miss them behind a particular leaf. They can be eaten fresh, but they often have a ‘chalky’ taste at that stage – which translates to a perfect, crunchy pickle later on, if that’s your plan. They are our first cucumbers to be ready in the garden each year. Climbing strong and high up whatever trellis we make for them, they need to be checked daily, once they’re fruiting, for cucumbers that are ready to pick. It’s a spiky business, the picking – but in the pursuit of the yearly supply of lacto-fermented dill pickles, I am here for it. In the last few years though, I’ve had to adapt my techniques from ‘here’s your kg of cucumbers all ready at once, go forth and pickle’ life to the some-times-one, sometimes-three daily pickle harvest. Tis the nature of growing outside in this climate, at º south, and also the nature of having a domestic-sized garden, rather than a small-farm-scale-pickle-situation, or access to wholesale city vegetable markets. Ideally, you’d start lacto-fermenting a big crock of cucumber pickles all at once – so they all go into the big crock together, they all ferment together, and then they all come out, to be packed into smaller jars for our fridge and for friends, when they’re ready. But all at once is not the way, in this garden. This extremely casual approach to ripening called for a different pickling process. An ‘as it comes’ vibe. An iterative fermentation. Horseradish and black currant leaves for tannin, plus wisps of dill and fennel for flavour. And cucumbers, of course. I can’t confirm if this process would work for all lacto-ferments, but it does work for National Pickler cucumbers. Very well. Basically this ‘progressive pickle’ is a process of making up a huge vat of pickle brine, then adding the cucumbers as they ripen, plop plop plop. This process seems to work best if: Get yourself a large fermentation crock, or bucket, and get it clean as a whistle. We use L clay fermentation crocks for this, but use whatever you have to work with – jars, buckets – even a big non-reactive cooking pot will do. My fave cucumber pickle method is the ‘sour pickle’ – introduced to me by the lovely Sandor Katz, when we brought him to Australia to do a round of fermentation workshops (god that was a fun time) back in the day. Gather your first few rounds of cucumbers, keeping them in the fridge until you have -ish to get started with. To keep the pickles crunchy, you need some tannin in the mix. Leaves with enough tannins to be helpful include grape vine leaves, horseradish leaves, black currant leaves, oak leaves, or a big pinch of green tea will do the trick also. Blackcurrant leaves are awesome for adding tannin to pickles – strangely, it’s only the black currants (as opposed to red and white) whose leaves are suitable, because of their high tannin content. I gather a big bunch of blackcurrant leaves, as they’re closest to hand, and source some local garlic to go in there too. Everything gets washed, then the tannin-rich leaves go in the bottom of the crock (a few big handfuls, don’t scrimp) followed by whole heads of garlic cut crossways. Wash your cucumbers and remove any evidence of the flower end. The more uniform in size you can pick the cukes, the better. If there’s a few big ones, throw them in anyway – they’ll just take a bit longer. Once the cucumbers are prepped, they go in ontop of the leaves, dill and garlic. Put some more tannin-y leaves ontop – these can really help keep everything submerged and in place, so the bigger the leaves, the better – I use horseradish leaves for the top layer for this reason. Next – important – put a weight on it all. An upside down plate works well (maybe two?), or a series of clean flat rocks with a cloth under them, or fermentation weights if you have them. Then, it’s brine time. Sandor says .% brine for sour dill pickles, and he knows things. So .% brine it is. I’d recommend against spoonfuls and floating eggs and all the very sort-of-accurate measures for how much salt to use. Accurate salt means good brine. And when you’ve spent  weeks stewarding your crock of baby pickle dreams – getting the brine wrong, and having the pickles be inedible, would be a sad thing. So. measuring time. A .% brine is made by adding g of salt to  litre of water. Pretty straightforward. Multiply as needed, for more litres. Use the best quality salt you can find – either rock or sea salt is fine – no caking agents or iodine, if you can manage it. Weigh up g, add it to a litre container, add a bit of hot water to dissolve the salt, then fill it up to the litre mark with cold water and stir until it’s all dissolved. Hooray for brine. Into the crock: Layer one is tannin-rich leaves, garlic, dill and fennel. Layer two is the cucumbers, all snugged in. In a progressive pickle, I’ve found the best way is to add at least half the brine, at the beginning of the process. This means that the first cucumbers added ferment more slowly (due to all that salty brine) and then as you keep adding cukes, the brine-to-pickle ratio evens up somewhat, and the lacto-bacillius really brew up and do their fermenty thing – which means the later-added cucumbers ferment a bit faster. It evens out pretty well, by the end. So for a L crock, I’ll make up L of .% brine, and pour that over the little arrangement of cucumbers way down on the bottom – who are covered by leaves, and their weight. And then tomorrow, or the next day, as I pick a few more cucumbers, in they go – washed and ready to join the pickle party. If I’m just adding a few, I can tuck them under the leaves and the weight without too much trouble. Layer three is horseradish leaves to help keep everyone down. Layer four is fermentation weights on top. The main rule is – if it’s all under the brine, it will be fine – so always have more brine than you need in there, to ensure that everything is well submerged. Then, as the pickles pile up, add more brine as needed, to cover everyone, and everything. And so it goes, for the next  weeks or so, while the cucumbers are in season. By the second quarter of the next moon, I’ll stop adding cucumbers to this crock. And once they’re all in there, I’ll leave it another week, then taste, and bottle when it’s ready. For most lacto-ferments, I let them ferment on my kitchen bench, so that they’re in an ambient, roomish temperature. With these progressive pickles, I’m after somewhere a bit cooler – which slows the fermentation process a little, without slowing it down too much. At this time of year, the perfect pickling spot is outside our front door, in the all-day shade. About  degrees colder than room temp, but not fridge-cold. Perfect. Also, fermentation (for me, anyway) is as much about noticing, habits and choosing a spot where you will definitely check in on the fermenting thing, very regularly. Which is why the kitchen bench works so well – it’s right in your face, every time you make a cuppa. Outside the front door is also good spot. I’m passing there all the time, it’s easy to get to, and not in the rain. Therefore, my brain says, it’s perfectly doable to go to this spot every day to add a few more cucumbers, and to check on things. Having ruined many a crock of slow-fermenting hope by stashing it somewhere a bit too far out of the way for my daily patterns, I have learned this lesson the hard way. My optimism of ‘I will definitely go down to that obscure spot in the garden every morning to check on it no matter what life throws at me each day’ is not to be listened to, I have found. I must put the ferments on the bench. Or in the hallway. Or by the front door. So – progressive pickles pickling, by the shady front door. Adding a note to say ‘I’m fermenting, leave me be’ is a good idea, too. Pickles are particularly important in our house these days, as I’ve needed to re-imagine what care, and love, looks like. In the last few years, how things like meals and food work in our house has changed quite drastically. There’s a lot to explain, and some of it’s not my story to tell, so by way of contrast… Three years ago, we ate every meal together, as a family. While we had likes and dislikes, I mostly cooked from the garden, seasonally, and what was on your plate was what you ate, and you stayed at the table until you ate it. All of it. The food was nourishing, wholesome, and made with love. It was also my imagined version of what best-practice care looked like – based on my influences, my upbringing, and how I felt a family ‘should’ spend time together, if they were to remain unbroken as a unit. Also – if you didn’t show up at the table for dinner every night and be chatty and sprightly, then (in my mind) you categorically Did Not Care. And I would tend to take that personally, because my own wounds assumed that this was so. Cheese toasties, posted through the door of my teen’s bedroom with a simple murmured ‘I love you’ from me, each and every night for months at a time, was not on my radar as a form of care – neither in the giving, nor in the being able to ask for. However. In the last three years, this household has been on a whirlwind journey of discovery, care, mental health, un-masking, and truth-telling, such as we can each articulate. Things have changed. I now know that, for my kid, caring looks very different to insisting that they sit down for dinner and Talk To Me at the alotted time that has been allocated to us as a family, culturally. I have learned that safe foods (hello, cheese toastie) can soothe, and make many things better, even those things that are very, very hard to keep living with, and through. I have learned that insisting that we do things in the Family Way, for no other reason than I’d absorbed that to NOT do things in this way signalled failure, or harm, or shame, or Not Caring – was something I needed to let go of. Care can look like chats and a snack together, when it’s a good day, and warming safe-foods, in the quiet of your bedroom, with minimal words exchanged (and maybe an extra pickle), when it’s not a good day. Care can look like learning to pay close attention to what is actually doable for this kid, on this day, rather than assuming I know better, and pushing them too far. Family time can look like whatever it needs to – far away from the sit-down wholesome dinner – and instead, a cuddle on the couch and a joke shared – if that’s where everyone is at, that day. Care is adapting, to keep everyone intact. Care is tending to my own sadness gently, when days are hard, and being ready for tomorrow to be better. Perhaps. I know that next year, our daily setup might look like something else again. Family time might look entirely different, as things change. Because they do change. And if we’re all back at the dining table each evening next year, because that works for everyone, then – great. But I’ve come to learn that what really matters is that I continue to figure out how to listen, and show up – based on what is needed, rather than what is assumed. For those that I love. And for myself, also. All this has been a great (as in immense, as opposed to fun) time of learning. And it has affected what I cook, what I spend time on, what I focus on growing in the garden, and what I do not. But I’m damned if I’m going to stop fermenting entirely. Because it is SO FUN and also GOOD FOR YOU. Luckily, cucumber pickles are firmly on the yes-please list, at our house. Everyone eats them, gladly. On toasties, on snack-plates, beside noodles, or on their own. Pickles. Pickles can be a primary form of care. Pickles can be the best way to say – I see you, and I care about you, and you will get through this time. And I am here. And also, here is another pickle. And so, my kitchen staples – the wholesome, made-with-love basics that I make from scratch, in quantity, and try to have around all through the year – are changing. We prettymuch run this house on large jars of toastie sauce (full of garlic, herbs and tomatoes, I’ll show you another time), and pickles. OSome of our chickens’ eggs are swapped for a big loaf of sourdough on a Tuesday, with our local CSA bakery (thanks lovelies!). I do not make the cheese for the toasties at the moment, although I’ve done that a lot in the past, and that’s fine with me. But I do try to make the pickles, if I can. We always run out by next spring, but that’s still  seasons of lacto-fermented wonderment I can get into my family each year, so that’s a win that I hold onto. And so, the slow progress of the pickle continues – as a fundamental form of care, and what else love can look like, in our current household setup. I am glad to have the help of this species, Cucumis sativus, to learn more about biding time, picking things when they are ready, and adapting recipes (and world views) to what is needed. In order to keep caring for each other, according to what each season requires of us. Big big thanks to Eggplantia and also to Alex Kelly for their great conversations about re-imagining what family care can look like with neurodiverse kids, which really helped me along – love you babes x Oh! And also, this piece (or an earlier version, that i banged out late one night and hit ‘post’ on)… is from my new-ish garden/moon/scrapbook writing project –  Moons on melukerdee Country. I’m not sure what this project will be, just yet. But the plants are teaching me so much, in the meantime. You are welcome to join the conversation there, too.      ;Milkwood
"A note: this article is partly an extract from The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook – from chapter one, Observe and Interact. If you’re not familiar with this book, you might like to start by reading the Habits, Hope and the Power of and/also … or the What is Permaculture extracts. Just an idea. These thoughts lead on to the chapters of prompts, actions and ideas to get you started with living like it matters, starting with chapter one, Observe and interact. Ok, here we go. 

Observe and Interact is the first of Holmgren’s permaculture principles. But it’s also a prompt, that can lead you to all kinds of amazing new adventures, wonderings, and knowings. In times like these – we need to act, to make things better… and we also need to pause at times, and get comfortable with stillness, in order to truly see what is around us. To feel what is inside us.

Practicing new ways of seeing, and taking action as a result of this new learning, can help keep us together, deepen our connection with the life all around us, and, on a practical level, help us each get by, in times like these. Ok so that sounds a bit existential, AND IT IS. But it is also a very simple concept, that you can try out next time you step out your front door. What is there, on the ground infront of you (or in the sky above you), that you may not have seen before? And how can we best make good decisions, and take positive action, as a result of that seeing? For all the other animal species around us, the principle of Observe and interact is a constant state of being.  Observing with all of your senses is a given if you’re a small fluffy thing that lives in a forest (pick whatever species works for you; I’m going with bandicoot, but you do you).  Without this constant, awakened level of observation and interaction on multiple levels, life in the forest can be short. For humans, however, there’s a certain sense that we’ve outsourced this decision-making process of ‘what to do next’.  And while some of this outsourcing has yielded some excellent results – you could be forgiven for thinking that we’ve lost more of our animal, instinctual, observational selves than is healthy along the way. We still notice, observe and react to plenty of the ‘in your face’ happenings of life, of course.  But what about the smaller, everyday things that are happening all around us, and inside us?  What can we learn, and what can we reclaim of ourselves, by gathering a deeper understanding of these smaller things? This permaculture principle is all about reclaiming a little of your inner bandicoot – and giving yourself permission to deeply consider a bit more of the everyday everything: the feelings in your tummy, the ground under your feet, the clouds in the sky and everything in between. What might observing – really learning to see, to be aware – look like in your day-to-day life? How can you cultivate new skills in observing, learning and interacting in a way that empowers you to take actions that make life better? Don’t worry; you don’t need to be standing in a pristine ecosystem or a beautiful garden to get started with any of this.  Engaging with your immediate environment can begin at a very practical level, without even going outside; for example, by simply choosing different ways to regulate your own temperature. Can you put on a jumper, instead of turning up the heat? Should you open the blinds this morning to let the warm sun in, or keep them closed so the house stays cool? Now take a step further out. Do you notice how much water is washed down the gutter, or how much fresh food seems to go to waste in your fridge because you just don’t get to it? When was the last time you truly noticed the seasonal changes in your neighbourhood?  Have you seen any bees in your yard lately? Simply observing these things is the first step in engaging with them. The ‘interact’ part of this chapter is where the fun really starts.  What you choose to do with the new- found knowledge you gain from observing, and how you can make changes as a result, is limited only by your imagination . . . which is a good thing. Because we know you have plenty of imagination. And may I let you in on a little secret?  Every single small change you decide on, each small habit you form, and each action you take adds up to – your life. So how do you truly want to live? It’s the habits and actions of every day that will get you there.  To get you started, we’ve gathered together some darn fine ideas for ways that you can Observe and Interact in your home and local ‘hood.  Might we suggest that you read through and then pick one (or dream up your own, once you see what we mean) to make into a new habit or project, at your place?  Doing this, committing to one small new habit, action or project, is a great way to gently move forward, AND powerfully hold yourself accountable to where you’d like to go, with creating a more abundant life.  And once you’ve got that one thing down, choose another small habit to add into your every day.  And then another, and another. Who knows what amazing place you’ll find yourself in, by the end of all this…. Learning to identify your local weeds (which we prefer to call ‘wild plants’) is an excellent way to build your observation skills and your relationship with your ecosystem any time, in any place.  Because these are the types of plants which will often grow literally anywhere.  You don’t need a backyard, or a garden, or a farm to be in relationship to these lifeforms: a willingness to learn and eyes tuned to pattern-recognition mode will get you started, wherever you live. But why bother learning about, gathering and using weeds? Well, it’s a simple way to build your resilience, and connect you to the place where you live.  Once you become a proficient forager, you can gather wild plants locally and use them at home to make tasty, nutritious dishes and simple medicines. Minimum food miles, zero packaging and maximum connection to the place you call home. And all for free. Our local wild plants tell us about where we live and what the landscape is going through: where the wet patches are, where the soil is compacted, what used to be there. They also connect us with histories – our own and those of families who came before us – medicine, food, fibre and stories. By learning to use your local weeds, you can reinvigorate this ancestral knowledge and pass it forward, so others can develop vital and functional connections to the plants and places where they live, too. Cultivating this habit will change the way you see your street, your local parks and even what pops up out of your pot plant’s soil. It’s a great honour to meet the wild plants where you live; they have a lot to teach you… When was the last time you thought about where your toothpaste comes from, or what it was before it was turned into toothpaste? Let me guess: never? That’s the thing about everyday household products; they’re all around us, yet we rarely pause to actually ‘see’ them. We’re too busy brushing our teeth with them, washing up with them or cleaning the bench with them. Yet each product we purchase comes with an impact, especially the items we buy regularly and don’t really think about.  Taking time to dig into one (yes, start with just one!) of these products can be eye-opening. You might observe how your toothpaste, say, connects you with faraway supply lines, raw materials, manufacturers and communities of people and their landscapes, all of which are implicated each time you brush your teeth. This deep knowledge can inform all sorts of choices or changes. It’s possible you will discover previously unseen impacts that don’t quite sit right with you, now that you know.  Perhaps the ingredients in that ‘nature scented’ cleaner you use each week are actually not very good for you or your family. Or a faraway ecosystem is being damaged by your go-to dental floss. Or landfill is the only disposal option for a certain item, once you’ve finished with it… * Awareness doesn’t need to be a guilt trip – This is meant to be an exercise in observation and interaction, not a guilt trip. You may find out that a product that you use every day is not great for the environment, but you may not have an alternative, at this point. Committing to this habit is a way to build awareness, which will lead to the possibility of choices that better align with your own personal ethics – maybe right now, or maybe later.  Whatever you decide, life cycle mapping of an everyday item will help you better understand the value and impact of what you’re bringing into your home. “Australia is founded on land that was stolen from Indigenous people. The wealth that has been generated by that theft is disproportionately distributed. All people who live here today, or who have lived here in the past, have not benefited equally from the continuing dispossession of Indigenous people. Indeed, many are deliberately and profoundly marginalised from power and the spoils of colonialism. Paying the rent is a step towards acknowledging these facts. It is part of a process that all non-Indigenous people – individually and collectively – need to enter into if we are to move towards justice, truth, equality and liberation for First Nations people” – Pay The Rent Grassroots Collective This fundamental habit is very simple, and you can start doing it today. Pay the rent to the people upon whose traditional lands you live and work and benefit from, each and every day.  Nearly everywhere (in Australia, at least), the Country beneath your feet was never ceded – it was colonised. Taken. And whether you’re a homeowner, renter or otherwise, you now directly benefit from this Country, as well as its traditional owners’ knowledge and stewardship. So, pay the rent. Hopefully, in the future, we will all work together to achieve reparations for traditional owners. But we’re still a fair way from achieving this kind of large-scale, coordinated response.  What you CAN do though, right now – without waiting for further permission or structural reform – is pay the rent yourself. This is not about white guilt, or colonial settler guilt – it’s about simply checking your privilege. And doing the right thing. Not living on stolen land, but part of a nation or state that is or was a force of colonisation, and thereby deeply associated with the extraction of resources and historical injustice to Indigenous peoples that goes along with that? This action is for you, too.  We all like to keep warm in winter and cool in summer. It’s a mammal thing. But all that gas or electricity for heating and cooling can be your household’s single biggest contributor to carbon emissions, a driver of climate change. Plus these systems are often expensive to run.  The good news is you will see a huge difference by making simple, small behavioural changes or adjustments to your home and environment that will have positive effects for your health, household budget and the planet, too. Actively managing the temperature of your home when possible – and turning off the air conditioning and heating whenever you can – is actually quite doable, in most climates. And in every climate, there’s things that you CAN do, to make life a bit more comfortable, without ongoing cost.  And it is possible no matter where you live: in every country and city, in rentals, apartments and farmhouses, and everywhere in between. Because this is partly about your own behaviour, and rethinking that, as well as all the other factors at play…. This habit is subtle but powerful: how much do you know about the water that flows around where you live? Where does it come from and where does it go? These waterways were once intrinsic to your community’s health on a practical, day-to-day basis. Water is life, after all. These days, many of us are disconnected from our local waterways. No matter how urban our local ’hood, we can deepen our sense of connection to place. This is an exercise in observation, interaction and discovery, which can reveal all sorts of things about your place – in a similar way to learning about the wild plants where you live. Discovering your local waterways can involve looking at maps, doing some research, possibly using your feet and committing some time. While investigating, you might pause to reflect on what the state of your local waterway says about your community. What does the health of your waterway mean for ecosystems and communities downstream too? While pondering all that, you might also find yourself thinking, ‘Hey, wait a minute – where does the water from my sink and shower go?’ Well, it goes to a variety of places, depending on where you live, but it will always wind up in your local water table, waterway or ocean. So, how you interact with the water in your house has a flow-on effect to larger water bodies near and far.  Yes, those same water bodies you’re about to get more acquainted with! Knowing more about the health – or lack thereof – of these waterways might spark questions, such as: ‘What biosphere-safe soaps and detergents can I use or make, to minimise my impact?’ Even if you opt only for discussing what you’ve learned about your local waterways, this observing and interacting will add richness to your daily routine, and depth to your understanding of your place….  Hey, while we’re here, we thought we’d share this video lesson from our Permaculture Living course with you… It’s the first lesson in the Observe and Interact week of the course – with Dave explaining a bit about the principle, and Kirsten expanding on what kind of small actions you can take to get started with it all. (for context, after this lesson, we work through a bunch of actions and options with students – as video lessons, live community chats and downloadable guides… mentoring them as they go, to learn new skills and try new stuff.) Here’s the video: How are you feeling about all these possible projects and futures? Excited? Overwhelmed? Can’t wait to get going? Have you scribbled a million notes? Can you more clearly imagine new worlds, with more fun, more possibility and more hope, that you can see yourself being an integral part of? It’s possible. It’s all possible. Just remember: no-one needs to do all the things. But we can each do some of the things. Take on one new habit or one small project at a time, and keep at it until it’s part of your new normal. No big deal. And once it’s just something that you do, that you enjoy and that works for you and yours . . . choose the next new habit or project. And build that future of yours, piece by piece. This is how we build lives that are worth living, and how we change the world. By changing our worlds – each of us, and all of us together – with small endless days that add up to lives that are rooted in meaning, in relationship and reciprocity, and grounded in purposeful action and hope. Living at this time on Earth – with all of the challenges and all of the beauty – with our feet on living soil and our hearts wide open. Thanks for reading – plz comment if you have any thoughts?

Companion planting isn’t about strict rules – it’s about principles, observation, and learning from your garden – it’s about understanding how different plants can work together, creating a garden that is more resilient, productive, and a joy to tend. Carrots, silverbeet, and flowering coriander doing their companionable thing in our garden is a perfect example of how some plants tend to naturally support each other. Whether it’s one plant providing shade for another, fixing nitrogen in the soil, or attracting beneficial insects, these relationships strengthen our backyard ecosystems. By understanding how different plants can work together, we can create gardens that are even more resilient, productive, and a pleasure to tend. And figuring out which plants benefit each other is a part of this, that even beginner gardens can happily learn! …by our students, and there’s many opinions (and experiences) on what works and what doesn’t, in different contexts! I used to love our companion gardening books, but nowadays I see the whole ‘who to plant next to whom’ from a different angle… Instead of just using lists, observation and experimentation is invaluable to guide you toward the combinations of veggies that will thrive nearby each other, in your garden context. As you plant, take note of what works, adapt with the seasons, and let your garden evolve into a dynamic, self-reliant system where plants, soil, and pollinators all play their part. So firstly – may I suggest that companion planting, particularly with annual vegetables, is at its most basic about identifying which different plants have complementary needs, and outputs. Different plants that like the same amount of fertility and watering, at the same time of year, could be a good match if you need to huddle multiple crops into one garden bed. Or it might be that one crop provides shade, while the next crop is young and needs protection, and their roots won’t interfere much with each other (carrots and radishes, I’m looking at you). There’s a million other combinations and examples of annual veg being good friends with each other. Plus there’s all the microbial relationships happening in the soil food web below your vegetables – all the microbes and fungi and everyone else in there, which all contribute to how well different plants grow. So yes, companion planting IS a way to embrace the interconnectedness of plants, insects, and soil. And some of the knowledges that we have now have, do come from both traditional wisdoms and modern ecological science. However – it’s often as much about shared or opposing needs and functions as it is about ‘this plant doesn’t like that plant’… so don’t worry – you’re very unlikely to kill your tomatoes if you plant them next to something that some companion planting guide somewhere said they were not compatible with. That said, there’s some vegetables that just love growing together, and always do really well when planted side-by-side. So when you see this happen in your garden, make a note. Over time, you can create your own companion planting chart for what grows well, and with whom, where you live. Companion planting is about designing, observing, learning and then co-evolving a system of plantings that work with your ecosystem, where you are. Instead of rigid lists dictating what grows best with what, much of this can be worked out by observing and experimenting. Take fertilising, for instance-many plants, like peas, beans, lupins, and clover, fix nitrogen from the air and enrich the soil. Their spent foliage can be used to fertilise neighboring plants, especially if cut down before they divert energy into seed production. Companion planting is about more than just arranging plants, though-it’s also about working with nature to suppress weeds and manage pests. Plants like radishes and brassicas, left to flower and seed, can naturally inhibit weed growth while conditioning the soil for the next crop. Marigolds form a natural barrier against invasive grasses, and comfrey keeps out persistent kikuyu while doubling as a fantastic mulch. Even pests can be controlled by encouraging their natural predators-birds, beneficial insects, and tiny predatory wasps all thrive in gardens filled with year-round flowering plants. So make sure you have plenty of those. By mixing up plantings, creating natural camouflage, and maintaining a diverse garden ecosystem, pests get confused, weeds get suppressed, and predators do the heavy lifting, leaving you free to enjoy a bountiful and balanced garden. At its core, companion planting is about creating diverse ecosystems. Plants don’t exist in isolation, just like us! They thrive in communities, each species playing its part. Here’s how they do it: The roots of complementary plant pairings and groupings run deep. One great example of this is the “Three Sisters” planting method that comes to us from Turtle Island cultures – Maize corn providing a living trellis for beans, the beans enriching the soil, and squash or pumpkins covering the ground to retain moisture and suppress weeds. Yay for reciprocity. Many studies now back these principles up – diverse plantings can lower pest populations, improve soil health, and even boost yields. And, whether you’re growing in a backyard or on a balcony, these principles hold true. Here’s a little starter chart to guide you…. although, again, you can’t beat your own powers of observation and experimentation, especially as every garden is different! However, given that there’s many companion planting books that repeat not-quite-truisms, we’ve included below what we’ve seen work in a range of climates, and plant combos that generally do well in proximity to each other. It’s also about harnessing the hidden superpowers of certain plants that offer unique benefits to the whole garden ecosystem. Some of these plants can be planted as ‘trap crops’ borders or clumps of plants that draw pests away from other valuable harvests. Some plants deter pests, while others enrich the soil, enhance compost, or even boost the yield of neighbouring crops. Here’s a collection of garden allies that can work their magic in unexpected ways: These plants are just a few of the examples of plants helping each other (and you) out – and helping to build a more resilient, biodiverse, and low-maintenance garden in the process. Whether you’re looking to deter pests, improve soil health, or simply create a healthier growing space, adding a few of these powerhouse plants can make a lot of difference. Ok, that’s all great, but where do you start? Well, here’s a SUPER brief rundown… So – companion planting can be a celebration of how plants, insects, and soil work together. It’s about letting your emerging backyard ecosystem lead the way, and working with your garden to create a thriving, interconnected system. Start small, take notes, and experiment. Ok, so you could start there – and that would be great. However, if you also have perennials (like fruit trees) in your garden somewhere, and are looking for ways to ensure they thrive, let me introduce you to… A guild planting, in permaculture terms, is usually used to define a harmonious assembly of species clustered around a central element (plant or animal) that acts in relation to this element to assist its health, aid our work in management, or buffer adverse environmental effects (Mollison, via Jacke). Dave Jacke has taken this concept further and identifies a range of different types of guilds that generally (but not exclusively) can be applied to aid forest garden design process. Like many permaculture design elements, these guild types at once simple, and deeply complex…  And yes, you can use guild plantings in polyculture vegetable gardens, as well. There’s so many options! And so much to learn. A lifetime, even… Whew! Wow, that’s a lot of info. Feel free to comment below if you have any questions, at this point… And know that each season will bring new lessons, and every plant has a role to play. Happy planting, learning and working with your lil backyard ecosystem! If you’d like to learn to create and maintain a veggie garden with friendly expert help, no matter where you live, please do check out our Beginner’s Guide to Veggie Gardening below… … and also our Organic Vegetable Gardening online course, which is a cracker.     ;Milkwood
Can you grow mushrooms in bamboo? Why yes, you can. Oyster mushrooms can be grown in all kinds of containers – it just depends where you are, and the resources around you. But there’s a few things to think about, before you choose… here’s some options for low-waste mushroom cultivation… There’s lots and lots of different containers you can use to grow mushrooms in – they all have a few features in common though, to be suitable for fungi. A good container for growing mushrooms should: So. Depending on the species of mushroom you’re growing, and where you live… this ideal container might look like – food grade plastic buckets. Or freshly cut logs of wood, or a garden of woodchip, or empty water bottles, or feed-sacks, full of straw, or glass jars, or something else… like bamboo. A note on plastics – growing organic mushrooms in plastic might seem like a weird contradiction. What if the mushrooms eat the plastic? And even if the mycelium doesn’t break it down, could the mushrooms absorb plastic toxins? None of us want more plastic in our lives, our food, or our ecosystems. Yep, we’ve thought about this too. After a fair bit of research, we’ve found that sturdy, recycled, food-grade buckets are an excellent option for mushroom cultivation-especially if they’re the most practical choice for where you live and what’s available to you. Fungi are pretty amazing, and some species can break down certain plastics over time. But this process is slow, and when given a choice, mycelium will prioritise organic materials like straw or sawdust over plastic. If the mycelium did degrade plastic over time, it’s important to recognise that this doesn’t mean it disappears without consequence. Some plastics break down into microplastics or release chemical additives, which may persist in the environment or enter the food chain. That’s why the type of plastic matters. Food-grade polypropylene (PP) is one of the most stable and least likely to leach harmful compounds. It doesn’t break down easily, reducing the risk of contamination, especially if kept out of direct sunlight to prevent UV degradation. So, while fungi will usually go for the meal (your carefully prepared substrate) rather than the plate (the bucket), using high-quality, food-grade plastic minimises risks. If food-grade buckets are your best option, they can be a practical and safe choice-just use them wisely and keep them in good condition. The key with low-waste mushroom cultivation is looking at what resource you have around you – that are plentiful and suitable – to grow mushrooms. In some places, food-grade buckets make the most sense. Other places might have very high humidity, and hessian bags full of straw might make the most sense. Meanwhile in Nakivale Refugee Settlement in Uganda, where a bunch of our students live, it depends on what you can get hold of – plastic buckets, plastic water bottles, and sometimes bags make the most sense to grow mushrooms in. And things can change. So they roll with it. Use what you’ve got. The point here is to grow nutrient-dense food and medicine, using simple waste products, wherever you live, as part of your everyday. In terms of single-use plastic – ANY of the above options are likely to be better than buying mushrooms from a store, from a waste viewpoint – because with the store-bought option, you will almost certainly be eating mushrooms that have been grown in single-use plastic bags. So – do your best, get creative figuring out the best options for you, and grow mushrooms with what you’ve got. A while back, we were teaching permaculture design at Kul Kul Farm in Bali, and with the help of Maria and Orin, the farm’s founders (and excellent people) – we cooked up a free workshop for locals (and students) on growing mushrooms. Hmm – containers – what would be suitable, locally available in good supply, and either super-cheap or free? ‘Bamboo!’ Said Orin. Yessss, we answered happily. Let’s do it. Freshly-cut giant bamboo can make a perfect container to grow oyster mushrooms in. The bamboo grows in segments, creating great little containers that can be used. It’s light, and easy to move around. And because the bamboo is freshly cut, it’s not contaminated with other spores or mould. And…. bamboo grows fast, and is everywhere, around Kul Kul Farm. Perfect! The main process of growing oyster mushrooms in containers is the same – no matter if you use buckets, bamboo, or something else. It’s the same method, as far as the mushrooms are concerned. I’ve added our beginner’s guide below so you can get a sense of how this all works: And then – with a bit of preparation and a lot of bamboo cutting, we all got growing mushrooms, as a crew…. It’s always so great to see folks leaving a workshop, happy with their container of future mushrooms, and heading home with the hands-on skills to grow more! We love it. We left Kul Kul Farm a few days later and headed home, while the mushrooms incubated in their little bamboo containers, at many homes nearby… for about two weeks, before they fruited. And then, Maria sent us these awesome photos of the results. Thanks lovely! And I heard they were delicious, too. So there you go. Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can – the bamboo mushroom version (w thanks to Arthur Ashe)…  And a note that, for all our courses, if you need a hand in order to make the learning happen – head to our Fair Share program to apply for a discount or scholarship. We got you, no matter where you’re at. Big thanks to Maria & Orin Hardy (who are now focussing on BamboouBali– which has a resource-rich website here), and all the students and local folks who came along to the mushroom workshop – grow well, lovelies! Various pics above taken by us, Maria Hardy, and Sash Milne – thanks, lovely humans. Got any questions or wondering? Add them below in the comments, we’re happy to help x     ;Milkwood
"I can’t wait to get into this Permaculture Holiday Reads book-stack. All are books that I’ve been waiting to read for MONTHS, or have just come out, or just been discovered (by me)…. Like many folks, I sleep beside an aspirational book-stack. The tower-like shrine to ‘one day, when I have a few hours spare’ fantasy time and reading land… This summer, though, I’m planning to make some headway. Now that it’s high-summer here, there’s plenty of garden work to do (weeding, watering, generally keeping things alive, harvesting, weaving fences, more weeding) that doesn’t require my full brain’s attention… which means, it’s Audiobook season! I will still have to rewind every fourth page when my attention strays to a bee or a flower and I miss the good bit, but that’s ok. I love having wise voices in my ears as I plant and weed and weave and play. I’ve included any audiobook versions that i could find to the notes below too. In no particular order, here’s my upcoming picks. I’ve included links to the author’s work, website, and any tasty interviews I’ve listened to with them recently. I’m so looking forward to digging into this one – I’ve loved amb’s work since I came across her book Pleasure Activism, and then two of their smaller (but huge) works –Emergent Strategy and We Will Not Cancel Us – were dear friends to me during the work of attempting to create and maintain community in a new place, during the Covid years. Here’s what the back of the book has to say: “Ethical, pondering, and wondrous, adrienne maree brown’s Loving Corrections is a collection of love-based adjustments and reframes to grow our movements for liberation while navigating a society deeply fractured by greed, racism, and war. In this landmark book, brown invigorates her influential writing on belonging and accountability into the framework of “loving corrections” a generative space where rehearsals for the revolution become the everyday norm in relating to one another. Filled with practical wisdom on how to be a trustworthy communicator while providing bold visions for a shared future, Loving Corrections can speak to everyone caught in the crossroads of our political challenges and potential. No matter how new to the struggle, or how numerous our failures, brown’s indispensable writing is an invitation to us all.“ “Plantcestral Herbalism and Healing Cultures from Syria to the Sinai–Earth-based pathways to ancestral stewardship and belonging in diaspora…” I began this book last winter, loved it, got distracted, and am coming back to read the whole thing. Diving into pockets of knowledge from the ‘crossroads’ (the Middle East) in personal and plant-based form seems a good way in, for hearts that are already struggling with the injustice of everything that is happening in this part of our world. “Tying cultural survival to earth-based knowledge, Lebanese ethnobotanist, sovereignty steward, and cultural worker Layla K. Feghali offers a layered history of the healing plants of Cana’an (the Levant) and the Crossroads (“Middle East”) and asks into the ways we become free from the wounds of colonization and displacement. Feghali remaps Cana’an and its crossroads, exploring the complexities, systemic impacts, and yearnings of diaspora. She shows how ancestral healing practices connect land and kin-calling back and forth across geographies and generations and providing an embodied lifeline for regenerative healing and repair. How do we embody what binds us together while holding the ways we’ve been wrested apart? What does it mean to be of a place when extraction and empire destroy its geographies? What can we restore when we reach beyond what’s been lost and tend to what remains? How do we cultivate kinship with the lands where we live, especially when migration has led us to other colonized territories? The Land in Our Bones asks us to reclaim the integrity of our worlds, interrogating colonization and defying its “cultures of severance” through the guidance of land, lineage, and love. It is an urgent companion for our times, a beckoning call towards belonging, healing, and freedom through tending the land in your own bones.” I’m looking forward to diving into this short story collection by Lauren, after having LOVED her newest book ‘The Vaster Wilds’ earlier this year (anyone else struggle with reading fiction sometimes? The Vaster Wilds is a good antidote to this). Short stories (and I’m sure hers will be gripping, just like her novels) are my fave way to wind-down before sleep. Also good for beachy afternoons, I expect. “Nine wildly unique, exquisitely symphonic tales, full of beauty, tragedy, and the sudden horror of shocking images….Groff moves among these wholly unrelated worlds with a vision that happily traps the reader. Highly recommended.” –LIBRARY JOURNAL In other awesome news, when she’s not writing, Lauren leads a bookshop collective called The Lynx Books… a new general-interest bookstore in Gainesville, Florida, with an emphasis in books that are currently challenged or banned in Florida, as well as those by BIPOC authors, LGBTQ+ authors, and Florida authors… …where they also hold events like Banned Book Club and offers free workshops on how to get such books re-stocked in your Florida school library. So good. …ok ok this book is not strictly permaculture content, it’s true. But resting, and reading fun things IS essential to permaculture design, and life in general. So here we are. Ok So I really want to make my way through this book based on this conversation that Ajay had on the Upstream Podcast (do recommend, it’s fascinating) – and we’ve been talking about that conversation ever since. “Climate change is not only about the exhaustion of the planet, it’s about the exhaustion of so many of us, our lives, our worlds, even our minds. So, what is to be done? To answer this question, Ajay Singh Chaudhary brings together both the science and the politics of climate change. He shows how a new politics particular to the climate catastrophe demands a bitter struggle between those attached to the power, wealth, and security of “business-as-usual” and all of us, those exhausted, in every sense of the word, by the status quo.“ I do expect this book to be quite dense but Ima gonna give it a go anyways. I rekon it will be worth it. Yay, this collaboration has been brewing for a long time! Costa, host of Gardening Australia and all-round excellent human has teamed up for a series of kids books with the fabulous Brenna Quinlan – who has illustrated our two Milkwood books, plus many others besides. Being Brenna and Costa, they’re celebrating this book launch with an east-coast tour of Australia with Formidiable Vegetable, the best party band who also offer great gardening advice in every song. The first book in the series is ‘Costa’s Garden: Flowers‘ and I’m looking forward to them launching it at our local Cygnet Folk Festival in January. All the other tour dates (you should totally go) are here. One of my fave all-time authors has a new book!  years after Braiding Sweetgrass, here it is. It’s little, it’s gorgeous. I’ll probably read it at least  times in the coming season. “From the # New York Times bestselling author of Braiding Sweetgrass, a bold and inspiring vision for how to orient our lives around gratitude, reciprocity, and community, based on the lessons of the natural world.  Indigenous scientist and author Robin Wall Kimmerer asks how can we learn from indigenous wisdom and the plant world to reimagine what we value most? Our economy is rooted in scarcity, competition, and the hoarding of resources, and we have surrendered our values to a system that actively harms what we love. Meanwhile, the serviceberry’s relationship with the natural world is an embodiment of reciprocity, interconnectedness, and gratitude. The tree distributes its wealth-its abundance of sweet, juicy berries-to meet the needs of its natural community. And this distribution insures its own survival. As Kimmerer explains, “Serviceberries show us another model, one based upon reciprocity, where wealth comes from the quality of your relationships, not from the illusion of self-sufficiency.” As Elizabeth Gilbert writes, Robin Wall Kimmerer is “a great teacher, and her words are a hymn of love to the world.” The Serviceberry is an antidote to the broken relationships and misguided goals of our times, and a reminder that “hoarding won’t save us, all flourishing is mutual.” After listening to a conversation with Zoe on the Emergence podcast, I started listening to this book as I work in our garden in the evening. It’s great! But I can’t underline the many pearlers of thought and revelation on my audiobook, so I’ll have to read the hard copy this summer. I’ll let Robin tell it like it is (ha!) –

“Burning with open-minded curiosity, this exploration of the emerging revolution in plant science will challenge what you think you know and ignite a new way of seeing. Part detective story, field trip, and philosophy, this brilliant book stretches the mind toward a profound new understanding of the sophistication of under-appreciated plants. I feel it as an antidote to arrogance, as it engenders humility, respect, and awe for the light eaters who make the world.” – Robin Wall Kimmerer, author of Braiding Sweetgrass Every summer I try to re-read one of my fave permaculture textbooks – and I ALWAYS find jewels of knowledge that speak to me in a different way than they did previously, which I last read the book. This summer, it’s totally Rowe Morrow’s book. Re-issued and re-edited, this is one of the books we recommend to students all the time in the ‘if you were just going to read ONE permaculture book, choose this one‘ category. This book is a lifetime of learning and observation, in many, many places that sit well outside the cosy backyard context. And it’s damn practical, too. So. Much. Good. Material within these pages…. and now with a foreword by Vandana Shiva. Here’s a little bio about Rowe – “Rowe originally studied Agricultural Science at the Sorbonne, in Paris, but then developed a passion for learner-centred teaching in the community. She walked away from formal education and has been teaching permaculture for  years. To this day she is still fascinated by adult non-formal education and the respect it demands from the teacher for students’ prior knowledge and skills. She regards teaching and learning as generous reciprocal acts and has taught permaculture in many unusual and challenging places off the beaten track. Her current focus is Permaculture for Refugees and she has been training more people to teach permaculture around the world, and particularly in refugee camps. “ If you haven’t read it, I really couldn’t recommend The Earth Users Guide more. I’m looking forward to sitting under a tree with it very soon. Got any other great reading / listening recommendations for me? I would love to hear them. May we all find a tree to sit beneath, with some tea and a good read, these holidays. Thanks for being here x     ";Milkwood
"There’s nothing more rewarding than growing, harvesting and enjoying produce that you’ve grown yourself, and we’d love to see everyone growing some of their own vegetables at home. But, starting a vegetable garden can be a bit overwhelming, we know – there’s a lot to think about! Happily, we’ve created a free guide for you which will help you get started – to design, build, plant and grow the veggie garden of your dreams. This guide breaks down the basic process into manageable steps, and contains HEAPS of resources and ideas for you to explore. This guide is a condensed snippet from our Organic Vegetable Gardening online course, which we run once a season. Starting a garden can feel a bit overwhelming. Where to begin? What’s most important? So a great first step to creating the garden of your dreams is to articulate your Garden Goals – so you are clear on what you are trying to
achieve. Clarifying your garden goals allows you to create the right garden for you, and to meet your needs and not waste your time, energy or money by going off track. We want you to create a garden that works for YOU, and your unique resources and abilities. The basics of how to tackle your garden design. What matters from this process is that you’ve got the information you need to begin, by the end of it – your design doesn’t need to look pretty at this point, just functional – scribbly diagrams welcome! Once you’ve made a solid plan for your veggie garden site, it’s time to get better acquainted with your soil, and decide what type of garden beds will meet your veggie growing needs. There are so many veggies out there, how do you choose? A good first step is to consider ones that you like to eat, will thrive in your location and that are suited to the season. Matching your veggie choices to the conditions in your patch, and considering bigger weather patterns and climate, will save you time, energy, and money. Once you’ve built your garden beds, and they’re ready to go with a lovely layer of compost or aged manure on top, you’re ready to rock and roll and plant those veggies! You’ll need to source, plant and care for your new plants and veggie patch, including dealing with weeds; or as we like to call them, ‘plants out of place’. With your veggies planted and growing, you’ll need a little infrastructure to help them be their best! Soon, your tall plants may need support structures to climb. And before summer comes you’ll want clever ways to water your thirsty veg, and possibly some shade solutions, too. Once you’ve planted out your garden you’ll need to continue to maintain your garden’s health through feeding your soil, and keeping an eye out for unwanted visitors: pests & diseases. Don’t worry, there’s always a way! Once you’ve learned how to plan, build, sow, water and love your veggies, it’s time for the ultimate reward… veggies aplenty. Learn to cook and preserve everything you can, for maximum harvest and happiness. By now, you’ve realised that there’s a fair bit to think about when getting started with your veggie garden design – and it can be helpful to have some help as you design, build, plant and grow. So – we’ve got a resources section of great guides, books, and other ways to keep learning, once you begin.  Wherever ‘home’ is for you, big or small, you CAN grow veggies, if you have some outside space. Whether you’re renting a townhouse with a courtyard, or a big backyard, or out in a rural setting – there’s so many veggies that you can grow where you live, on any budget. We know this from experience! As life-long gardeners, we have designed and created veggie patches of all sizes and shapes, on farms, on rooftops in the city and in every rental we’ve lived in or land or farm that we’ve stewarded. Now we have a big backyard patch in lutruwita Tasmania, which we’re developing into our bestever permaculture backyard system. Over the years Milkwood has worked with amazing gardening experts to teach courses of all types, from balcony gardens all the way up to whole organic market gardens and farms. And now we’ve crafted an online course – Organic Vegetable Gardening – presented by our friend (and exo gardener) Hannah Moloney – to help even more folks take their very first steps toward designing the veggie garden of your dreams. You can dive into all the extra resources in your beginner’s guide right now, to help you get growing. If you have any questions – just comment below, or get in touch! Helping folks to get growing is our jam, so we’re always happy to chat.     ";Milkwood
Heya lovely readers, guess what? Our next intake of Permaculture Living is currently OPEN for bookings, until Wednesday th at pm. So if you’ve been planning to join us for a while, now might be a great time? One of the great things about this -week online course is that if you need to take a break, or go slow, it’s no worries at all! We aren’t going anywhere, and we will support you in the lessons and student forum, answering all your questions – no matter how long you take to move through the course.  I love how the Permaculture Living course can be tailored so much. It’s refreshingly different to typical learning where everyone comes away with the same knowledge. You can really delve into topics and actions that are relevant and appropriate to your life. This was wonderful We love helping people and communities to thrive and succeed in creating resilience, and this course is the perfect place to do that. “The best part for me is the way participants are asked to commit to an action each week. The choices are often pretty simple to achieve, but have me thinking more about permaculture in daily life.” Another great thing about this online course is that it includes an amazing online community where we personally answer all your questions (either in the lessons, or the student forum, or in the live Q&As) so we can help you with just about anything. From fermenting to farm design to ‘why has my plant done this?’ … because yes, we’ve been there too! Maybe we’ll see you in there? If you’re curious about what sort of learning is inside this course, we’ve got lots of useful examples for you – apart for the full course curriculum (which you can view here) – it just so happens that we’ve been sharing snippets of this fine course here on our blog, so you can get started, no-matter-what… Here’s a roundup of lessons and resources from our Permaculture Living course that you can access right now – and a note that this is just a tiny snippet of the course – there is so much more in there… Whew! And all these are only a small slice of what’s inside the course… it’s pretty vast and wide, as you can see. If you’d like to read more about the course, how it works, and what’s inside, all the details are here for you. As said, bookings close at pm on Wednesday th July So there you have it – join us this week if you can, and if now is not the right time for you, join the course waitlist for now, and delve into all the free resources above, in the meantime. What matters most is that you start thinking, dreaming and doing. And we will support you all along the way – either in the blogpost comments, or inside the course’s community forum. All the best, and let us know how you go xx      ;Milkwood
"So, how to compost dog poop? Composting your pet’s poop at home is an excellent way to create even more nutrient-rich fertiliser for your garden soil, super-charging everything you grow within it. It’s something we do with our two little dogs and it’s surprisingly easy – although, depending on what type of pet you have, some extra steps and care are required. If you’re new to composting generally, our Beginners Guide to Composting is a good place to start for all the basics on how to turn your food scraps, paper, gardening prunings, autumn leaves and whatever else into nutrient-rich humus that we all know as ‘compost’. And just like food scraps, pet poop contains valuable nutrients that can be turned into compost too. Firstly – waste from omnivorous or carnivorous animals such as dogs and cats, for example, may carry harmful pathogens that can make you sick if they get on your food. So we never use this kind of compost on our veggie patch – instead, it’s best for orchards, flowerbeds and ornamentals. However – throwing it ‘away’ isn’t a great idea – like food scraps, pet waste thrown into landfill causes a heap of not-great environmental outcomes… So! Since we’re taking responsibility for what we can, here… let’s take a closer look at how to safely recycle your pet’s poo into compost, so you can put this rich resource to use within your own patch – Throwing pet poop ‘away’ isn’t a great idea – like food scraps, pet waste thrown into landfill causes a heap of extremely-not-great environmental outcomes – even if you’re using so-called ‘biodegradable’ poop bags. Trapped in a giant pile of other waste, your pet’s poop is starved of the oxygen needed to break down safely. So it becomes anaerobic and belches out potent greenhouse gases including methane, which is  times more harmful to our atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Flushing pet waste down the toilet causes problems too. Most wastewater treatment systems aren’t designed to remove the parasites pets carry, so they get discharged into our waterways. Kitty litter flushed down your toilet may also swell up and block sewer pipes, or even the pipes in your own home, which can be messy and costly to fix. So! Since we’re all about taking responsibility for what we can, rather than outsourcing problems here… time to lean what to do with it, yes? By composting your pet’s poop, you sidestep all of these harmful impacts and instead turn your ‘waste’ into a valuable resource that’s actually good for our planet. Correctly composted pet poo becomes a rich natural fertiliser, full of organic matter, which feeds your soil and in turn leads to healthy, thriving plants. Oh, and it helps sequester carbon and keeps ecosystems and climate healthier, too. Composting manure from herbivores (animals that only eat plants) is really simple – you just add it to your usual composting situation or worm farm. This matured compost is safe to be used anywhere in your garden, including on your veggie patch. Check out our Beginners Guide to Composting for full details on how to set up a normal composting system, including a list of what you can use as carbon elements to balance out the nitrogen in your animal’s poop. You can also process herbivore waste along with your own food scraps in a worm farm – our Beginners Guide to Worm Farming article will help you get started. When it comes to manure from omnivores and carnivores (animals that eat some or only meat), you need to take a bit more care with composting your pets poo. You can’t just throw cat poo into your main compost pile, or dig dog poo straight into your veggie garden. This is because poo from omnivorous and carnivorous animals, such as dogs and cats, may contain harmful bacteria and parasites that can make you sick. But that doesn’t mean you can’t safely compost and use dog and cat poo at home! You just need to create a system completely separate from any other compost situations you might have going on. So let’s look at two options that are great for different reasons in different contexts – the separate compost bin and the separate worm farm. Note: ‘compostable’ pet poo bags aren’t always actually compostable, and even if they are, they slow things down. So – first find out in your bags ARE actually compostable, and if they’re not, make the switch. Then – as Florence and the Machine says – shake it out. Lastly, add your compostable pet poo bag to that same compost or worm farm, separately. Set yourself up with two black compost bins that sits directly atop the soil – they’re easy to source and super simple to use. Choose a location that’s separate from your annual veggie patch; under your fruit trees or in the non-edible part of your garden is good. Designate these as your ‘pet poo bins’: the only spot you’ll add your dog or cat poo. Keeping them separate means they won’t accidentally interact with your other compost at any point. Compost produced from this pet waste-only bin system won’t be suitable for use on your veggie patch. But it will be great for fertilising fruit trees and non-edible plantings. Similarly, you could create a separate worm farm to process your dog and cat poop – yes, worms will eat your pet waste! This is an excellent small-space gardening option. Choose a worm farm system that’s contained so it doesn’t touch the soil, which helps prevent any possible cross-contamination with parasites that may be in your pet’s poo.  Compost produced from this pet waste-only worm farm won’t be suitable for use on your veggie patch. But it will be great for fertilising fruit trees and non-edible plantings. It’s really important to remember that compost made with dog and cat waste simply can’t be used in or near any food gardens – it could pose a danger to your health. Cats are the only definitive hosts for the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which can cause Toxoplasmosis, an infection that is dangerous to foetuses, and native wildlife. This parasite can’t be eradicated through home composting. While dogs aren’t Toxoplasma gondii hosts, they can still be infected by it. Plus, some parasites and bacteria in dog waste – including E. coli, salmonella and several types of worms such as ringworm and tapeworm – can live in the soil for years. But… even though your composted dog or cat poo isn’t great (like, at all) for your veggies, it’s still beneficial for your soil and a great resource, if used in the right spot. Once it has finished composting, bury your mature cat or dog poo compost in your orchard beneath fruit trees, or within ornamental garden beds. Then add a thick layer of mulch on top. This reduces the likelihood of local wildlife being exposed to it. And in future, when gardening in this spot, wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly with soap afterwards.  A word of warning – if you have used ‘de-worming’ medication on your pets, this can kill the earthworms and other helpful life in your compost bin or worm farm, too. So, it’s best to wait a week after worming before adding any new poo to your composting system. What to do with your pet’s waste in those three days? If your council offers an organic waste collection, you can add pet waste to this green bin. Wrap it in some newspaper or a compostable bag first to help prevent unpleasant smells. The high heat generated during the council’s commercial composting process kills pathogens, meaning compost made from green bin waste is safe to use in all areas of the garden, including veggie patches. Kitty litter made from stone, clay or crystals/silica is not compostable and must be placed into landfill – which we’re trying to avoid! Instead, choose kitty litter made from % paper, sawdust or wood pellets. These break down quickly and also help add some carbon to your compost system. If you have access to dry sawdust, you can even make your own natural kitty litter. This will break down much more quickly compared to shop-bought litter products. If your pet’s poo is sealed in a completely compostable poo bag, you should still be able to add it to your compost, bag and all. (It probably can’t be added to your worm farm though.) But note that the compostability of these bags varies between brands, and some are more dodgy than others. Bags labelled ‘degradable’ or ‘biodegradable’ are very often just plastic bags subjected to green-washed marketing. They won’t turn into soil in your compost, but they may break down into even smaller pieces of plastic (not good). So do your research and find the most compostable bags possible! Alrighty, lovely – time to turn that dog poop into nutrient-rich compost!

"We all know that dahlias are delicious to the eye and the heart, but also – great news! Dahlias (Acocoxochitl) are edible. Flower and tuber. Hooray. However, as with many edible plants… there’s edible, and then there’s tasty. All dahlias are edible, which is a great starting point for experimenting with. And some varieties are delicious, which is even better. Dahlias come in abundant diversity… because of the type of plant that they are, and also because their seeds don’t grow true to type – which means that folks have been breeding new dahlia cultivars for a very long time. This also means you can grow new varieties of new dahlias yourself, if you steward and propagate their seeds well. Couple this diversity with the fact that our knowledge on how dahlias were first used in Mexico is patchy because of colonisation and attempted cultural erasure… there’s plenty of learning to do here, in order to add dahlias to your list of resilient, perennial edible plants to grow in your garden. After hearing that dahlias were edible, I went and looked it up. I couldn’t easily find much on dahlia’s edibility, save a few scientific papers confirming this was so. So I went digging. And it turns out, worldwide, there are A LOT of dedicated Dahlia Societies. Dahlias are A Thing, for many folks. There is even heated debate. And contested knowledge, and histories. And many, many, many cultivars. But not, so far as I could find, many folks outside of Mexico that are actually eating dahlias. Which is weird, to me, because who doesn’t want to grow a mind-blowingly-beautiful-flower whose tubers you can also EAT in winter? And make delicious ice cream, lemonade, and quesadillas with? I mean, sign me up. Seriously. So – here is some of the useful resources around dahlias and their edibility that i found. Please hit me up if you have a resource to add. Dahlias are indigenous to Mexico, and continue to grow wild and also be actively cultivated (both for beauty, food, ceremony and medicine) there. There’s at least  varieties of dahlia listed as native to Mexico, and some of these were cultivated by many peoples, including the Aztec/Mexica. Original names in Nahuatl include Acocoxochitl “flower of hollow stems with water” – atl (water), cocotli (tube) and xochitl (flower) and also Chichipatli “bitter medicine” – chichic (bitter) and patli (medicine). There’s plenty of histories of the dahlia that focus on the Spanish invader/coloniser’s records – but when it comes to their edibility and uses, most of these are, frankly, a bit disparaging and patchy. The dahlia seems to have a contested history – some scholars think it was featured in petroglyphs and held up as important and sacred, others contest that marigolds were the main flower featured, and dahlias were a minor element. Either way, the dahlia ended up as the national flower of Mexico. Most of these english-language histories focus on the dahlia varieties from an aesthetic perspective – very few focus on (or even mention) their edibility and medicinal uses. I suspect this doesn’t actually indicate how much dahlias were eaten in Mexico, but does indicate that the colonizers were interested in the dahlia as an exotic, gorgeous trophy plant, which was easily transportable via it’s tubers back to Europe. A similar thing happened with tomatoes – which were brought back from Mexico only to be used as ornamental plants for hundreds of years in Europe, before their deliciousness was ‘discovered’. Hmm. So – the way that selective histories, selective fact gathering, and colonisation can attempt to erase culture needs to be noted, here. And because further and successive ‘histories’ of the dahlia have been based on those patchy spanish records, and because, outside of Mexico, dahlia varieties have been actively selected for beauty rather than nourishment for a few hundred years, we’re now left with a ‘you could eat them, but probably don’t bother‘ vibe, when it comes to dahlias. Which I’m sure you’ve heard before, when it comes to an indigenous food and medicine plant that has been downgraded and de-prioritised by empire, for a range of reasons. Time to de-colonise the dahlia! Or at least work on de-colonising our relationship with this amazing plant – by learning more about how to use its gifts. The dahlias themselves, like the culture and peoples that they come from, continue to blossom, remember, adapt, grow, and give. However – surprise – there’s plenty of Mexican resources on how dahlias have been and continue to be used as food in Mexico that I found during my research, which don’t seem to have made it into the various Dahlia Societies histories. Here’s a few of the resources I found on that front: While all dahlias are edible (sofar as I could find), it seems some are more delicious than others. This is to be expected with a plant that readily diversifies, and one which, again, has been bred for looks rather than nourishment for the last few hundred years, outside of Mexico. Consistently, however, the flower and the tuber is the most used part. I have also eaten the leaves of dahlias from my garden, with no ill-effects, but that’s not exactly definitive as to their edibility. Historically, the varieties most identified as being used for cooking are what is now known as the Common Garden Dahlia (D. x pinnata or D. variabilis) and the Red Dahlia (D. coccinea). Jose Mejia of the Mexican Dahlia Association specifies that the Red Dahlia (D. coccinea) is the variety most cultivated for eating in Mexico, currently. So – to begin with the eating of them… here’s what the Slow Food Foundation for Biodiversity has to say about Acocoxochitle (Dahlia). Dahlia flowers have been and continue to be extensively used in salads, drinks and syrups in Mexico – their flavours range from sweet to bland to spicy. This study found that various dahlia flowers, especially the darker coloured ones, contained useful amounts of antioxidants. Dahlia flowers, added whole, would also be a fine (and beautiful) addition to any wild soda that you chose to ferment. Dahlias grow from an edible, starchy tuber which can be eaten and enjoyed either raw or cooked. They’re full of inulin, which is helpful both to folks with diabetes, and also in its prevention, as it lowers blood glucose levels. Inulin is also a great pre-biotic, so helps your gut process other foods better by supporting your gut biota. Dahlia tubers are (within their variability) also a good source of potassium, riboflavin, and vitamin B, and contains copper and manganese as well. In short, dahlia tubers are very good for you. Typically, tubers are always peeled first, no matter how they’re prepared, as the skin is quite bitter. The deliciousness of particular tubers varies widely! Some are sweet-ish, some more bland, some are bitter. And the flavours change with storage and become sweeter as the inulin converts to fructose, as outlined here. Keep in mind – outside of Mexico, dahlias have been bred and cultivated for nearly  years for their flowers, exclusively, not the taste of their tubers. So it’s no surprise that we now have MANY amazing dahlias that don’t necessarily taste great. But that doesn’t mean that some of them aren’t still delicious! So as mentioned above, the varieties most identified as being used for cooking are what is now known as the Common Garden Dahlia (D. x pinnata or D. variabilis) and the Red Dahlia (D. coccinea). Both of these have a single row of petals. There is also the yellow gem dahlia that’s recommended by Cultivariable as a good eater – this is a ‘pom pom’ type of dahlia, with petals in a Fibonacci whirl. So – what to dahlia tubers taste like? Kinda like a water chestnut crossed with a yacon crossed with celery, but with the ability to sweeten and enhance flavors too And super duper good for your blood sugar, and your biome. Hooray! The species that are cultivated for eating have tubers that are crunchy, like a water chestnut or yacon – both when raw, and also when cooked lightly. Cooking for longer softens them, and they’re also often used in a paste-form, to heighten other flavours. There’s a wide range of recipes below, but in short, they’re eaten in raw slices with seasoning, in cooked chunks as a crunchy addition to all kinds of dishes from gratin to quesadillas, as a paste in ice cream, with fish, and more. Then there’s the syrups and lemonades that folks make with dahlia tubers as well. Given their similarity in texture and inulin to jerusalem artichokes, you could use a jerusalem artichoke pickle recipe and substitute for dahlia tubers. Our friend down the road, Bud, has been pickling dahlia tubers for years this way, and speaks highly of them. There’s also a syrup made from the tubers called Dacopa, which is apparently still drunk in Mexico (There was also a coffee-substitute manufactured from dahlia tubers called Dacopa for a while – it din’t take off). And these folks are making Chichicpatli, a dahlia beer. Multiple of these recipes refer to a book Recetario Flores de Dalia which I believe is by Jose Mejia of the Mexican Dahlia / Acocoxochitl Association. Here’s a snippet from “Recetario Flores de Dalia”, translated by True Love Seeds, which is a great staring point – “First clean the tubers, remove the small roots, boil them for - minutes, and peel off their skin. From there, you have several options: you can make cubes and add them to carrots and peas in a rice dish; cut and fry them like French fries; add milk, butter, salt, and pepper and puree them like mashed potatoes; or add them to a puree of eggplant and tomatoes, Middle Eastern style. For older, more traditional uses, you can cook cubed dahlias in honey and cinnamon. For a savory pancake, mix dahlia petals, cooked and chopped quelites (wild spinach), eggs (turkey or chicken), flour, grated cheese, and salt, make into patties, and fry in oil. You can also place the tubers in the middle of agave leaves (or alone) and cook in embers for an hour and eat with a little salt.” Dahlias have been traditionally used to treat a range of skin and internal ailments, and are mentioned as such in the spanish records. Dahlia variabilis has been recorded as being use for a diuretic, diaphoretic, anti-colic, anti-flatulent, anti-tuberculosis. Dahlia coccinea is recorded as being used for a tonic, diuretic, diaphoretic, anti-colic, anti-flatulent. Here’s the best roundup article of Dahlias as medicinals that I could find, and there’s plenty of studies and papers on the tubers inulin and the petals antioxidant properties, also. Keen to grow some delicious dahlias? Here’s a few great resources to get you started – I hope this is enough info for you to be inspired, go forth and cultivate (and also eat) as many Dahlia / Acocoxochitl varieties as you can get your hands on. Because our gardens and neighbourhoods need all the resilient storage crops, that are also delicious and versatile, that we can possibly fit in – both for our household’s, and our whole community’s nourishement, health and future. Add to that pollinator support, so much history, medicine, culture, resistance, and endless variable beauty in their varieties… I think it’s time to thank the dahlias, and their seed-keepers, who have stewarded this incredible, generous plant so very well, for so very long. Long may the Acocoxochitl and their people bloom. And may we learn well from the dahlia’s many teachings and gifts, and join them. Big thanks to all the knowledge keepers whose experience I was able to access for this article, both past and present. Big thanks to Veggie & Flower Garden Seeds for the use of their dahlia photos. All other photo sources indicated under images.     ";Milkwood
Alrighty – Habits for Hope, here we go (what is this? Go here to learn more about the series)… Let’s start with what we see as an utterly essential habit for everyone – learning the story of the Country that you’re on. This usually means learning whose land you are on, and learning how to show respect for and solidarity with Indigenous people and Country where you live, and beyond. Why is this habit so important? Because showing respect for First Nations people and the Country that has been stewarded by them for millennia, and which currently nurtures you, each and everyday of your life, is fundamental to permaculture ethics, and also to showing up as a good human. Taking on this habit helps create more equity and justice – for people, and for country. We know that learning from, raising up and practicing indigenous knowledge, science and land practices hold key ways to mitigate the climate crisis, as well as adapt to rapid change. Also – globally, Indigenous people make up less than % of the world’s population, but they manage and protect % of global biodiversity. And for these crucial knowledge-ways to be acknowledged, protected and utilized, they need our individual and community-level support, which includes a working understanding of the story of the country we are on. This habit also has the effect of helping to connect YOU to the Country that you’re on, just that little bit more – which can only be a good thing. If you’ve lived where you are for a while, perhaps you already know this story – or maybe it’s YOUR Country. Or maybe, if you’re like us, you’ve moved around a lot. There are many ways to learn your land’s story – here’s some starting ideas: Do some research and find out who are the Indigenous people of the place you call home, and the name of the language they speak. Write these name/s down, and put that on your fridge so you see it regularly. Also, research the history of the land that you live on, and what’s happened from first point of contact (if the land you’re on was colonized) up until now. Which people arrived here? When? What treaties were made or broken here? When was that? Where are those people now? Research the original names of the places where you live, and any other landmarks that you can find reference to – mountains, rivers, beaches, plains. Write all those names down on a map of your local area. If these are publicly available and it’s culturally appropriate, start using those names. Find the closest Indigenous organisation to you – they may have online or in-house resources that you can access to help with your research. They may also have events you can attend, to learn more about where you live, from their perspective. Educate yourself on what has happened, on the land where you live, to Indigenous people – from when they stopped being the only people of your country (eg from the point of colonisation, if that’s the story of your area) till now. Be real about it. Don’t look away. Seek to understand what has happened, and what is still happening. This is often a dark story, but it’s important to understand what has gone before, to create the place where you live, now. Read books by Indigenous writers, seek out documentaries about history like Australian Wars. If you live on stolen land, it’s time to give back in a way that makes life better for others. This land nurtures you, each and every day, thanks to the long, long stewardship of First Peoples. Find out how to Pay the Rent (also called Indigenous Land Tax) where you live. We’ll step you though this excellent habit in a few weeks time, but here’s a primer. Use your knowledge. Share what you’ve learned with your family and friends. Initiate discussion on these topics. Get involved in reconciliation processes or other campaigns lead by Indigenous people nearby. And a small-but powerful daily practice, once you know whose land you’re on: you can add the traditional place name of the country that you’re on to your postal address. In Australia, putting the country that you’re on between your name and the first line of your address is the recommended way to do this, according to AusPost. A note that this came about via a successful campaign by Place Names in Adresses and allies (yay). This article is part of our Habits for Hope series. A huge range of actions, practices, habits and good ideas for you to consider folding into your daily life. Some ideas are big, and some are small. All of them with the ability to shift worlds, and cultivate community, and also Make Life Better, at your place. It’s based on a snippet from our latest book, The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook – Habits for Hope in a changing world – which is itself a companion guide to the Permaculture Living course, which we teach and mentor a class of students through, each season…. …to help skill folks up in hands-on habits, actions and projects that can make life better at your place – and also co-create the futures our communities need, starting today.

"I’m going to start off here with an extract from the intro section of our latest book The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook – I’ll explain why later – let’s dive straight in. Habits, hope and connection – how can we use the first one to create more of the other two? Cultivating connection gives our lives meaning and, importantly, places us in relationship – to each other, to land and to other animals and plants. These relationships require reciprocity, attention and care. These relationships also change us. In this time of ever-escalating and overlapping crises, the health of our ecosystems, our communities and other communities far beyond ours urgently requires us to engage and connect. We know we have to do something, and keep doing it. We know that grassroots movements can change the world. We also know the problems we collectively face are very big and it’s all incredibly daunting. Despite all of this, you may want to ask, ‘How can I become self-sufficient, hole up here and never go out again?’ I’d like to suggest that your ongoing health and resilience – indeed your entire future – lies not in the goal of self-sufficiency, or some bunker mentality where the outside world is no longer connected to you, but rather in re-establishing and creating more connection instead. Connections to your ecosystem and connections to your community. We need the plants, places and people around us to thrive. Disconnection – from land, from the people who produce our goods, from our food and from each other – is partly what got us into this mess to start with. So, if the urge to establish a mini-fortress (in your backyard or in your heart) in response to the huge problems we face isn’t the best way through this… what can we do, starting from where we are? We’ve been asked these questions for decades by permaculture students searching for answers, and the best answer I can give – informed by many thinkers, knowledge-ways, elders and my own experience – is this: the more we can each live in relationship and reciprocity with our ecosystems, and the more we can incorporate connection and meaning into our everyday life through our choices and habits (even if those choices feel tiny against the world’s problems), the more connection and purpose we can infuse into our lives. And the more we can cultivate connection, meaning and purpose in our lives, the more we are able to cultivate hope. A grounding in hope can support us to take action, even when the problems we face seem, at times, overwhelming. I am not talking about whimsical hope here, pinning our hope on a fancy. I’m talking about tough, robust, active hope. Hope that is cultivated by action. Hope is a powerful place to be coming from when it comes to endurance and action. In fact, unless you’re going to be motivated purely from a place of fear (which I don’t recommend, if you can avoid it), hope is essential to action. And, as in the cycles of our ecosystems, there’s a feedback loop here, too. Just as hope leads to action, action in turn leads to more hope. It’s this momentum that will propel us forward. But what does hope look like in urgent times, in the face of the scale of our collective challenges and the smallness of our everyday lives? It looks like the things that make up our days: our habits, our choices, our actions, our chores, our work, and our rest and downtime, too. Day in, day out, our lives are full of actions and habits: some conscious and many unconscious. What if your habits could help create a better world, just a little bit at a time, while you went about your normal day? They can. Your habits can allow you to translate your hopes for the world you want into your everyday life. Habits are how you eat your eggs, or how you make your coffee, or what you drink, or don’t, or how you get to work and back again. But habits can also be a powerful vote for resilience and justice and small-but- significant acts of defiance. Habits are slow, flying in the face of our current culture, and can be used to resist, and revolt, and reimagine more just and lovely worlds. Habits can help us imagine and create the worlds that we need, and the futures that we need. Starting right at your breakfast table, before you’ve even started your day. At best, habits can transform your life, and help change the world – on the small scale and on the large. At worst, habits can be insidious things that damage your body and your mind. And beyond you, they can uphold unjust regimes, reinforce racism, oppress peoples and deplete landscapes and futures. Simply put, habits are powerful. So let’s invite better ones into our lives, and create new worlds with more justice and abundance and hope. One little habit and one little step at a time. But how to get started with habits that are truly world-changing? And how do you ground yourself and create resolve to keep going in the face of so much grief, challenge and change? Happily, there’s many design and thinking systems that can help us chart a course forward to the futures we need. One of them is permaculture, which we explain here… We live in unprecedented times – or so we’re often told these days. The negative effects of hundreds of years of industrialisation, colonialism and capitalism on our planet are now completely undeniable: scarred landscapes and hurting soils; cultures, languages, lives and wisdom lost to the violence of colonisation; depleted water tables; species gone forever; civil unrest; even the air we breathe with its rising levels of carbon dioxide. I know it’s easy to feel like you’re living at the end of the world, right now. And on top of all that, we’re fed the message that the environmental devastation and the plastic bags choking our oceans are our fault, as individuals; that the reason these problems exist is that we didn’t try hard enough, or turn off our lights when we left the room, or we drove our cars more than we should, or we forgot our reusable cups again. This individualised blame fits neatly into an individualised culture and has been deliberately cultivated by the fossil-fuel giants to distract us from their climate wrecking. So, I want to be very clear here at the start of this book: the responsibility for the environmental and cultural devastation of our Earth and peoples rests primarily with the huge companies and unjust power structures in our societies – from imperialism to multinationals – that have consistently, over hundreds of years, put power and profit before people and ecosystems. And then, as if that wasn’t audaciously evil enough, these same industries have created massive marketing campaigns to place the responsibility to ‘do the right thing’ entirely on you – the end user – rather than owning their impact as the cause of so much harm, all in the name of power and profit. There’s plenty to get angry about with this global gaslighting. And I believe you should be angry; exercise your democratic rights and do whatever else you can to hold the systems and powers that created this complete mess to account. Grassroots movements of people joining together can change the world for the better: they have done before and will do again. However, everything is connected, and what each of us does matters, especially when it’s combined with what others are doing. This forms the foundation of connected, collective action: these small actions (or habits, if you’re doing them regularly) can create powerful networks and systems. We need collective power, and we need to work together. Thousands of small acts create positive change. Look at nationwide, citizen-led projects of renewal, fossil-fuel divestment movements, workers’ picket lines and the school climate strikes. Look at our previous successes, such as when ordinary workers banded together to push for an eight-hour work day and an end to child labour in the face of huge, profit-focused opposition. It wasn’t thought possible, until ordinary people began working together and forced the change. We are all individuals, not corporations, so we can only ever do small individual acts. But when done with others in community, these small acts create movements, can shift power bases, make new futures possible and change everything. So, yes – you have responsibilities to your ecosystem and your community, now and always. But that’s not the same as being the cause of this enormous mess that we’re all in, or bearing the guilt for it. That is not on you. And yet, we must each participate in finding the solutions to these massive challenges. This part is on you, as a member of your ecosystem and your community. The power structures that created this damage and injustice are not going to suddenly dismantle themselves, or spontaneously repair the damage they have caused. In reciprocating the gift of being alive and nourished by this incredible Earth, we must all be part of the solutions our planet and ecosystems need, right now. So being a good ancestor is about understanding the sources of the damage, and using your vote and your body and your words and your head and your heart to stand up alongside others and effect change, as part of whichever movements, petitions, marches, creative interventions, campaigns or class actions you choose, or whatever is within your abilities to participate in and show up for. Another part of being a good ancestor is figuring out how to live your days in between the protests and the big actions in a way that sustains and nourishes you, while creating as little harm as you can. You can fight the powers that be and also choose to live like it matters – wherever you live. You can take big action and also practise accountability in your daily habits. You can resist, defend and help create a new world and also practise gratitude for the ecosystem you live in by tending to the reciprocity required of you by your local soils, waters and other living things. These traumatic times call for living with intention and with care, to ensure we can keep going while keeping our heads on straight and our hearts open. It’s hard. Fortunately, your ecosystem has a lot of wisdom on this ‘how to keep going in unprecedented times’ front, and can really help you out if you’re willing to learn from it. There is so much to be thankful for. Our ecosystems are so generous to us, even as they’re hurting and changing. They’re committed to life, and you get to be a part of that generosity. You will be part of your ecosystem each day of your life. You owe the simple fact that there’s oxygen for you to breathe to the plants and algae around you. Your daily sustenance depends on the soil, plants, insects and animals of both your ecosystem and other ecosystems far beyond. With this residency of yours comes a life lived in relation to the plants, animals, microbes, water and people in your ecosystem, whether you know their names or not. City or country, it doesn’t matter. The life of your ecosystem is all around you and inside you – it is you. You’re part of it all, and it’s helping to sustain your every breath, meal and movement. So, how will you choose to live – at this time on Earth, with all our collective problems, in this damaged-but-still-generous ecosystem in which you find yourself? Will you live in a way that cultivates a sense of reciprocity and belonging? Would you like to live your days in a way that creates minimal harm, while contributing purposefully to a more positive future for you, your household, your community and all the life around you? This is big stuff. And it is also the smallest stuff.  The above is an extract from the intro section of our latest book The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook, which is itself a partner to the Permaculture Living course, which we teach  times a year. In addition to these in-depth resources, we felt it might be useful to share some of these habits on a weekly basis – as a prompt of sorts – for you to think about, and then go on to learn more about in whatever way suits you… So! From here on in, we’re going to be sharing a series of Habits for Hope, for you to try out. A huge range of actions, practices and good ideas. Some big, some small. All of them with the ability to shift worlds, and cultivate community, and also Make Life Better, at your place. They’re snippets from our latest book, The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook. But all these ideas belong to all of us, and always have. We are co-creating the future every day of our lives, and we can do that in a way that creates more equity, more justice, more deliciousness, and which leans towards life – each and every day. We’ll file all these habits under the Habits for Hope category, which will grow over the next year. We can’t wait to see which ones resonate for you, to help you lean towards life, a little more each day x If you would like future articles like this sent straight to your inbox, you can subscribe here.

Growing mushrooms at home in a hot summer is entirely possible, and it can actually increase your household and backyard resilience (and nutrition!) in all kinds of ways – it’s all about working with the seasons, and designing different functions to work together. Quite doable, in any backyard. From providing a diverse harvest for your household in wonky weather, to helping cool your house and actively support your bushfire preparedness, mushroom cultivation can play it’s part, while providing you with delish mushrooms now, and with the promise of future harvests once the heat recedes. This is not to say that hotter summers, fuelled by climate change, are not heartbreaking in every way. However – here we all are, in this world, in this mess, together. And as well as direct action and all the things we can and must do, we also need to keep growing, and tending, and showing up for… The soil beneath our feet. The gardens that help sustain our hearts, and households. Our local food systems. So – how can we help increase our household and community resilience, with mushrooms? It’s all about stacking functions, re-thinking location, keeping that all-important moisture up, choosing the best species for the job, and a few extra hacks that we’ll show you. We sometimes think of mushrooms as the kind of thing that stays in one spot – but in fact, mushrooms are some of the ultimate explorers, and they love to move around – preferably with a bit of help. The mushroom fruiting body is gorgeously designed to both fling it’s spores far and wide, and is also designed to be picked up and moved around by animals (including humans, sometimes), to further distribute their spores – which is why so many mushroom species are so darn tasty. Ontop of that, the mycelial networks of fungi can travel surprising distances underneath the surface of mulch and soil, while supporting the soil food web as they travel, in order to find the best spot to fruit into mushrooms. Mushrooms LOVE to move around, in their own way. So – by actively moving your mushroom logs, garden material or buckets and jars around to better locations, to ensure they continue to thrive throughout a hot summer – you’re actually behaving a lot like mycelium, and becoming an increasingly functional part of your surrounding ecosystem. The mushrooms have trained us well. Yes, let’s talk bushfire preparedness. Because that’s a part of summer. Every household needs to think about this anyway, so why not incorporate a yield of mushrooms into that design? The thing is, with mushrooms, moisture is key. When growing in buckets, this contained space makes maintaining moisture levels relatively easy (yay) which is why we often recommend these techniques for beginners. For outside cultivation, though – the mycelium in your mushroom logs and mushroom gardens IS very resilient, but both these types of mycelium need to have some level of moisture to incubate slowly, and a healthy level of moisture to thrive. In a hot summer there’s going to be sections of your garden that you try extra hard to keep watered and cool – for your own health and happiness, to maintain precious plants, but also for bushfire preparedness. So start thinking about how to incorporate your mushroom logs and gardens into THOSE spaces, over summer. As part of any resilient household, catching rainwater and using greywater are excellent options to consider – and the implementation of these ideas can be super simple. Catching and storing rainwater is prettymuch always a good idea – it means more water for you when you need it, even if your rainwater is recommended for garden-use only. Catch it! Store it! Use it! I’ve included a bunch of simple hacks for catching and storing both rainwater and grey water in the resources of this article. In any climate that experiences low humidity in the warmer months, adding moisture near to your house can drastically reduce the temperature of that zone in summer, and therefore increase your own comfort, as well as being a great growing space for plants (and fungi!), and a refuge for other species too. Humidity can be added with a simple misting system, more shady plants, or even just a small pond. Any water-based (or plant based) system near your house that brings the humidity up, will help bring the temperature down – and there’s so many positive flow-on effects from that – less energy costs, better growing space, happier humans, and, potentially as a side-effect, more mushrooms. This might be in a shady section outside your front door, which can then be opened to let that cooler air into the house. Win-win. Using one or more of these techniques, you’ll be keeping your household as prepared as possible, keeping a bit of green around you to keep your heart whole, and, by design, nurturing your future mushroom harvests as well. It’s working with what you have, to increase resilience for all the species in your garden. If you’ve got an inoculated mushroom log or two, or a whole stack, move the stack somewhere shady and cool in readiness for a hot summer. Perhaps you located your mushroom logs in this kind of location already (good job!), but either way – stop a moment and consider… ‘am I going to prioritise keeping this area moist over summer?’ If the answer is ‘mmm maybe not’, then figure out which shaded section of your yard you WILL prioritise keeping moist and well watered over summer, and relocate your mushroom logs there. This part of your garden might be your firebreak, where you’ve specifically planted fire-retardant trees. Or it might be a much-loved section of your garden that nutures you (and your garden’s ecosystem) with it’s green shade and abundance, which you are going to prioritise if water restrictions come into place. Stack those functions! In this way, you’ll be able to keep your mushroom logs moist by default when you water this section of garden, it’s one less garden job to stress you out in the heat of summer, AND your autumn and winter harvest of shiitakes, lions mane, oyster mushrooms or whatever else you’ve inoculated those logs with, will be assured. A note on your log stack – pack it tightly and low to the ground over summer – this will help with retaining moisture, while the mycelium slowly colonises the logs. The open stacking that is used for the fruiting phase is not for this season! Do that re-stacking into an open, harvestable format in autumn, when the dropping temperatures and Autumn rains will trigger fruiting. This is the season where you can expect a flush of shiitake mushrooms. Another hack you can incorporate here – you can get a specific mushroom log blanket that holds moisture in, while allowing the logs to breathe (airflow is important). It’s not as picturesque as a cute stack of logs, but it helps a lot with their moisture levels. If your log location is less than ideal, covering them with hessian bags, shade cloth or geotextile will also help. Firstly, figure out which shady parts of your garden you’re going to prioritise keeping watered over a hot summer. Maybe it’s the areas around your most precious fruit trees, or similar. Are your mushroom garden patches in that part of your garden already? If so – yay. Water away, and expect mushrooms in the Autumn. If your mushroom garden is not in a spot that you know will be kept moist over summer, you can: Mulch your mushroom garden extra deep, and water well over spring – the mushroom mycelium will retreat downwards, towards the available moisture, but should be ok – water every few weeks to ensure it makes it through. This will also benefit the trees and plants that share your mushroom patch, making for more life and resilience in your garden ecosystem. Move your mushroom garden to a shadier, more moist location. Ergh, yes, I know. BUT – in Australia, we’re looking at x El Nino hot summers in a row coming our way. So if you’re going to move your mushroom patches to a better, shadier, more moist location, now is a good time to do that. To move your mushroom garden: prep a new site as per our Mushroom garden instructions, then carefully move your patch to that location with a big flat shovel, in chunks (keep the layers as intact as you can – don’t upend anything), add some extra pasteurised woodchip on top, and water it all in well. A note of encouragement – mushroom gardens are super resilient – partly because most of what they do is underground. And in a bushfire season – which hopefully doesn’t contain an actual bushfire near your place, but who knows – we need more underground garden patches that can survive and pop up with nutrient-dense food to feed us all, after the summer is done. Also – the more mycelium in your garden, the better your entire garden can cope with heat – mycelium distributes and retains lots of moisture, both for it’s own needs and for the benefits of surrounding plants. So the more mycelium you have in your garden… the better for everyone, and everything – especially in a hot summer. Which is yet another way that mushroom gardens can be an important part of building your household and backyard resilience. Thank you, mycelium. As mentioned above, bucket cultivation is a great beginner growing technique partly because the container makes for easy humidity and moisture control during the incubation phase. While you’ll continue to incubate your summer buckets somewhere with a stable room temp between - degrees celcius, the same as you would at other times of year – do be aware that warmer weather may speed up the incubation time. So check your buckets or jars regularly during warmer weather! For fruiting your buckets well in hot weather – humidity is key, along with airflow. So finding somewhere consistently humid which also has good airflow is the trick here. So – back to the bit about how huge a help humidity can be in hot weather to cool your inside and outside spaces…. get your fruiting buckets involved in this setup, if you can! If you have a small outside shaded area that you can setup misters in, this the the perfect place to fruit your summer buckets of shrooms. Other ideas for fruiting buckets and jars in hot weather: Also – have a think about what species you can grow in buckets this summer – you might be able to try some warmer-climate ones than you’re used to. Adapting to the changing climate that you have, with which species you grow, this year and into the future, is a core part of household and community resilience. These home-scale techniques work hand-in-hand with supporting direct action for climate justice and halting all fossil fuel projects, of course! Summer can be a BIG HARVEST time for the warmth-loving oyster species, so this is a perfect season to grow tonnes of nutrient dense mushrooms. Once harvested, you can eat them and swap them straight-up, but also pickle them or dry them for eating in later seasons, and share some of your yield with those beyond your fenceline, to make life better for everyone. You can find details of our favourite species to grow in our top  mushrooms to grow at home article – including fruiting temperatures and what substrates to grow the mushrooms on. Identify which parts of your garden you’re going to prioritise keeping shady, cool and green in hot weather – and fold your mushroom cultivation into those areas. Catch, store and use all the rainwater that you can – in tanks, buckets, and in the biology, mycelium, deep mulch and rain-garden features of your yard. The more water stored in your system over summer, the better for all life – including your home-grown mushrooms. Redirect all the grey water that you can to be a useful input in your garden – perfect for fire-resistant plantings along your perimeter (which leads to more humidity in your yard) and for your mushroom gardens, too. Consider setting up a simple, small misting system somewhere outside a suitable window/door to keep things green and thriving, to let that cool air into your house, and fruit your mushrooms there, as a bonus outcome. Coming up to summer is an excellent time to start growing some heat-loving mushrooms – and can diversify your food supply dramatically, even when the weather is unpredictable. Remember that the more different food and medicine crops we have growing in our backyards and beyond, at all times of year, the more diverse, stable and resilient our home and community food systems can become.

"“The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook is a guide to improving your home, health and happiness – and the planet – one simple step at a time.
Packed with meaningful action for the everyday, it’s full of practical skills and projects – regenerative living for busy people who want to make a positive impact in a world out of balance.” So sayeth our new book’s cover. Because it’s important to go-in-softly, in book land, if you want to bring as many people as possible along with you… from learning to pickle, all the way to organising collectively, in order to change everything. Because this book IS about how to pickle and plant things. It’s true. But/and also… This book is about rethinking how your individual actions can help create community resilience and radical change, within your ordinary daily habits. As you can imagine, heathy ecosystems have been found to be far more resilient to climate change. And also… healthy nervous systems have been found to be far more resilient to climate change. Huh. Makes sense, right? And so – we each need to find ongoing, burned-into-our-daily-life ways that we can nurture both our ecosystem, and our nervous system… while we organise and act for climate justice. How we can tweak and activate our daily actions to support our own nervous systems, in order to live in a way that creates more meaning and purpose for ourselves, while also contributing to the collective change that we all need? There is enormous urgency, and very present crises that we must all participate to finding solutions in. But also – we are, at the same time, soft animals that need to find more ways to reclaim our living relationship with our ecosystems – if we are to live through this time, and pass crucial knowledge forwards to those that come after us. Part of reclaiming this right relationship with your ecosystem is joining your local climate action group. And another essential part of this is considering deeply how we live, and how we can live better, in a way that leans towards life in all that we do. And this book is a gentle handbook to get you started with that, one step at a time. I have to say – at times, it does feel strange, in a way, to be advocating for a ‘one step at a time’ approach in a time of such urgency. But this is also how we’ll get there. From how we consume to how we grow food to how we interact and organise within our communities, to how we interact and live in relationship to our watersheds, and our ecosystems. For many of us, coming out of a consumer perspective, all of that change can seem pretty overwhelming. But that’s exactly why a one step at a time approach can be so valuable, for so many of us. This book is to help you move forward, one action at a time, out of despair and overwhelm, and towards the futures our communities need, and deserve. How can we cultivate everyday habits that help create more justice, more biodiversity, more collective action, and more of the the world we want – amidst our everyday life, with our everyday choices? How can we create more meaning in our daily life, in a way that actually makes a difference, in this time of urgent and overlapping crises? What if your habits could create a more meaningful life for you AND a better world? MASSIVE SPOILER – your daily habits can help do just this! While making life more delicious and purposeful for you, in the process. So this is a book that draws on permaculture design, and practices like active hope, to help you get started with the reality of what happens to your body, your ecosystem and your community when you decide to engage more deeply in leaning towards life, with your everyday choices. You can use this handbook purely to learn ways to make pickles, compost, or to get to know your neighbours – and if that’s the limit of what you think you have the capacity to do right now, when it comes to changing things up, that’s awesome! But also… “This book is about using permaculture thinking to bring small new habits and practices into your daily life that will have meaningful, positive effects. Both in ways that you can clearly feel, enjoy and benefit from, and in other ways, with effects that may be beyond your understanding, but are no less powerful for that. Because how we live our days – from what we eat to what we advocate for – creates our relationship with our ecosystem as well as our community, and with our selves. This book is a small offering to help you cultivate big change by creating more connection and purpose in your daily life, with you as a valued resident of your ecosystem, at its centre. And then – you can work from that grounded place to rise up and be part of the change we all need: with your hands full of goodness, and your heart unbroken.” Signed copies of The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook are available worldwide now!

Welcome to the first year of our garden, in which we transformed our backyard from a grassy slope into a terraced land of veggies, fruit trees, berries and chickens, with so many flowers in between that the bees are spoilt for choice. We live on un-ceded melukerdee country in southern lutruwita Tasmania, on a / acre block with an ’s brick veneer house with a lovely aspect and a leaky roof. We’ve been here since mid , and started on the garden in mid . The block is on the edge of a village, and slopes gently to the north, with most of the yard on the northern side. We came here with many plans to grow All The Things (within reason) and create an amazing backyard permaculture system that could feed and nourish our family, while being inter-connected with our wider community and ecosystem – through reciprocity of seeds, knowledge, harvest, helping hands and whatever else made sense to give and receive. It’s all going pretty well so far, after a Very Big first few years of constructing, planting, making and doing. We’re well overdue for a ‘how we made the garden’ article, but life has been busy. There’s been some marvellous upsides to the last few years, with creating online courses, amazing crew, beautiful students, an emerging new book, a growing teen and other good things. There’s also been some curly health situations happening at our place – some of which we’ve made it through, and some of which are emerging and ongoing. All this has meant that it’s been a very full few years, and we are happy to have made it this far. And that’s our context for this garden, I guess. The berries in our arbour teach us that there’s leafless ebbs in between the seasons of new growth, and plenty of prickles. But also that there’s plenty of sweetness, in it’s season, dripping ripe berries, just waiting to be picked and eaten and shared around. In the first  months of the garden, we: A note that I’m going to talk bare-faced numbers, labour inputs and costs here, because we’re always being asked for those by students and our wider network. It does feel a bit exposing to do so, but here we go. We would not have been able to do this backyard design build and install without a generous family loan of $k, which we’re still paying back – thank you, family! The other thing is – people, not individuals, create gardens (in co-creation with all the other life species, minerals and everything else) – we had help at all the stages of creating this garden. Just like the lone hero narrative is never accurate (there’s always plenty of help and privilege that comes into it), so is the ‘I created this garden myself’ narrative. Nearly always. And after decades of creating, and helping others create and maintain wonderful gardens, I’d like to make sure this is clear. People, not individuals, create gardens – and it’s important to acknowledge that, so that noone reading this mistakenly things that they, too, could do all of this themselves, if they only just tried hard enough. I mean, maybe you could, if it was all you did for  years (and someone else made the rest of your life happen for you?), you had an uncanny combination of All The Skills needed, your back muscles were very, very intact, and someone else was somehow paying for it all. But nearly always, there’s many other people and resources involved. Even if, like us, you identify as a gardener and lover of all things DIY. My point is – we didn’t do all this alone. We’ve put in the majority of the hours, it’s true, but not all of them. People make gardens. And we’ll be thanking them as we go through this run-down. So, it’s probably best that you begin by checking out our article that describes and details the garden design, which is full of all the WHY bit of this backyard system, which we designed with our friend Hannah. We basically chose this house because of the backyard’s aspect and slope (admittedly, in early  during the first round of covid lockdowns, there were only  houses in our valley for sale to choose from, but still! This seemed like a good choice at the time, and we’re still glad – leaky roof and all). So – the garden design needed to incorporate lots of food growing, some grass for playing, a fair bit of eating and living outside vibes, chickens, maybe goats, and whatever else we could fit in. Rather than debating the design for  years between us, we employed our friend Hannah Moloney to turn our dreams into functional reality. Because sometimes it’s better to stay married, outsource the design challenge, and get another expert to do the work for you. Thanks, Hannah! The backyard had an equator-facing slope that was not gentle, but not not too steep, either – which meant that we knew we could create wide terraces on it (to make more usable, flat spaces) without too much cost. If we’d had zero cash at this point, we would have used other techniques to create these terraces and areas. Our previous family farm and rental backyard design projects have largely always been a ‘bit by bit’ approach, cobbling things together with found materials and using slow, small solutions. In this case though, we really wanted to get the mainframe of the design in place ASAP – earthworks, terraces, walls – with the help of some big ol’ machinery and rocks. From there, we could develop garden beds and plantings, bit by bit, as time and energy allowed. So this approach involved up-front costs, and a chunk of fossil fuel use, in terms of earthmoving equipment for a week, and trucks to bring rocks and all the rest of the bits. We considered this week of Big Inputs And Costs against the fact that once this work was done, we could get planting and growing food for multiple future decades. And whoever stewards this patch after us will have a sweet setup for growing food also (and much better soil by that point). Is it ever truly possible to audit how a week’s worth of intensive diesel use balances out, in terms of future food grown, food miles reduced, carbon sequestered by fruit trees, composting, carbon sinks, home-based living and happiness gained? I don’t have easy answers to this. I could argue the adverse impacts away in all kinds of ways, i guess – including our work as permaculture and veggie gardening teachers helping to create more gardens all over the planet via this garden, etc and so on. And that would all be true. But at the same time, let’s just call this undertaking what it was. A week that took our backyard from a grassy slope to a terraced, rock-walled, super-useful growing space, for generations to come – powered by currently-available diesel machinery. It was quick, input-heavy, loud, dusty, muddy and… frankly, miraculous. Having done a fair whack of garden building (and house building, and farm building…) over the years now of both types – from incremental and achingly slow hand-crafted builds to this ‘chuck some cash and machines and rocks at it’ mainframe… I can confidently say that each approach has their place, and their advantages, and their costs. Energy in (human, ancient forests transformed into diesel, other resources, sanity) for energy out. It’s a balance that any project has to strike. You make decisions. And then you have to live with the results of the pragmatism, or the idealism, or the urgency that powered those decisions. No pressure! Heh. For us, this time around, we decided to use the resources we had at the time (a small family loan, good earthmoving contacts) and turn those into the bones of a backyard system that we would then work on for the next  years with our hands and our hearts, bit by bit. It was all supposed to begin in autumn before the winter rains, but as is bound to happen with such things, delays happened and we didn’t start till winter, and the ground was not dry. But Tim the earthmover was booked (such a legend), the rocks were ordered, and some gravel was on the way…. so we were all full steam ahead. Tim used a  tonne excavator and a skid steer loader (bobcat) to terra-form the heavy clays of our backyard into a series of terraces, the top one of which was supported by a rock wall. The lower terrace would be supported by an earth berm, and below that, two long hugelculture (kinda) orchard beds were built on contour. Below that, where the chicken yard was going, Tim dug out some topsoil to build the forest garden beds with – and dug a small pond, because ponds are great.  By the end of the week we had created: a top level terrace for outdoor kitchen / firepit / hangout space, which was made of subsoil from the site and some local road base material, held up by a boulder wall, topped with gravel for drainage, and finished with crushed limestone. Tim delicately added a thin ring of topsoil all the way around the edge of this terrace, for the future herb garden. A lower terrace created space for gardens across the front of the house, with a low rock wall to connect with the large second terrace. Tim made stairs from flat boulders he had identified for the purpose, to get us from the top terrace down to the next terrace. There’s a no-steps path around the edge along the fence-line too, for wheelbarrows and folks who can’t do steps. Next terrace down – the main veggie growing space – space for veggie beds and a future greenhouse, and a small patch of flat lawn on the other side, for kids and dogs to rumble on. The lawn side got a low rock wall to hold it up, and the veggie side got a sloped earth berm, so we could plant into it. Next terrace down – a flat shelf for the berry arbour! And the first of the long, on contour forest garden beds. And below that, another on-contour forest garden bed, and a path to the chicken run. We constructed these forest garden beds with a bit of hugelculture vibes (it was a hasty process as earthworks-hours were running out, so it’s a ‘kinda-hugelculture’)… which involves building earth garden beds over wooden logs and sticks, to allow for good drainage and a slow process of breaking down, over time, of wood into soil. I say ‘kinda’ because we just used the broken up, uprooted shrubs and pittosporum that were dotted around the backyard (which we didn’t wish to keep) and combined those with topsoil to form these beds. It wasn’t a bad idea, but if we’d had more time we would have done a more thorough job of it. And below all that, the chicken run. Tim cut a shelf so there would be flat space in the run, and used the material from that cut as topsoil for the forest garden beds. And dug a small pond next to it. The pond is well positioned, and absorbs any runoff from the forest garden beds during a downpour, which keeps the pond full / of the year. And before Tim left, he used his bobcat to help us spread aged sawdust (got from a local sawmill) widely over the veggie garden terrace, to turn it from a mud pit into space that we could start working on. We also got some woodchip paths in place quick-smart, so we could move around the space effectively, and be clear what was path and what was garden (which isn’t always clear, when it all just looks like mud). Whew! And in a week, all the earthworks were done. Thank you weather gods, for not raining on our heads all week. Thank you Tim Agouzoul of Artisan Earthworks, you are an artist and a gentleman besides. A treat to work with. Notes on the terraforming: All up, the earthworks, dolerite boulders, gravel, road base, sawdust and woodchip cost about $k of investment. We benefited from a very generous earthmover as well as access to cheap sawdust and wood chips from our local timber mill and low-cost rock products from nearby quarries. Tim made it clear from the start that he was not a landscaper. We employed him for his exceptional rock wall building and terraforming, all work he did with his machines. We did not employ him to be onsite for weeks moving soil around by hand to create manicured gardens and finish the entire project. So there was A LOT of extra work that we needed to do and still are doing to make the garden beautiful. That was part of the deal from the start.  I think if you were trying to get a similar project done now, in almost any other place in Australia without the access we have to cheap local materials, our guess is that it would cost a lot closer to $K. Around the edges of the top terrace, Tim carefully added some topsoil, so we could plant a herb garden all the way around. This topsoil was also full of twitch roots – a really pernicious grass that’s hard to get rid of – so we spent some extra time creating a cardboard mulch layer before planting into that (a note – we were not super aware of PFAS being in most cardboard boxes, at the time. If we did this bit again, we would do this layer with biodegradable jute horticultural felt, which we used effectively elsewhere in the garden). This garden received most of the rescued hardy herbs and flowers I’d saved from the former garden that was hiding under the long grass when we moved in. I’d carefully dug each herb out before we did the earthworks and potted them all, and now they went back in the ground. We added a lemon tree at one end, and a fig tree in a microclimate nook, surrounded by rock wall – its marginal in our climate for the fig, but I’m hopeful. Along the house wall, which is north facing, we planted all our citrus. This wall is our warmest microclimate, so it seemed the best place for citrus – we’ve planted blood oranges, limes, mandarines and more mandarines. In front of that is more herbs, lots of medicinal plants, and a path-edging of strawberries. In the bed on the other side of that path, along the low rock wall, it’s more strawberries, more medicinal herbs, blueberries, and rhubarb. That bed ends with a persimmon planted on each side of the stone steps, which we can’t wait to help thrive (I love persimmons). The veggie bed terrace will one day contain a handmade greenhouse made from recycled stuff that utilizes the rock wall for thermal mass, next to the outside veggie beds. In this greenhouse I will raise many beautiful seedlings and grow season-extended tomatoes, eggplants, chillies and all the good green things that hurumph at the coldish climate where we live. I will! And until that happens, it’s all about the  outdoor veggie beds, and filling these with seasonal food that can handle our cool temperate outdoor climate. There’s still plenty to grow. We aligned these veggie beds north-south, to give maximum solar gain to each whole veggie bed. In summer, it’s light for + hours a day here, but in winter, the days are short. So every small ray of sunlight is appreciated, when you’re a winter broccoli. We chose to source fresh cut (green) hardwood boards (Eucalyptus obliqua known as messmate stringybark / Tassie oak) from a small local mill (they were happy to cut to size) for our veggie beds. They are a small family crew who cut this timber from their own property. We’re hoping for  or more years from the boards in our beds before they rot away and need to be replaced – I shall report back when that happens.  Since then, we have found Bodie and his awesome little local business Dovetail Timbers. They make their garden beds out of salvaged hardwood or for a bit extra they offer Cypress salvaged from old farm windbreaks – it lasts longer in contact with the ground and soil than most other available woods. They ship Australia wide, by the way! Why this bed design / construction: After many years of gardening (and market gardening) and working with a variety of bed styles and types, we went with a simple design of edged beds for our home garden. Not high enough to be raised beds, but edges defined so that it’s easy to keep bed soil in, and path woodchips/sawdust out. The beds each measure .m wide by m long. And the paths are cm wide. The bed size and length (and the path widths, also) were defined after much trial-and-error in other gardens, and are our personal preference. We’ve found that beds that are too long can be laborious to work with in a home context, and beds that are too short use more materials for less bed space. So these beds are double-reach width (for ease of planting, weeding and harvesting) and long enough to plant a decent crop of one type for a small family, in one bed. The boards are mm thick by mm wide (″x″) and Nick constructed the beds with vertical stakes ( x  x mm) along the inside edges and corners and heavy duty bugle batten screws to hold them all together. They basically just sit on the ground.  The path widths were defined by being wide enough to get a wheelbarrow down them if needed without squishing the beds, but not so wide that they ate up all the garden space. We filled the paths deeply with aged sawdust, which was available in quantity and a great working surface – absorbent of rain, and nicely spongey to work on. Along the north edge of this section is a thin row of perennial beds, which forms the edge of the terrace – mostly planted with asparagus, and a few beds with dahlias, bergamot and (currently) celery. For the soil of these beds, we used a combo of the topsoil that the terrace was constructed of (the soil already beneath the beds) which was heavy clay soil,- and mixed this with some commercial compost from Cherries Tasmania (which came recommended from local market gardeners, and which we found great!). Breaking up the great clods of on-site clay soil and working it to the point where it could be mixed with anything, took quite a while. But slowly, each bed emerged. We prepped the soil for each bed first, then built the bed edges around it- this made it easier to work the soil this first time. I’ll do a seperate article on this bed making process, but in answer to ‘why didn’t you do no dig?’ … ‘why did you dig up the soil?’ and similar questions… it was a combo of cost (much cheaper to use our exisiting soil than import masses of topsoil), ethics (wanting to limit inputs where we could) and wanting to know what was in our veggie bed’s soil, which isn’t always possible when you import stuff from elsewhere. Now that these beds are constructed in this way, we can turn the soil as little as possible. We basically just aerate with a fork and add home-made compost to the top seedbed, for each new planting cycle. It’s working well so far. During this veggie bed construction phase, we met and started working with Jimmy! Jim Zerella had recently moved to the area at the time, a market gardener and ex-chef. We were very happy to have him helping in the garden on most Fridays. Having someone else who is going to show up once a week and work their ass off in the garden all day is also a really great motivator to do the same, no matter how busy you are. Jimmy is now growing full-time at Gardeners Bay Farm and we are thankful to have worked with him for a few years. Yay for Jimmy Zee. A tunnel of berries! So many that there’s plenty for the birds AND for us! Berries night and day for months! All the berries! – this was my fever dream. I quite like berries. So when Hannah suggested ‘you could make a berry arbour’ to my ‘I want ALL the berries’ enthusiasm, that was that. A tunnel of summer deliciousness was the plan. The berry arbour also warrants a seperate article, because Nick did such a great job of constructing it in a way that should last decades. And getting your arches the same shape, in a repeating row, turns out to be not super simple. So here is the short version, until a later point. The berry arbour is  arches of ‘trench mesh’, secured with star pickets and fencing wire, with added horizontal lengths of the same mesh between them for added strength and also growing structures. Trench mesh is basically a -bar steel mesh, used for (wait for it) reinforcing concrete trenches. It’s lightweight, non-toxic, strong, available everywhere and not hideously expensive. All in all, great for this purpose. Trench mesh is however a material with high embodied energy, that traveled a long way to get here. We have used a lot of upcycled scrap reinforcing mesh we have salvaged from the local tip for many projects around the garden, but this stuff we purchased new.  We chose a thin mesh, as opposed to wider arches, because we thought, with our climate, we’d want lots of light penetration between arches, and lots of airflow. While a solid tunnel of berries sounded like heaven, pruning a long, continuous tunnel of super spiky brambles each winter, and having to untangle millions of long, triffid-like runners with spiky spikes in order to prune out all the old ones, did not sound like heaven. So having gaps made this yearly job much easier, also. The horizontal spans of trench mesh along each side (at cm and m high) were for the raspberries to grow up through. Mmmm raspberries. We planted the berry arbour with a different climbing berry on each arch – tayberries, loganberries, sylvanberries, repeat. Summer-fruiting raspberries dotted in along the north side, and autumn-fruiting raspberries dotted along the south side. At the end arches of the arbour, I planted clematis and jasmine (because flowers), to bookend all those berries. Below the berry arbour is the orchard. This is a mix of fruit trees on dwarf rootstock (to keep them manageable in this relatively small space, and fruit net-able if needed) and a growing understorey of herbs, flowers, currants and medicinals. We managed to squish in two apricots, a pear, a nashi and a cherry in the top bed, and two plums plus two nectarines in the lower bed. The bed down the bottom contains an Anzac Peach (not on dwarf rootstock) that gets it’s own bed, surrounded by currants, jostaberries and gooseberries. Because peaches are the best. And our one and only apple tree (so far) gets it’s own bed too – it’s a Mutsu (on M semi-dwarf rootsta ock), about to be grafted with  more apple varieties (thanks to our friend’s heritage apples) so we can have a bit of a varied harvest. We live in a valley of apple trees and in apple season they are everywhere – gifted and swapped, with everyone’s car boot full of the things – so one apple tree seemed enough, to begin with. Underneath the new trees there’s a growing under-storey of of calendula and cosmos, comfrey, lemon balm, sages and mints, lupins and red avens, dahlias and yarrow, yarrow yarrow. All super low maintenance and hardy perennial plants, with either edible, medicinal or pollinator-supporting qualities. Note – we eat chicken on occasion, and we’d rather take responsibility for their ‘great life and one bad day’ than eating sad, awfully-farmed chicken from the shop. If this conversation is not for you, skip this section! The chicken run are was designed to have chickens AND milking goats residing in it… but at the moment, it’s very much a chicken-focussed situation. It’s always good to plan infrastructure for everything you might want to incorporate in the future – and the last place we lived for any length of time before here, which was at Melliodora, I was milking goats nearly every day – which I loved. But we decided to start with just chickens. Between them, two dogs and a teenager, that’s a complex enough morning routine for now, without adding in milking and cheesemaking before breakfast on the daily – plus wrangling goat-walks (and inevitable goat-escapes) each day. Maybe we’ll get goats one day! For now, it’s all about the chickens. We made the chicken run from dogwood poles that Nick sourced from a local farmer who was thinning them on his block, and chicken wire. The chicken house is a re-build of the chicken house that was in our backyard when we got here, but with some re-sizing, and other renovations. It has a north-facing window for morning light, three nesting boxes, four chicken perches, and a slatted floor to let the chicken poo fall through. We then collect and use the chicken poo for fertilizer. We’re planning on running a yearly flock of  chickens and a rooster over winter, and then hatch  rounds of babies using whichever first two hens go broody in the spring. Those baby chicks then grow up through spring and summer, watched over by their clucky gorgeous hen mothers… up to pullet size, until they start to crow, or not. At this point, we assess all the new teenagers as possible new hens, or roosters. The roosters then get harvested and put in the freezer (we’re working up to them being our main chicken soup supply each year – which means only occasional chicken) and we decide which hens to keep for our next winter flock of  – usually half older ones, half younger ones. Extra hens then get given to friends (we could eat them as well, but lots of our friends need laying hens, so better to share the love, we rekon) and we’re back to  hens and  rooster by mid Autumn. We’re slowly building up a flock of Quamby chickens, which are a breed bred for lutruwita / Tassie conditions and are a great ‘dual purpose breed’ – a combo of dependable layers and good eating. We currently have a quamby rooster and  quamby hens, alongside  black ‘hedge chickens’ – who literally came out of a hedge, for free, from an ad we saw on Gumtree. Over this coming summer, we hope to bring that number of quamby hens up to , or thereabouts. The chickens stay in this fixed yard system all the time, because we have small dogs who are on possum-patrol. But the yard is a huge deep litter system, and they get green-pick every day from my weedings and gatherings, plus all the kitchen scraps. You could keep  chickens in this space and it would still be ‘free range’, but we think  (with a seasonal swell to maybe twice that, and then back down again in winter) is better. Plenty of space to roam, scratch, dust-bath and explore makes for super healthy and happy chickens. We’ve got a Grandpa Feeder in front of their chicken house, which is a great rodent-proof feeder and does the trick nicely – it gets refilled with laying pellets once every few weeks. A note on this feeder – it’s not the cheapest, but the last ones we had (at Milkwood Farm, many moons ago) are still going strong at our friend’s farm, + years later – so they’re a good example of ‘buy it once, buy it right’. The chickens rainwater comes from the roof of the chicken house, and into a holding tank to which Nick attached an array of poultry nipple drinkers (yes, that is a thing) – the chickens peck away at the shiny nipples to have a drink, the water stays fresh and never gets muddy, and the chickens don’t run out of water – so everyone’s healthy and happy. The centre of the chicken yard is also developing as an ‘extra deep litter system’ which the chickens scratch in to uncover plenty of worms and bugs to eat. Around the edges of the run are drier patches under acacias and a paperbark, where the chickens hang out and make their dust baths. I’ll do a seperate article on all the chicken bits – house design and so on, because a lot of you have been asking! Stand by. Right down the bottom of the garden is our wettest, shadiest place – great big blackwood acacias throw year-round shade from over the bottom fence, and we’re planting more blackwoods (which are fire retardant, and generally wonderful) on our side, with an under-storey of pepperberries, this season. In this shady, moist place is where our mushroom logs live, all tucked in and stacked closely – the humidity and shade mean it’s the best spot for them, while they quietly myceliate with the shiitake, phoenix oyster, lions mane and pioppino mushroom spawn we’ve inoculated them with, until they are ready to fruit. And as a bonus, when these logs ARE nearly ready to fruit, we can pop them in the small pond right there for  hours to soak -the soaking helps trigger fruiting, and ensures the mycelium has all the moisture they need, to move to the optimistic fruiting phase. Then after a day of soaking, we can drain the logs, re-stack them along an open frame back in the shade, and watch carefully for the delicious mushrooms to emerge. Down the side of our backyard is a yet-to-be-designed strip that is currently grass. Originally, we were going to fence it off from the main growing space as a grassy dog / kid / goat area, with the possibility of future sheds, a sauna, writing studio and more. For now, the main part of the design is keeping us busy (and next on the list is a greenhouse! And a non-leaky house roof) – so the side bit will have to wait. At the moment it brings joy to small dogs and their ball-chasing, and occasional outbreaks of kids rolling down the slope or improvising variations on cricket during outdoor cookups. And that’s fine by me. I’m going to semi-cheat at call this ‘one year later’, though it was  months from the start of the earthworks, which was from mid-winter  through to December (mid-summer) . But I think it’s fair to call it a year, as we were still planting the garden that first summer, and finishing off the veggie beds at that point. So – one year later from most beds being planted, summer  to summer …. we were well on our way to a cranking garden. It was wonderful to shoot pictures for our next book in our garden last summer, only a year after it had all been planted! I didn’t expect that. But plants are amazing and we are lucky to be co-creating this space with them. And now, the sap is rising and the days are lengthening, as we emerge out of a mild winter. I’m looking forward this summer to getting to know all the plants in our garden a bit better, start harvesting some medicinals, and harvesting an apricot or two. Any questions on anything above, please fire away! Happy to clarify. And as mentioned, I’ll write up the full deal (with diagrams etc) on the veggie beds, the berry arbour and the chicken run in the coming months.

"At its heart, The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook is about helping you cultivate habits for living with meaningful connection and purpose. Because this is how we cultivate hope. But how to get started with habits that are truly world-changing? And how do you ground yourself and create resolve to keep going in the face of so much grief, challenge and change? Happily, there’s a design and thinking system called permaculture that can help us chart a course forward to the futures we need. Permaculture is, in many ways, simply a goal: of living in functional, meaningful relation to our ecosystems, with reciprocity at the core of that relationship; a goal of living in a connected, meaningful way that benefits land, waters, life and community, as well as meeting our own needs for a fulfilling life. By ecosystem, I mean where you are right now, not just your nearest forest, river or wild place. Your ecosystem doesn’t stop at the forest’s edge. Your ecosystem is all around you: right up to your front step, into your kitchen, even inside you. All this is part of your local ecosystem. And it is all part of your duty of care, as a resident of that ecosystem and as a part of nature. Because you are very much a part of nature. Nature is not ‘over there’ somewhere. Sure, that bit of nature over there might be greener and prettier than where you’re sitting, but you are interacting with and making an impact on multiple living things, both micro and macro, in this exact moment. And how you show up in your ecosystem matters. Better yet, the animals known as humans – that’s you and me – can play an important role in creating abundance within our ecosystem. You are a part of nature just as much as the fruit trees, the forests and the fish swimming upriver. You could be forgiven for thinking that our species is only destructive – there’s overwhelming evidence of the harm we can do all around us… but it’s also true that you can participate in your ecosystem in a way that tends seeds and people, nourishes plants, pollinators and relationships, and builds soil and community. So, how can you tend some of these ecosystemic relationships of yours, both known and unknown, by the choices you make and the actions you take on the daily? Is it possible to live in a way that considers your responsibilities to your ecosystem and your community, while building connection and meaning in your own life, all while going about the normal daily stuff in this busy world of ours? Well, yes. There are many ways and many knowledge systems that have been doing exactly this for as long as there have been people. There are also newer frameworks; though, of course, the new ways are always drawing on and standing on the shoulders of the old ways. Some of these knowledge-ways are vast, embodied in country, culture and people. Some of the newer, far more simple frameworks have been written down, so that anyone can try them out. Permaculture is just one of the recent frameworks, but we love it because it’s simple, flexible and easily incorporated into everyday life, so you can start using it right now. At Milkwood, we see permaculture as a way of consciously designing, bit by bit, how we meet our responsibilities to our ecosystems and to ourselves. How we eat, the choices we make, how we use energy and how we use our privilege. How we help out, how we advocate, how we garden, how we love. And how we aim to live as meaningfully as we can, both in our personal actions and by getting involved in urgent system change to create communities, societies and governments that prioritise care over profit – for the benefit of people, ecosystem and planet. Like any community-held knowledge base, permaculture is always evolving, especially as it’s a design system, a teaching system and a set of thinking tools for daily use. At Milkwood, we have adapted it in our own ways, as others do in their own, and this book (this is an extract, just btw) builds on our approach. Rewind a bit: the s was a time when climate change was a relatively new topic of conversation, the downsides of industrial agriculture went largely unquestioned, and Silent Spring, Rachel Carson’s classic book explaining the toxic legacy of pesticides in our ecosystems, had not long been written. The damage that we were doing to our world and its peoples in the name of progress, through capitalism and colonisation, and the realisation that the promise of endless plains and untamed wilderness ripe for the taking was a destructive, catastrophic myth were only beginning to dawn on many, especially in western countries. In this context, the term permaculture (permanent agriculture, permanent culture) was coined by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in lutruwita/Tasmania. At the time, Mollison and Holmgren were both thinking deeply about what a grassroots, principles- based, holistic system for designing agriculture and human habitats could look like; a system that was based on regeneration rather than extraction. Believe it or not, this was quite an unusual concept at a time when much of the developed world was doubling down on the promise of endless growth. This design system needed to be grassroots enough to be used by just about anyone, with design principles that could hold true across different ecosystems and landscapes, and be used to design both human habitats and actually regenerative agricultural systems (as opposed to ones that were simply less destructive). And so, drawing on many diverse influences and their own learning, Mollison and Holmgren defined the design system that they called permaculture. Permaculture was – and is – a weaving together of ideas inspired and informed by Indigenous knowledge and science and many thinkers, both past and present, working in the realms of landscape design, ecology, ethics, perennial agriculture and architecture. And . . . guess what? Drawing this knowledge into a grassroots design system that could be used to regenerate landscapes meant that it was one that could regenerate community, too. These principles that focused on designing in partnership with ecosystems, rather than separate from them, could also be used to support the re-emergence of regenerative communities, from the individual to the city level. This should come as no surprise, if you look at Indigenous wisdom and practices, which remind us that Country and people are indivisible: we are not separate from nature. What’s good for Country is good for people. But it bears repeating here: like most of modern thought and design, permaculture theory – including its ethics, principles and skills – is all, directly or indirectly, based on the wisdom, knowledge and science of traditional and Indigenous peoples the world over. Some permaculturists actively acknowledge these legacies, while others are criticised for not adequately recognising such histories. For us, this recognition is central to permaculture, and to our combined ability to use what skills and knowledge is available to us all, build better and more just worlds and futures. Concepts like our reliance on the regeneration of and reciprocity within our ecosystems are not ‘new’ information – quite the opposite. And yet, in our current society, we seem to have forgotten this. These are fundamental truths that we each need back at the centre of our lives, no matter where or how we live now. It is vital that these truths once more become a core part of our decision-making for ourselves, our families, our communities and our ecosystems. I’m not only talking about other people’s ancestors or unbroken lines of traditional knowledge here; your own family histories, interrupted as they may be by participating in colonisation, white supremacy and other systems of violence, can also form a part of this traditional lineage. While we’re well versed in the collective damage previous (and current) generations have done to ecosystems and communities across the world… you are also the direct descendant of people who once held land-based knowledge well; who cultivated community, knew their local waterways like family, and saved and passed seeds from hand to hand through generations. So some of this is your people’s knowledge, too. The point of permaculture design and thinking, as we see it, is to respectfully draw on these fundamentally excellent concepts and principles to inform our everyday lives. And you can do this in a way that works for you, your household and your ecosystem, to make your life better, while actively practising gratitude for and solidarity with the traditional and Indigenous knowledge-keepers, both past and present, to whom we owe pretty much everything. Since the s, the permaculture movement has decentralised into a worldwide, mycelium-like network of designers, thinkers, makers and doers. Permaculture principles are used all over the world, by all sorts of folks – to design ecovillages in Argentina, accountancy practices in London, schools and entire suburbs, community centres and university courses, to create alternative currencies and community resilience plans, and many a garden, home, homestead and farm, too. Permaculture has even been used, on occasion, as a principle-based toolbox to help reboot traditional agricultural systems, which, once up and running again, no longer use the word ‘permaculture’, because the old ways have re-emerged and been reclaimed. It’s an incredibly useful framework for thinking about how we relate to place, and how we can live like it matters. Because it does. For many of us wanting to do better by our planet, we need all the help we can get when it comes to principles and frameworks for living well and in relationship to our ecosystems. Permaculture is just one set of ideas – scaffolding you can use – to build an amazing and resilient life, home and community, to build reciprocity with your ecosystem, and to enable a future of possibilities, even in a world out of balance. So, what could this all look like at your place? To help make these ideas more clear, permaculture can be broken down into three ethics and twelve principles that you can use as thinking tools, goals and guides to build a meaningful life. “It’s about living with integrity at all the levels – from the macro to the micro” – Tyson Yungaporta, For the Wild podcast At the foundation of permaculture are three ethics: Earth Care, People Care and Fair Share. These core ethics, or some form of them, can be found in all traditional cultures. Bill Mollison and I, back in the s, saw that this ethical foundation was an essential basis for sustainable design – or what we called permaculture ~ David Holmgren, Permaculture Living course We see these ethics as top-level thinking tools, and a good ‘first things first’ guide for how to live. You can use these ethics as a framework to guide your decision-making and actions while planning for a life worth living. Here’s what they mean to us at Milkwood. This is care of the big Earth, our combined home, and care of the small earth, the soil beneath our feet. Earth care can be many things, including but not limited to organising, voting and taking action on things like climate justice; tending the earth that sustains each and every one of us with just and equitable food systems; and understanding that we are part of our ecosystems, not separate from them, and that we each need to step up to the responsibilities that go along with that. People care is living our lives in a way that is kind, safe and healthy – for ourselves, our households and our communities – while doing the least harm possible to others. People care is supporting mutual aid, considering what we consume and its impacts on people far away, and how we vote. It’s how we show up in our communities – both in times of plenty and in times of crisis – to ensure the best outcome for everyone, not just ourselves. People Care is how we work on decolonising our thinking and our actions, along with dismantling our inherited and internal racism; how we seek to be lifelong learners, to co-create a more just world; how we attempt to do the work, and not carry destructive patterns forward – for ourselves, our families and our communities. Fair Share is passing on the surplus and, importantly, ensuring our portion is no larger than it needs to be. It’s reassessing what ‘need’ is to us, and making do with less if we can, to ensure there’s more for others – people, plants and all the other life, too. Planting more than we need, so that there’s enough to share. Voting, advocating and taking action in a way that creates equity for those in our community who do not have our privileges. Fair Share is sharing seeds, skills and knowledge, so that more folks in more communities can thrive, and so that ecosystems and biodiversity can thrive, too. Combined with the ethics, Holmgren defined  permaculture principles – (Mollison defined a different set which are also super useful, but let’s just go through these ones for today). You can use these to help you think about, plan, design, create things and act with a view to the greater whole. These principles are flexible thinking tools that you can adapt to designs, situations and challenges both big and small. The strategies and techniques in permaculture are constantly varying . . . and what might be appropriate in one context is not in another. But the design principles are general guides that we can use to help shape what we’re doing, or reflect on whether a particular solution is a good one, or not. David Holmgren, Permaculture Living course They’re not ‘rules’ by any means; they are simply tools to inform your thinking and decision making. These principles can be used to design big projects, but they can also be used to help you make better daily choices, and to form new habits. This principle reminds us to use all our senses and our powers of observation to truly assess things before taking action, rather than charging in based upon something we’ve read or been told. This principle helps us remember that energy is flowing through our systems all the time – in sunlight, wind, water, money, the harvest, good will, and a million other forms – but that this energy often only comes in pulses; therefore, it’s important that we learn to store it so that we can use it when we need it. Along with storing energy, this principle helps drive systems forward. It’s essential to obtain a yield in some form to carry on, whether that’s veggies, stored power, stored heat or stronger community relationships. Otherwise, it’s just not possible to survive long term. This principle balances the two before it, and is just as important. It’s a constraining principle, to ensure ongoing evaluation, and that you take the time to adjust to whatever you discover as a result. A familiar concept to us all by now, this principle is about designing for and choosing services and resources that are renewable, rather than ones that are will deplete and disappear. You’ll be familiar with this one, as it thankfully creeps back into our society. It’s the concept of using every part of something, and making choices to only work with, buy or choose things that you can use entirely. This reminds us to look at the whole, rather than just the parts, when we begin to design something – which we often need to be reminded of in this reductionist world! The whole is more than the sum of the parts. This principle encourages us to integrate elements and functions rather than keep them neatly apart, because separation usually ends up requiring more resources. It’s about using one element’s output as another’s input: to reuse everything we can, reduce pollution, conserve energy and make the most of the resources that we have. Think about the ways we can mimic the simple process of planting a small seed and watching it grow slowly into a big, beautiful tree. This principle is about elegance and efficiency of design: considering the simplest solution possible to achieve our goals – rather than doing something big and fast that inadvertently has negative impacts – while staying within our limits. This is about valuing the biodiversity of life to create stable systems, using and valuing diverse solutions to a problem, and striving to live outside the binary (in all the ways!). This reminds us to look to the periphery, because that’s often where, frankly, the most interesting stuff is happening! These peripherals may seem small, but they’re often significant and can hold great value for all of us. This final principle is particularly powerful. It’s about acknowledging biological and other processes, and responding to them in a constructive way, rather than using extra energy to block or work against them. It’s going with the flow, and using that flow to your advantage, on both the micro and macro design level. “Planting a tree or a seed, these acts are expressions of sacred reciprocity, because these seeds and young trees often need tending to by humans to survive. These are acts that say, humans belong. Humans have a role in keeping life abundant, in the same way that a salmon swimming upstream does by delivering nutrients from the sea far into the interior forests. ” – Sonya and Nina Montenegro, The Far Woods  If you would like future articles like this sent straight to your inbox, you can subscribe here. It’s free (yay). This article is an extract from our new book, The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook. This is a handbook of good ideas and habits for your every day. Each one of these habits is small, and not revolutionary in and of themselves. And they also are, each of them, fundamentally world-shifting. Each one separates us a little bit more from the systems and structures that have been so toxic to life on earth – each habit opens up space for us to create new futures. Because the change that we need, the worlds that we need, begin now. Each day. They’re not an arrival point in the future. We are co-creating the future every day of our lives, and we can do that in a way that creates more equity, more justice, more deliciousness, and which leans towards life. While just doing our daily stuff. But with meaning, and purpose. This is a handbook for living like it matters.     ";Milkwood
Winter is a great time of year to welcome new strains of tasty mushrooms into your backyard. You can even gather some edible species from around your local ‘hood, and then multiply them at home with this easy mushroom cloning technique – to make DIY mushroom spawn on cardboard. All you need is some cardboard, and a little time. And in a few weeks, once your DIY mushroom spawn is growing, happy and healthy, you can then tuck them in all around your garden, (along with woodchips, which have been prepped with a simple technique we will show you) to create an edible mushroom garden. We love mushroom gardens – they’re a beautiful way to bring the forest home, building diversity in your backyard, AND increase your household’s resilience with yet another tasty mushroom harvest. The best bit? They (the mycelium) will take care of themselves, grow at a pace that suits your garden and the seasons, and then pop up in flushes of tasty mushrooms, when the mycelium is good and ready. This technique is super simple. You gather suitable edible mushrooms, like Wood Blewits, that are popping up under certain trees and at the edge of wooded areas – and then you can get making your own DIY cardboard spawn! This spawn can then be used to inoculate mushroom gardens wherever you like – in garden patches, underneath shrubs and trees, along your woodchip paths, or whatever you’ve decided would be a great spot for a patch of edible mushrooms. See our  Top Mushrooms to Grow at Home guide for a bit more info on different types of mushrooms that LOVE growing in gardens – including King Stropharia, which we talk about extensively in our Home Mushroom Garden how-tos. You can use this technique with many kinds of mushrooms that like to grow in this way. Not all mushrooms like to eat the same foods, so it’s good to know what will work and what won’t – but there’s plenty of easy to grow, super tasty mushrooms that live very happily in woodchip and compost-rich environments in your backyard. For the purposes of this example, we’re using the Wood Blewit (Clitocybe nuda), also known as Lepista nuda (full description here). They’re a mushroom that primarily grows in deciduous and coniferous woodlands, but can also be found in grassy areas such as fields and pastures. Wood Blewits are a saprotrophic species, meaning they feed on dead organic material. They particularly likes growing on organic matter that has already partially decomposed, so they’re typically found growing in rich soil or in leaf litter. They appear during autumn and winter months in temperate regions all over the world. Wood Blewits like cool, moist environments, grow in small clusters, and they can sometimes be found near compost piles due to their preference for organic material. Keep in mind that while this fungus is edible and enjoyed by many, it should be cooked well and it can be confused with other, inedible or toxic species, so it’s important to make sure you have a positive identifications before eating them.  Blewits, like all fungi, are a valuable part of the ecosystem. One of their particular jobs in this web of life is taking woody material and further decomposing it, by eating it, to take that material further towards being rich topsoil that more and more life can thrive in. They are easy to grow, very tasty when well-cooked, and a great garden friend to have in your backyard. Here’s a snippet of Nick talking about making cardboard spawn in a free online workshop we did, then below that is the full step by step guide. So as said, this easy mushroom cloning technique is perfect for the ‘secondary decomposers’ – the mushrooms that like a rich complex substrate of woody materials – such as King Stropharia or Wood Blewits. You can make this DIY mushroom cardboard spawn from everyday items that you probably already have in your home, once you’ve got your mushrooms! So now you’ve got your healthy mushroom spawn – either made using the DIY technique above, or with a bag of suitable spawn from an online supplier (check which species are good for this garden technique before you buy anything). The next step is to get making your mushroom garden: Wood Blewits: you can use this spawn to inoculate a patch of compost (or tuck it into an existing compost pile, down the bottom) to spread it’s mycelium. You can also use the mushroom garden woodchips technique but Blewits are a great ‘we’ll eat anything’ species when it comes to decomposed woody matter, so they’re great in compost too. King Stopharia: this is a cultivated species (native to Europe and North America) that you can also multiply using this technique – King Stropharia are better suited to pastuerised woodchip gardens – more info on how to make one of those below. Other species – depending where you live, you can try other species using this technique – just make sure that you’re using mushroom species that love decomposed organic material – so NOT things like shiitakes, which prefer fresh(ish) wooden logs. And of course, you don’t have to limit yourself to just one species – you could grow Wood Blewits in one patch, and King Stropharia in another. Just give each of your edible mushroom patches their own space in your garden, so that the mycelium don’t have to spend their energy competing with each other – you want all that energy to go into establishing, and then fruiting into the tasty mushrooms of your choice. This is a common question, and it’s a good one. Yes, you can just go ahead and tuck bits of mushroom stem butts, and mushroom directly, into your compost pile (particularly talking Blewits, here) and…. it may work, sometimes. But because mushrooms are very delicious to lots of life (not just us!), it’s also likely that your mushroom bits will get munched before they’ve had the chance to establish. By using this super-simple DIY mushroom spawn on cardboard technique, you are jump-starting the mushroom’s mycelium back into it’s growth habit, while also, and this is important, providing it with an ideal growing environment (the damp cardboard) where there’s no other bugs/slugs to munch on it, there’s plenty of food, and very little fungal competition from other species for that first crucial phase of mycelial growth. All this extra help to the mycelium means that it will be able to grow strongly – and when you do add your cardboard spawn to your garden, it will be rip-roaring-ready to go – which is what you want. Think of it as planting a healthy seedling, as opposed to a single seed. As a decorative but non-edible garden addition, you could even try establishing the beautiful and bioluminescent Ghost Fungus (Omphalotus nidiformis) which glows in the dark, to light up your garden pathways at night? Any more questions, please ask away below! Always happy to help you get growing 🙂     ;Milkwood
So when I wrote The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook, I wrote about small, positive, everyday changes and habits – that you can consider, try out, and add to your daily life if they suit you. We do not expect you to take on all the habits suggested, or turn your life upside down in  days. Choosing and then taking on one new habit, one new tweaked way of being that leans towards life and towards the futures that we need to co-create, would be a fine start. Because each one of these habits will change the world. That feels like a very big thing to say. In an age of such urgency, of so many over-lapping crises, and living within a decade where if We Don’t Get This Right, Now, all may be lost. Which is all so very true. That urgency is overwhelming, and necessary, and starkly apparent – to more and more of us. And while we hold these truths in our hands, and act upon them collectively to progress liveable futures for all – there is also this day. And the next one. Another breakfast, another work day, another toilet break, another ‘what to make for dinner’ moment. Another day of individual actions, habits. Conscious and unconscious. Voluntary and involuntary. Ideal and non-ideal. Considered and idgaf moments, and choices to be made. The overwhelm of the everyday, to go along with the system-level urgency. Great!   We live under multiple harmful systems – including white supremacy, and capitalism. Many, many aspects of our lives are set up in a way that does not enhance biodiversity, or happiness, or lean towards rest, or community care, or justice.   It is not easy, or even sometimes possible, to untangle ourselves entirely from these systems, in our current lives. And yet. We still get to make choices, each and every day. And we can choose small changes to our ways of living, that can help co-create the worlds we want. Doing any of these actions on your own won’t save the world. But movements are made up of many individuals – making better choices and taking action, together. Some of these choices are made apparent when we fill the streets. Some of these choices are made apparent when we close down the company / win the court case / stop the fossil fuel project / vote through new legislation that protects communities, ecosystems. Some of these choices and actions are done at the the breakfast table, and in the mundane and ordinary places of our day. These quieter aspects, actions and habits are also part of the revolution of change that we need to live within.   They ripple slowly outwards, like a tide of quietly unstoppable force – that cannot be halted, anymore than a tsunami or a waterfall – as we each choose to change our everyday for the better. Droplet by droplet, these everyday actions and choices are an essential part of how we create unstoppable tides and rivers of change.   Collective action comes in many forms. Individual actions can and do change the world, when done collectively. Your choices do matter. Individual people, each making choices on what next to do, is the only thing that has ever changed anything. Movements are made up of exactly this. Its not that doing these everyday actions will ‘save’ the world – it’s that considering your daily habits gives you multiple, precious opportunities to edge towards a deeper relationship with your ecosystem, and your community, and your self. Yes, even as we each live within unjust and hugely destructive systems. Even now.   And the more we can practice living in relationship to these living systems, the more we can cultivate the capacity to co-create the futures we all need and deserve, starting with this day. This one, right here. The day you thought didn’t matter. It’s said in the transformative justice movement that ‘transformation only occurs in relationship’. That is, accountability and healing can only truly occur when there’s dialogue between the parties concerned. When we are entirely seperate and closed off from each other, there is no dialogue possible. And therefore no relational movement forward. No true release from the pain, or the harm. Being in relationship makes everything possible. Ask any functional ecosystem, and it will show you exactly that. The same capacity of transformation can be said regarding your relationship with the earth beneath your feet, and the people in your kitchen. The relationship between you and the plants that grow through the cracks in the pavement outside your apartment. How often are you aware of your inner biome/ecosystem, or your ongoing relationship with your local waterways, or your local food system? How are those relationships going, for you? How often do you check in? How do you seek to contribute to their health, as they do to yours? How much does your awareness of these eco-systemic relationships around you, which infuse your daily life at every level, contribute to your decisions on how to live? Meaningful relationships require regular care, and noticing, and tending. They require consideration. They require us to think beyond ourselves, in our actions and choices. The results of a healthy relationship can be nourishing – and change your mind, and your life for the better. Because transformation can occur only in relationship. Your relationship with your ecosystem is a life-long one, even if it’s largely unnoticed. Your choices matter, and affect things all around you, each and every day. And you have a daily opportunity to consider how to shift these relationships, little by little, with how you eat, play, work, rest, love and generally spend your days on earth – in a way that leans towards life, and away from the harmful systems we need to out-grow. This doesn’t mean that the big actions aren’t also critical. Quite the opposite. But to stay alive, at this time on earth, it’s worth considering how you can hold and participate in that urgency, while also finding small ways to reclaim your place as a helpful, happier, and more aware part of nature. As a being who is slowly learning how to live in right relationship to my local ecosystem, this is all part of it – in amongst all the urgency, and all the grief, and all the possibilities that our world holds. . Because if transformation occurs only in relationship, we cannot help transform a world that does not know us. . forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet, and the winds long to play with your hair ~ Kahlil Gibran . Oh and also, this book was born out of our Permaculture Living course, a mentored, online class we run  times a year. Here’s the course details. The first image is a raw linocut by the amazing Dalee Ella, from our forthcoming book | Image  is the amazing verge gardens of Wilga Ave in Dulwich Hill | Image  is Annie & Genevieve’s wash up (from when they lived in the Love Shack / tinyhouse) | Image  is me in our garden, taken by Sam Shelley | image  is leek flowers in our garden, also taken by Sam. . About The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook – Habits for Hope in a changing world – this is a handbook of good ideas and habits for your every day. Each one of these habits is small, and not revolutionary in and of themselves. And they also are, each of them, fundamentally world-shifting. Each one separates us a little bit more from the systems and structures that have been so toxic to life on earth – each habit opens up space for us to create new futures. Because the change that we need, the worlds that we need, begin now. Each day. They’re not an arrival point in the future. We are co-creating the future every day of our lives, and we can do that in a way that creates more equity, more justice, more deliciousness, and which leans towards life. While just doing our daily stuff. But with meaning, and purpose. This is a handbook for living like it matters.     ;Milkwood
 So – you’re keen to kickstart your household towards resilience, and start making it a Real Thing – but where do you start? What will actually make a difference? And how can you keep your spirits up, and lower your stress levels, and save money, too – while making it all actually happen, at your place? Teaching skills, action and design for Household Resilience is literally our jam. It’s what we do at Milkwood – and have done for + years now. So we gathered  excellent, and actually DOABLE strategies for Household Resilience together for this online workshop we ran a little while back, and now we want to share them with you. Here’s a replay from the live workshop. And below that are the resources mentioned – for you to read, download, and get going with – Now just to be clear – this workshop was all about discussing and showing actual techniques that will actually help your household become more resilient. In All The Ways. Because you know what? Household resilience isn’t about adopting a bunker mentality, or creating a mini-fortress at your place… Household Resilience is about providing for some of your own needs, within reason. However – also essential to household resilience is considering the larger picture, beyond your well-stocked pantry. Because guess what? We all live our lives in relation to our ecosystems and our communities, always – and if they’re not also healthy or resilient, we can’t be, either. So – household resilience is about sorting out the basics, and it’s also about considering what you do, and where you are, and how you can help create stability and resilience beyond your front gate. Here’s some of our favourite Milkwood resources for you – NOTE that every resource below contains lots of links to other great resources…. so you might want to make a cuppa, before you dive in. There’s a LOT in here. We don’t expect to you be able to absorb and take action all the resources above at once… but don’t worry – slowly does it! Our suggestions from here:  And just a few more resources, from questions and contributions that came up during the live sessions:       ;Milkwood
"“Active Hope is about being active participants in bringing about what we hoped for. Active hope is a practice. It is something we do, rather than have. It is a process we can apply in any situation.” ~ Joanna Macy, from her book Active Hope. At the recent Australian Permaculture Convergence, on Paramangk country near Tartanya / Adelaide, I had the honor of co-hosting an amazing conversation on Articulating and Activating Hope with some very excellent humans. It was so good, and touched on so many things that I’ve been thinking about, and longing for, and looking for, these last few years. I started writing about radical hope a few years ago, after re-reading Rebecca Solnit’s Hope in the Dark – Untold Histories, Wild Possibilities, and Jonathon Lear’s Radical Hope – Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation. Since then, it’s been a big  years at our house – getting caught up in devastating bushfires at Mallacoota, and the covid pandemic times, which left no-one untouched or unchanged. I’ve kept reading and thinking about hope, but I wasn’t able to be very articulate about it, when speaking with others, these last few years. Our upcoming book, The Milkwood Permaculture Living Handbook, does centre active hope as a central tool for building strength and capacity, and to create more justice in this world of ours, while keeping our hearts open – but that’s not out in the world, quite yet. So having this conversation, in the arms of the Australian Permaculture Convergence, was important to me. So important that i choked up while preparing for it. While I was preparing, I was re-reading Joanna Macy’s book Active Hope – which conveniently had the same name as this conversation, though I hadn’t been thinking of her book when I proposed the panel. But in the way of knowledge showing up and giving you a reminding shake of the shoulder, as often happens when I’m researching something, this book re-surfaced into my attention. Joanna Macy’s work is so very excellent, and covers so many decades of thoughtful discovery, teaching and learning, with attribution to the knowledge-keepers before her that you don’t often see in writing of past decades. Active Hope is a book that came out of holding many, many workshops on climate grief, as a process and a part of what Macy calls “The Work that Re-connects”. It’s a powerful, and very useful, practical way of defining hope as a pathway forwards. “Whatever situation we face, we can choose our response (within reason). When facing overwhelming challenges we might feel that our actions don’t count for much – yet the responses we make and the degree to which we believe that they count are shaped by the way we think and feel about hope. Hope has a few definitions as defined by the dictionary; the first meaning of Hope is something that is likely to happen. We can be hopeful that from three choices that are already on the table, the one we hope for will be the one that occurs. But there is a second definition of Hope – and this one is all about desire. What do we really want to happen? It is what we do with this kind of hope that really makes the difference. This is not about waiting for external agencies to bring about what we desire. Active hope is about being active participants in bringing about what we hoped for. Active hope is a practice.” Macy then goes on to define the three key steps of active hope, as she articulates and teaches in her workshops: So simple! But also, so often not that easy. And here’s the real kicker: “Since active hope through this process does not require our optimism, we can apply it even in areas where we feel hopeless. The guiding impetus is intention. We choose what we aim to bring about, act for, or express – and then we move in that direction.” Whew! That seemed like a good place to start, especially at a permaculture convergence, in a time of so many overlapping crises. And radical hope had been such an ongoing conversation between me and my mate Hannah Moloney, that having a conversation about it at APC seemed like a great idea. But then, we arrived at APC, and got to meet and hear from the amazing Guy Ritani and Toad Dell of PermaQueer, and the excellent Tiahni Adamson of SeedMob and CH. It became clear to both myself and Hannah that a panel about active hope with these humans would make the conversation  thousand times better. Especially with added Costa Georgiadis, one of the most hopeful humans I have had the pleasure of knowing. And what a conversation it was. So many mic-dropping insights. And excellent minds, and tender hearts, and truthful perspectives – which we really need in this times of everything. Take an hour sometime soon, if you can, and absorb it all: (have to say my fave auto-caption misquote is the wind of tolerance – make that window of tolerance. But all winds in this weather are welcome, also) Active Hope through the lens of a practice is so important. It grounds us into something that we can cultivate – something that we can build our strength towards… and then there’s the role that presence plays in active hope… we have to look, and truth-tell, and see things as they are. Our hope needs to be grounded in the reality of the situations that we’re in – and ensuring that it’s nurturing all of us correctly, so we don’t just angrily yell… finding in that hope the self-sustainability and the transparency within ourselves to be solutions based, and work for a better world, with hope if we keep using blunt language we can create despair… language is often underestimated – if we can apply language as a tool, it becomes part of the practice, on a path of intent, towards hope you hear people going oh yeah, I did that activism thing in my teens my s my s and then I had to stop… I’m like no no – it’s not a thing we do on the weekend, or a thing we do when we’re young, it’s a life commitment, it’s a lifestyle – and it’s awesome when you just find what works for you people hold knowledge collectively… there’s not an individualist, lone rugged individual who is the hopeful one… transformation occurs only in relationship… I need to be in many different relationships holding the capacity to change – that’s really where we hold hope. Big, beautiful thanks to all the amazing volunteers of Permaculture SA for hosting us and holding us all during this nourishing and excellent convergence, and for recording the talks on the main stage. Thanks extra to Tim the sound person, for wrangling many microphones. Thanks to the fabulous Meg McGowan for introducing the panel (and being excellent, besides), to Permaculture Australia for their part of APC , and to Brenna Quinlan, Linda Woodrow and many others who nourished my brain and heart over the weekend. And thanks again for the conversation – Hannah, Guy, Toad, Costa and Tiahni. I came away from this convergence re-energised and excited – about the role that permaculture design thinking has played, and how it can continue to contribute – in both legacies and futures of active hope, and effective, grass-roots design strategies… for crisis and mutual aid, and also for the futures that we need to build, piece by piece and day by day, together.  … hope is in the domain of the heart, not only in the head… it’s important for us to continue creating spaces, because we can lead from that space… and we lead most effectively when we’re creating environments where others can dream and others can hope from.

There’s SO many awesome mushrooms out there to learn to grow – so where do you start? We thought it’s high time we shared our  Best Mushrooms to Grow at Home, for beginners. Ok so by ‘best’ I mean ‘favourite’, I guess. But we’ve also selected these ten species because they are all easy to get started with as a beginner grower, compared to some other wonderful but trickier-to-grow mushrooms. Easy doesn’t mean boring, though! In the knowledge below you’ll meet some of the most delicious, medicinal and beautiful mushrooms on the planet. This article will give you a rundown of  different species that you can learn to cultivate with one or more basic methods, at home, using low-waste techniques (plastic bags begone!). And firstly – a note – this is all about growing mushrooms from scratch, at home. It’s not about mushroom fruiting kits. While kits look great when they’re fruiting on your bench, they’re not a very economical (or environmentally friendly) way to grow more than a handful of mushrooms at home. But they can make your heart skip with how cool fruiting mushrooms are, so that’s a good thing. Anyway – on to the good stuff of actual home mushroom growing… This article is intended to introduce you cordially to  of our favourite edible and medicinal mushroom species, and what they need to grow, if you want to cultivate them at home. From there, you can read on through our resources, and learn the how of it all. To learn more about the different growing techniques to grow these mushrooms, you can head to our beginner mushroom growing guide, our free mini-course, all our mushroom growing resources, or our short courses. I must add that we also teach a complete Home Mushroom Cultivation course, but if you’re doing that one, you don’t need this article – because you’ve got access to all this knowledge, and much more, inside your course! And if you’d like to dig deeper into the kind of fungi we’re talking about here (there’s a whole world of them!), head to our Life Cycle of Fungi rundown. Lastly, most of these mushrooms can also be grown in jars using sterile culture techniques, but we don’t recommend you start there – get some low-tech beginner skills first, have your mind blown by the world of fungi, then learn more advanced techniques once you’ve got your mushroom growing game on. Alrighty then – let’s go meet some mushrooms…  Family: Pleurotaceae. Genus: Pleurotus. Species: ostreatus. Common names: Oyster Mushroom, Tree Oyster, Oyster Shelf, Straw Mushroom, Hiratake, Tamogitake. Ecology: Saprobic – primary decomposer – this kind of mushroom’s mycelium eats certain kinds of raw organic material, like straw or sawdust This is by far the easiest mushroom to cultivate. This species includes the different varieties: Pearl, White and Tan oyster to name a few. It is said to originate from North America and Europe, but they grow in hardwood and fir forests all around the world. Fun fact: Oyster Mushrooms are carnivorous. They can devour any small critter that tries to eat their mycelium, which is why they are such effective myceliators of substrate! Harvest your Oysters before the cap goes from concave to convex, if you leave them too long they’ll start to become brittle, won’t hold their shape while you cook them and smell quite fishy. On Pasteurized Substrate: in buckets or bags – beginner level. For it’s substrate, this species likes straw / hardwood sawdust / all kinds of agricultural wastes, amended with up to % bran. In Garden Beds: beginner level. Oysters love straw or strawbales. On Logs: beginner level. This species likes to grow on alder, aspen, beech, birch, elm, maple, oak, poplar, willow. For indoor (bucket) cultivation, Pleurotus ostreatus likes an incubation temperature of around  °C /  °F. Incubation takes about  days. They fruit best between °C /  °F and °C /  °F, and like a humidity of %. We use these mushrooms for prettymuch everything you can think of – mushroom mince, stirfries, dumplings, mushroom jerky, mushroom pickles and on and on. Meat-free Oyster Mushroom “bone broth” is extra delicious and healing. To learn more about how to grow these from scratch at home, with low waste techniques – head to our beginner guides & resources, plus all our mushroom cultivation articles are here.  Family: Omphalotaceae. Genus: Lentinula. Species: edodes. Common names: Shiitake, Golden Oak Mushroom Ecology: Saprobic – primary decomposer Log cultivation of Shiitake mushrooms in Japan dates back to at least  years. It is a true saprophyte, in other words it only grows on dead wood. Shiitake has antibacterial qualities and is very rich in beta-glucans which are anti-inflammatory. Shiitake is the second most grown mushroom in the world, next to the common button mushroom and is easy and fun to grow on logs. On Logs: beginner level. This species likes to grow on the wood of oak, beech or chestnut (preferred) but we’ve found they also do well on acacia, alder, ash, eucalyptus (thin barked ones like spotted or manna gum), hickory or liquid amber (sweetgum). For outdoor cultivation, Lentinula edodes likes a mild and shady spot, with relatively high humidity. You should see signs of fruiting within - months of log inoculation. Shiitake have a very similar texture to fresh porcini mushrooms, and can be used interchangeably in pastas and risottos, dried and preserved. They are perfect for making the Japanese stock dashi. Here’s a beginners guide, a video article, and a short course on log cultivation which features shiitake growing.  Family: Strophariaceae. Genus: Stropharia. Species: rugosoannulata. Common names: King Stropharia, Garden Giant, Burgundy Mushroom, Wine Caps, Wine Red Stropharia Ecology: Saprobic (secondary decomposer) The King Stropharia has a beautiful dark reddish-purple pileus and greenish grey gills. They are easy to grow outdoors in beds of fermented hardwood wood chips or straw inoculated with grain, sawdust or cardboard spawn. Cardboard spawn can be made by placing harvested stem butts in damp cardboard. They can be difficult to cultivate indoors as they prefer a complex microbe-rich substrate. This fungi thrives in subtropical to cool temperate climates. The mushrooms can grow to be very large, but they’re best picked when they’re young and firm. Can be used to remediate excess nitrogen in chicken runs. S. rugosoannulata mycelium can also kill and trap soil nematodes. In Gardens: beginner level. This species likes to grow on fermented straw / older hardwood chips / cardboard / leaves. Bacterial rich soil or compost casing layer can help stimulate fruiting. For outdoor cultivation, Stropharia rugosoannulata has a few particular needs and temperature considerations to grow well, which are outlined in the resources below. Harvest when approximately - cm wide, cut in half (no need to thinly slice) and braise. These mushrooms are really delicious with mustard or red wine sauce. Must be eaten cooked as they can cause digestive upset when eaten raw. Here’s a mini workshop we made about garden cultivation, and we also have a short course on garden cultivation, which features King Stropharia  Family: Physalacriaceae. Genus: Flammulina. Species: velutipes. Common names: Enoki, Velvet Shank Ecology: Saprobic (primary decomposer) Wild enokitake looks very different from commercially cultivated enokitake. While the commercial stuff is almost white in colour and clumped together very densely, the wild mushrooms are recognisable through the following traits: Enokitake is best cultivated in the garden on logs and stumps and can withstand very cold temperatures (it’s known as the snow mushroom for a reason!). on Logs: beginner level. Enokitake likes to grow on fresh hardwood logs or stumps. Inoculate above ground – allowing them to colonise for  months. Good results can be obtained by using the ‘raft’ method – burying in a layer of fresh hardwood chips. Will fruit in the colder months. in Gardens: ‘give-it-a-go’ level. We’ve had patchy success transferring a handful of enokitake mycelium to sawdust mulch below various perennials, like currants, and just letting it live it’s best life. It works sometimes! Enokitake mushrooms that are grown indoors (with the familiar elongated white appearance) – are commonly eaten fresh – sprinkled over salads, as a garnish, or floated in soups and broths. For the outdoor ones – either cultivated or foraged – they are amazing lightly fried. I’ve also brined them using a lacto-ferment – recipe here – and they were deeelish. Here’s a beginners guide, a video article, and a shot course on log cultivation which can be used for enokitake. And here’s our article about growing enoki underneath currant bushes.  Family: Pleurotaceae. Genus: Pleurotus. Species: eryngii. Common names: King Oyster, King Trumpet Mushroom, French Horn Mushroom, King Brown Mushroom, Boletus of the Steppes, Trumpet Royale, Seta de Cardo (Spanish) Ecology: Saprobic (primary decomposer) King Oyster mushrooms have a convex cap becoming funnel-shaped with big and robust stems. Unlike other Pleurotus spp. they often grow vertically out of the top of their substrate, which why they get a special mention here – they are big! And also very meaty and delicious. Several new varieties and hybrids of P. eryngii and P. ostreatus (such as Black Pearl King Oyster) have recently become available. King Oysters get their species name – eryngii – due to their habit of growing off the roots and decaying matter of Eryngium spp. of plants such as the beautiful but spikey Sea Holly and Field Eryngo. In the mountains of northern Spain where this mushroom grows wild with these plants, it is also known as Seta de Cardo (arrow of the thistle). Unlike other oyster mushrooms, P. eryngii can sometimes thrive growing in soil and thus has great potential for bioremediation. King oysters tend to yield better on logs or sawdust rather than in pure straw, but if you can grow some Eryngium spp. on plants you may have better results. In Buckets / Bags: beginner/intermediate (depending on your climate): King oysters like a : hardwood sawdust to straw or other agricultural wastes amended with up to % bran or cottonseed meal. Use holes in lid of bucket only and leave cm / ″” of space or ‘head room’ in the top of the bucket. Remove the lid when ready to fruit. In Gardens: beginner/intermediate (depending on your climate): King oysters like mounds of straw / sawdust cased with soil, especially in a garden planted with Eryngium spp. (Sea Holly) On Logs: beginner/intermediate (depending on your climate): King oyster plus will grow on most hardwoods inc alder, aspen, ash, beech, birch, elm, maple, oak, poplar, willow. For indoor (bucket) cultivation, Pleurotus eryngii likes an incubation temperature of around  °C /  °F. Incubation takes about  days. They fruit best between  °C /  °F and  °C /  °F, and like a humidity of %. Make the most of the thick stems of these mushrooms by slicing them into thick steaks and frying in butter. The outside becomes gold and crispy while the inside is like soft abalone. Try this recipe – Trumpet Mushroom Scallops with Brown Butter and Thyme. To learn more about how to grow these from scratch at home, with low waste techniques – head to our beginner guides & resources, plus all our mushroom cultivation articles are here.  Family: Hericiaceae. Genus: Hericium. Species: erinaceus / coralloides. Common names: Lion’s Mane, Monkey’s Head, Sheep’s Head, Old Man’s Beard, Hedgehog Mushroom, Pom Pom, Yamabushitake Ecology: Saprobic (primary decomposer) H. erinaceus is very similar to H. coralloides (Coral Tooth Fungi – also sold as Australian Lions’ Mane). This is a stunning fungus, resembling a mane of falling white spikes. It naturally appears on the wounds of living or very recently cut hardwoods in temperate climates, but it can be grown in jars of sawdust or on logs. The mycelium is weak and wispy and can be hard to distinguish from contamination. It can be tricky to get the mycelium growing and when grown in containers it requires sterile substrates but it is quite easy to fruit even in poor conditions. We’ve had jars produce many flushes even  months after inoculation. The positive effects of this fungi on the brain’s cognitive function have been extensively studied.If cooking, harvest while young and firm for the best texture. On Logs: beginner/intermediate: Lions Mane likes to grow on logs or stumps, preferably in contact with the earth. Plant logs vertically in sandy soil in shady spots with / buried. Does well on logs of beech, elm, maple, oak, possibly others including fir. Not alder or birch. Lion’s mane has a flavour reminiscent of lobster which makes it perfect for replacing crab in recipes. Absolutely delicious. Also try adding it to pizzas or a miso broth. Try this recipe for lion’s mane ‘crab’ cakes. Lions Mane is also highly medicinal, in lots of ways. Here’s a beginners guide, a video article, and a shot course on log cultivation which can be used for lions mane. You can also use this simple tincture recipe for lions mane.  Family: Pleurotaceae. Genus: Pleurotus. Species: djamor. Common names: Pink Oyster, Salmon Oyster, Strawberry Oyster, Flamingo Oyster, Takiiro Hiratake, Tabang Ngungut (Borneo) Ecology: Saprobic (primary decomposer) This oyster variety gets a special mention because we love it! Pink oysters form beautiful, vibrantly pink ‘bouquets’ of fruiting bodies. The pink fades as the mushrooms age and as you cook them, but the pink IS preserved when you dry them. The mycelium can be very thin and wispy and can be easily confused with contamination. Easy to cultivate and incredibly fast to grow in summer or in subtropical climates, making it a good choice for growing on fresh, used coffee grounds as this ‘rich’ substrate often results in contamination with slower growing species. This fungus loves hot humid days, which makes it a good summer oyster mushroom strain. On Pasteurized Substrate: in buckets or bags – beginner level. For it’s substrate, this species likes straw or bagasse or hardwood sawdust supplemented w/ up to % bran or % used fresh coffee grounds. In Garden Beds: beginner level. Use straw or strawbales On Logs: beginner level. This species likes to grow on alder, aspen, beech, birch, elm, maple, oak, poplar, willow. For indoor (bucket) cultivation, Pleurotus djamor likes an incubation temperature of around  °C /  °F. Incubation takes about  days. They fruit best between  °C /  °F and  °C /  °F, and like a humidity of %. Use similarly to Pleurotus ostreatus. Unfortunately the delightful pink colour of these mushrooms cooks out. But as said, the colour is retained when dried. Great candidate for jerky or mushroom ‘bacon’ recipes. To learn more about how to grow these from scratch at home, with low waste techniques – head to our beginner guides & resources, plus all our mushroom cultivation articles are here.  Family: Polyporaceae. Genus: Trametes / Coriolus. Species: versicolor. Common names: Turkey Tail, Many Coloured Polypore, Kawaratake, Yun Zhi, Cloud Mushroom Ecology: Saprobic (primary decomposer) Known as either Coriolus versicolor, Trames versicolor or Turkey Tails, these are small bracket fungi with fuzzy caps featuring defined bands of different colours, including various shades of cream, grey, yellow, orange and brown resembling… wait for it.. a turkey tail. The cap is thin and flexible and the whitish brown underside is covered with small pores. Trametes species are common all over the world so they are easy to find when foraging (see link below) and often grow on your logs when you are trying to grow something else like Shiitake. T. versicolor can be difficult to distinguish from many of its close relatives but there are supposedly no poisonous Trametes species. Be careful of similar-looking Stereum spp and others. Trametes versicolor is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a tonic, and studies suggest that it has immunostimulant and antitumor properties. Polysaccharide-K (PSK), a proprietary product derived from Trametes, was developed for cancer treatment in Japan. Trametes can be grown sawdust or even more easily on logs. On Pasteurized Substrate: in buckets or bags – beginner/intermediate. For it’s substrate, this species likes hardwood sawdust / wood chips supplemented with up to % bran. On Logs: beginner/intermediate: Turkey Tail likes to grow on logs laid on the ground or stumps, preferably in contact with the earth. Plant logs vertically in sandy soil with / buried or in plastic pots covered with hardwood sawdust, then sand. Does well on logs of alder, aspen, eucalyptus, elm, oak, poplar, just about any hardwood. Best consumed steeped in hot water as a tea, added when making a stock (simmer for at least  hours) or as a tincture. See our article on Foraging and Using Turkey Tail Mushrooms – including basic tincture recipe, also this great article on identifying true Turkey Tails. And here’s an in-point to the land of research on turkey tails health benefits. Here’s a beginners guide, a video article, and a shot course on log cultivation which can be used for turkey tails.  Family: Tricholomataceae. Genus: Clitocybe / Lepista. Species: nuda. Common names: Wood Blewit Ecology: Saprobic (secondary decomposer) A stunning mushroom with vibrant lilac coloured gills and stipe while it’s young, with a tan coloured cap. The purple colouring fades with maturity and with cooking. The mycelium is wispy with a lovely blue/lilac colour too, while the spores are blush or dusty pink. Native to Europe and North America, but naturalised in many parts of the world (including Australia), wood blewits fruit in late autumn to early spring in woodland areas, in temperate climates. They are a perfect candidate for growing in mushroom gardens. Blewits thrive on a complex substrate of multiple organic materials, including partially decomposed yard waste, twigs, leaves, grass clippings, bark, hay, pine needles, and compost. Look for a shady area in your yard to cultivate these, where you’ll have easy access to water, and the bed is protected from the elements. We’ve also had great success establishing blewits by adding stem butts from wild specimens to maturing compost and then using the resulting myceliated compost to establish beds in the garden. Build beds in the autumn/fall or spring, when it is as cool as possible but with low risk of frost and keep moist all year. Garden beds will likely take a year to fully myceliate and fruit. This species is not suitable for tropical climates.  In Garden Beds: beginner level. This species grows well on ermented straw / older hardwood chips / cardboard / leaves w/ bacterial rich soil or compost. These mushrooms have a lightly citrusy smell, and hold their shape when cooked. They are one of those mushrooms that MUST only be consumed well-cooked, to break down tummy-upsetting compounds. Pairs well with sage. Try this Pan Roasted Blewits with Sage, or this Wood Blewit and Spaghetti Squash Gratin. Here’s a mini workshop we made about garden cultivation, and we also have a short course on garden cultivation, which can be used for wood blewits. Here’s some more great tips for growing wood blewits from the folks at Field & Forest.  Read and watched all our free mushroom guides, courses and resources?

Growing your own food is one of the most life-affirming things you can do AND you get to eat delicious veggies as a result. And it’s totally possible, even if you live in a small space or rental, or have a super-tight budget to work within.  To help get you started, Anna Matilda from The Urban Nanna is going to show you six simple things you can try right away, no matter where you live, to start to grow food while renting. Take it away, Anna… Over the past  years, I’ve lived in eight different rentals – and in every single one of them, I’ve managed to grow some of my own veggies and fruit. I don’t attempt to grow everything I eat though. I live on my own, and between working and writing and running workshops and basic life admin, I don’t have anywhere near enough time or energy for intensive food gardening. But I definitely do want to grow some of what I eat – and I manage to do that using very little money and time, and all within the small courtyard of my rental property. Essentially, I use permaculture thinking and design to inform my gardening processes – attempting to reuse and recycle wherever I can, stack functions, obtain as much of a yield or harvest as possible, and really get the most out of my small space. Here are six ways of thinking and methods I always use, which might work for you, in your rental, too… If you know there isn’t space for you to grow heaps, maybe focus on growing short-term, high yield crops such as lettuce, herbs, spring onions and radish. If you work long hours and know you’ll only get out in the garden once a month, don’t plant things that need regular supervision. If you know you’ll be moving out in  to  months, maybe resist the urge to plant garlic and cabbage in the ground (both take ages to grow). Don’t plant out a whole load of seeds if you know you’re going away and won’t be able to care for them when they’ve sprouted.  Essentially, be honest with yourself about your capacity to actively care for growing plants. Apply self-regulation and accept feedback (permaculture principle ). Don’t overcommit. Plan well. And then garden strategically. Growing in pots is the best-ever solution to growing any long-term plants as a renter. I have an apricot and a medlar tree that have lived in five houses with me, and they both regularly fruit. I also have a thriving rhubarb collection and a few asparagus crowns too.  Keeping things in pots also means you can adjust your growing to suit the seasons more effectively than if you were using an in-ground bed. It means you can plant things immediately after moving in, because you’ll be able to move the pots if it turns out you picked a spot that the possums regularly get to, or that doesn’t get enough sunlight. Likewise, you can shift things around to suit the seasons: make use of the trapped thermal mass of a bricked courtyard in winter, and then move tender plants away before it becomes an oven in summer.  Whether you’re looking at growing in pots or in a garden bed, the no-dig method of building soil is brilliant. Unlike using commercially produced ‘garden soil’ (which is often filled with chemical nasties and ends up leached of nutrients within a few months), no-dig layers break down into a nutrient-rich soil that’s full of beneficial beasties and bacteria, greatly reducing the need to add artificial feeders. Learn more about growing food using no-dig layers in pots here, and here’s some on no-dig layers in larger beds.  If you happen to have a driveway or communal area where there’s a narrow verge of grass or soil, build up a few no-dig layers on top and plant some climbing plants. Peas, beans, tomatoes, cucumber, tromboncino, all love a sheltered sunny spot so are great for this. Use string, chicken wire or even bedheads to support their upward growth without damaging the fencing.  Growing from seed isn’t too difficult – after all, plants have been doing it in spite of humans for millennia. And it’s a heck of a lot cheaper than buying seedlings. Start with something easy such as nasturtium, lettuce and broad beans, if you want some confidence boosting. You don’t need special equipment to grow seeds. Many are happy being directly planted in their pots or soil. Some prefer to be raised more gently first, which you can do in any container of seed-raising mix with holes in the bottom. You can do this indoors (laundry or bathroom benches work well), or inside a clear plastic tub or greenhouse. Read the packet instructions to help guide you. And don’t forget to start saving seeds yourself. If you have the space, get a compost heap happening. It doesn’t have to be a massive hot-composting system – I built up my system slowly by using modified -litre bins that I keep in a shady corner of the yard. This Composting Guide for Beginners has everything you need to know to get started. If you don’t have space for a compost system, maybe you can set up a small worm farm. It’ll take care of lots of your food waste, and provide fertiliser for your garden.  And if you don’t have room for that, maybe look into making your own fertiliser by making weed tea, or banana skin tea or simply by tipping tea leaves or coffee grounds into your veggie pots.  Whatever you choose, just aim at doing one thing that will help transform what would have been your waste into something that you would otherwise have bought wrapped in plastic from the garden nursery.  There’s so much more to share, but hopefully this list helps encourage you to start permaculture living in your rental: it’s totally doable if you start small and build on your successes. Remember – from little things, big things grow.

"Getting your seed-raising mix just right is super important for growing strong seedlings, which in turn become strong plants that produce mountains of edible deliciousness for you. While you can buy mixes from the shops, making your own is much cheaper and usually assures a higher-quality result than a commercial seed-raising mix. Plus, you get to side-step the plastic bags that store-bought seed-raising mix usually comes wrapped in. And then, you have a homemade mix to carefully plant your seeds into, perhaps protecting them within the warmth of your kitchen or greenhouse. You watch closely until the first green leaves emerge. Then the potting on, and all the careful stewarding and watering until the seedlings are huge and its finally time to plant them out. And, finally, after much love and attention, you’re onto harvesting – and all that eating, and maybe saving a few seeds for next season too. So, on the cycle goes. Making your own seed-raising mix is easy to do – you only need four simple ingredients – and the results are so worth it. Ready to learn this great fundamental skill of edible gardening? In the past we’ve used a seed-raising mix recipe that was taught to us by Joyce and Mike of Allsun Farm on the southern tablelands of New South Wales. Joyce and Mike are organic growers who are famous for their fabulous tomato seedlings. Over the years, as we’ve experimented and refined this process, we’ve varied the recipe slightly to use the lowest footprint and most locally available materials we can find. You can use whatever you like for your ‘part’ measure – a cup, a bucket or whatever makes sense for the quantity
you’re preparing. Worm castings are the gorgeous black sludge you find at the bottom of your worm farm. This sludge is nitrogendense and fabulous food for young plants. If you can’t lay your hands on any, just use  parts compost instead of . Coir fibre is the pulverised husk of coconuts. It holds water very well so it acts as a wetting agent for the rest of the mix. Being a waste product, super-cheap and readily available where we are, it’s great for this task. You may find another or a better material where you live. Avoid using peat/sphagnum moss – while it’s often recommended for seed-raising mixes, it’s harvested from moss bogs that would otherwise provide important carbon sinks. Coir is a much better choice. Alright, so you’ve created your seed-raising mix and you’re ready to get growing. Here’s what to do next… Fill your seedling tray, pots, empty toilet rolls or whatever it is you are using, and carefully level it all off. Gently tamp the soil using two fingers – just lightly pressing down; you don’t want to compact the soil here at all. But you do want to eliminate air pockets. Once this is done, top the containers up and again gently level it off. Using a pen as a dibber, go down as far as you need to for the seeds that you are planting. Each seed has a different ideal depth, so check on the back of the packet for what your seeds need. Drop two to three seeds into the hole, and gently cover it over again with some of your seed-raising mix. And don’t forget to label what you have just planted as soon as it goes in! A chalk pen is super handy for this, if you’re working with black pots of seed trays. Or you might be able to reuse paddle pop sticks, or chop up a plastic container and write onto that. Over the next few days, gently mist your seedlings daily to keep them moist, until the first leaves appear. Misting is usually better than straight-out watering, which might dislodge the very young roots of your shooting seeds and kill the plant before it even has a chance to poke its head above the soil. Your seedlings will first produce a pair of ‘cotyledons’ – the very first leaves, which often look a bit different to the plant’s true leaves. Keep waiting and watering; with a bit more time you’ll see the true leaves emerge. Once your seedling has several true leaves and is looking happy and study, you can either pot it on to a larger pot, or start ‘hardening off’ (placing your place outside during the day to get used to full weather conditions) before planting fully out. Happy growing, lovely! In the many, MANY years we’ve been making and sharing this seed-raising mix recipe, we’ve watched so many of you give it a go with huge success. Here’s a few recent photos we’ve loved of your seed-raising efforts. Please do tag us on social media if you try this recipe, so we can cheer you on!

A wild food map is a simple way to identify and keep track of all the places where edible weeds, feral fruit, medicinal mushrooms and other yum things grow in your local area – so that, come late summer and autumn, many a happy weekend can be spent finding, picking and eating the bounty. Free, local food. So good… Foraging for weeds, wild food and feral fruit is a simple art and a pleasure that’s available to absolutely anyone. You don’t need a backyard, or a garden, or a farm – you can live in a high-rise apartment and still become a competent forager. All you need is a willingness to learn, good information and the eyes to see. Foraging also connects our palates with our local terroir like few other foods we have access to. It allows us to source local, seasonal food with zero food miles and removes many of the unknowns about how that food was produced. We know what we’re eating and what it took to get these apples or those mulberries from where they grew, into our kitchen. And that is a very good thing. So – let’s take a look at a few different ways to create your own seasonal wild food map, either on paper or online, to help you catalogue all the delicious, edible resources growing near you. First up, a piece of advice: early spring is a great time to get started, because early spring is blossom time – and eye-catching flowers can be the perfect way to figure out where all your local feral fruit trees are. Self-seeded fruit trees in culverts, old orchards on abandoned sites, food trees hanging over the fence into the back laneway – it’s all what is known as ‘feral fruit’. And it’s one of the best, if unheralded, community resources an area has – whether you be in an inner-city suburb or out in the middle of nowhere. Take a walk or a drive around your area and this will become mightily apparent. And with these beacons of blossom, you can map out the feral fruit of your area. All you need is a map, pen and paper, and your eyes. The point of this system is this: we all see fruit trees flowering in spring. We seldom remember where they were by late summer, when everything is green and lush and the fruit is hard to see. So, hunt down this wonderful community resource when the time is right. Later in the piece you’ll probably want to do a round-up of what trees have ended up fruiting, say in mid-summer. Lots of flowers do not mean lots of fruit necessarily, so checking is a good idea. Also, everything ripens at its own time, so from mid-summer on you may want to do a round of your map every two weeks or so. The more feral fruit trees you find and put on your map, the better your chances are of getting a harvest. Self-seeded trees, old, un-renovated trees and even lovingly cared-for trees don’t always bear much fruit, or yummy fruit, necessarily. It depends on the year and, to a degree, luck. Once you’re confident with fruit and nut trees? It’s time to get started with mapping edible weeds, wild medicinal fungi, verge-side herb hedges and anything else you spot in your neighbourhood that would be tasty to forage. A wild food map sketched onto paper can be a thing of beauty – a talking point in your household, a physical reminder to get outside and check all those feral fruit trees, and a knowledge-base that grows stronger over time. Here’s how to create one for your ‘hood: If a digital map is more your style, you might like to investigate one of these many, deeply excellent initiatives (or start your own local online map!): And I need to mention Fallen Fruit also – LA based fruit mappers/artists: “Using fruit as our lens, Fallen Fruit investigates urban space, ideas of neighborhood and new forms of located citizenship and community. From protests to proposals for new urban green spaces, we aim to reconfigure the relation between those who have resources and those who do not, to examine the nature of and in the city, and to investigate new, shared forms of land use and property.” So good! Here they are on Facebook too. But surely that’s not it? Anyone got any other leads? Or maps? Or community initiatives? Perhaps, as my own mother pointed out (who is a feral fruitier from way back) some folks keep the location of their secret peach trees to themselves… but I say that resource shared is a resource expanded so – any other leads on like-minded projects? Let me know in the comments below, plz. A resource shared is a resource made real. So get others in on the act. This could be over a cup of tea, with you sticking your wild food map in their face and imploring them to add to it, or perhaps putting your map online somewhere and inviting people to add to it (or to send you details of trees to add to it yourself). There are a gazillion and one ways of sharing this information, but a couple of quick examples: If you’re shy about contacting people directly to contribute, stick up a sign or two wherever is relevant (pole, community board) or just chalk the URL onto the pavement at various street corners. You could even print out some copies of the URL plus a brief description, then letterbox-drop your area, inviting people to add to it. And if no one else responds – hey, more feral fruit for you! Just don’t get a tummy ache from eating too much autumn goodness when the time comes… But – why bother doing all this in the first place? Well, foraging connects us with the world, and with each other, in many different ways. Pattern recognition takes up a large part of the human brain. Traditionally, learning and knowing the patterns of which leaves and berries to eat and which ones to leave alone was central to life (quite literally). Once you know what you’re doing, thanks to our capacity for recognising and remembering patterns, spotting a plum tree at a distance becomes as obvious as looking at a tomato. And this is permaculture in action, folks – a way to practice the principle ‘Design From Patterns to Details’ in your everyday life. Foraging around where you live, or in a place that you visit often, also embeds you in a place like few other activities can. A map grows in your head (and hopefully on paper too) of your local park, gully, headland or railway easement, with points of reference that are different from how you would usually see the local environment. And at the end of it all, you get delicious, local, seasonal food to eat, enjoy and share – zero food miles or single-use plastics involved. Hurrah. Resources held in common good on common ground are best treated as just that – a common resource, not just for you. So – if the plum tree you’ve found down the gully is full of ripe plums, it doesn’t mean you need to harvest  buckets-full if you will, in fact, only use three. Harvest three buckets instead and tell your friends where the tree is. Leaving plums on the tree is not wasting them. It’s allowing for other possibilities, outside your small reckoning. Use what you harvest and use every bit. Consider also that you may not be the only forager of this tree. This is gratitude, and ethical foraging.     ;Milkwood
"So you’ve heard about permaculture living and reckon it sounds great, but aren’t quite sure how to get started while you’re living in a rental? Today, Anna Matilda from The Urban Nanna is going to show us  simple things you can try right away, no matter where you live – no garden required either. Take it away, Anna… For lots of people, the image that springs to mind when thinking about permaculture living is large thriving veggie gardens, composting toilets and perhaps even a goat or two. All of which can be tricky to do when renting in cities or suburbia. It’s often not possible to make major alterations to a rental property, such as installing solar panels to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, or double-glazing windows to regulate household temperatures. But that doesn’t mean you can’t integrate the permaculture principles into your home – you just have to get creative with your thinking. I’ve lived in eight different rentals over the last  years, which has forced me to apply self-regulation and accept feedback (permaculture principle ) in lots of areas of my life. Luckily, permaculture is about much more than growing food and composting. The foundational ethics of Earth Care, People Care and Fair Share remind us that living a sustainable and eco-conscious life involves all aspects of our existence. These ethics call for us to consider how we interact with others and the world around us – and we can do this at all times, whether we live in a rented city apartment or a sprawling farm. So – here are  things I consider every time I have to move to a new rental property. I’ve found it easier and easier to live by permaculture principles as these things become ingrained in my thinking, so hopefully they can help you on your journey too. When you start looking for a rental, be honest with yourself about how much space you really need for things you know will make your life easier for permaculture living – space for air-drying clothes, cupboards for empty jars and preserved food, compost capacity and proximity to public transport, work, greengrocers, bulk food stores and foraging opportunities.  If you have the things around you that you want and need to live more sustainably, you will find it much easier to do so.  As much as you might like to believe you will ‘do all the things’, it pays to apply self-regulation and accept feedback (principle ) about how likely you are to fit everything into your existing schedule. A property with a huge space for growing food is all well and great, but if it goes unused, it becomes a wasted community resource. This actually begins before you’ve even signed a lease. Find out about the rental agency if you’re using one. Some are more dedicated to tenant quality of life and sustainability than others. Do they have useful information on their website? Or a newsletter? Do they seem like the type of people who are going to support you in your endeavours to live a permaculture lifestyle? My current agency doesn’t have much on their website, but I found out that their monthly tenant’s newsletter always contains articles about how to live more sustainably as a renter: they’ve covered composting, ways to reduce your heating bill, growing food, saving water and more.  Chat to the agent – find out if they know the landlord well (often yes), and suss out if they think the landlord would be open to things like gardens, watertanks, changing showerheads or toilet cisterns to be more water efficient, or perhaps even permitting you to keep chooks or quail. A goat’s probably a bit much for most suburban landlords, but you never know until you ask, right?  Once you’re settled into a rental, keep these channels of communication open – it’s great to do semi-regular email check ins, so it’s not just when you ‘need something’ that you contact them. This helps create a sense of community around your living place. In suburban Australia, you generally don’t have a say over who your water provider is, but when it comes to gas, electricity, and internet, you get to decide who to spend your energy-bucks with. So, when it’s time to set up a new rental, it’s worth doing a little homework first.  Different providers have different commitments to environmental sustainability, and while most now have a carbon-offset billing option, there’s potentially more positive change you can do with your choice. Compare your providers on a site such as Canstar Blue and do a bit of reading on the individual providers’ websites too (just keep an eye out for greenwashing). The Green Electricity Guide of  ranked all of Australia’s electricity providers in terms of environmental impact, and you can use this Canstar Blue site on ‘green energy providers’ to help you learn a bit more about your options.  Oh, and if you’re in a share-house situation, you could always do some research and then start a discussion with your housemates about the possibility of transitioning to a better provider if you aren’t keen on the one they’re with already. Have you ever done a household waste audit – really looked at how much waste you generate on a weekly basis? It can be so useful as the springboard for setting up an efficient waste-management system. One bin is so s! So – visit your local council’s website to find out what is recycled and collected in your area. List the types of things you use regularly that routinely need replacing or go into generate waste.  Then, set up a recycling station, separating these things out into suitably sized containers. Label them so everyone in the house can put things where they belong, and find out where your closest drop-off/collection point is so you know where to go once it’s time.  Here’s some common ‘waste’ items and ideas for managing them with a permaculture approach:  EXTRA TIP: Pens, plastic toothbrushes, medication blister packs, razors, makeup and toiletry tubes, toys, coffee pods, and many other things you wouldn’t imagine are recyclable can actually be dropped off at various Terracycle collection points for recycling. So create separate bins or containers for the things you use, and you’ll be set up for success. In the same way we dress for the weather, dressing your home space can make it much better suited to permaculture living. Historically, Australian homes weren’t designed to cope with the weather we have here, so renters (particularly in older buildings) often feel the brunt of winter chills and scorching summers. Bringing your own curtains, rugs, and quilts can really help with this. When you move into a new place, replace the existing curtains with your own to help reduce heat transfer via windows. You can often find really good quality curtains at op shops or in online swap groups, and additional fixings can be found at hardware stores if they’re required. This also makes your exit-clean cheaper, as you won’t have to steam clean the original curtains when it’s time to vacate. Likewise, rugs reduce the amount of chill rising from the floors (and also reduce wear and tear on the original floor coverings). And you might think quilts are just for snuggling under, but just like a good coat, they can also be used for keeping the chill away in your home. Hanging quilts or blankets from a doorway can keep heat more effectively trapped (or excluded) from a room, and if you can McGyver a hanging system with a pole and some hooks, you can even use them as wall hangings to add warmth in the winter months. Get to know your local area, and the existing community groups around you. Ask at the local library or community neighbourhood house if they know of any gardening, cooking, building or otherwise permie-friendly groups and see if you can join up. Look for things like crop swaps, community gardens, neighbourhood greening programs, wildlife protection groups and the like. While you’re at it, find out what kinds of programs the community house offers – more and more, community spaces are offering free or very affordable classes on practical skills such as preserving, gardening, mending, baking and so on. Get yourself on their mailing list and keep an eye out for ones you’re interested in, and don’t be afraid to suggest some either: organisers are always keen to hear what their community wants to learn about. Councils are also a great place to learn about what’s happening around you. Check out the sustainability page of your local council’s website to stay abreast of local events and initiatives. They will likely have information on ways to reduce waste and may even have special deals on worm-farms or composting systems for local residents. And lastly, if you’re someone who’s into social media, hop onto Facebook and Instagram to see what permaculture groups are around. Search for ‘Permaculture [region]’, and ‘Buy Nothing [region]’ etc. Once you’re a part of those types of groups, you’ll quickly find out about every other interesting group around you, guaranteed. Get to know your neighbours and the people near where you live. Talk to shop owners, wave at the crossing person, strike up a conversation with people you see out in the park. Maybe bake something to share with your neighbours, or offer to take their bins out for them. It doesn’t have to be anything massive: just making contact is the best way to start building community. Having familiar faces around you does important things for mental health (as lockdowns taught us here in Naarm/Melbourne), and feeling the sense of connection you get when you receive a nod or a smile is the type of People Care that helps you feel grounded and inspired to look after the world immediately around you.  If you have the time and energy, you may like to start up some sort of community group of your own. It could be a sharing stand for books, toys, or produce; it could be a jogging group; or simply an arrangement to meet the same two dog owners each afternoon at the dog park.  Whatever you choose, just start small and keep it up. I like to create community because it makes me feel happy and safe. The connection I feel with the people around me allows me to settle in to my home more deeply, and gives me a sense of purpose, support and contentment. Find out what edible plants are growing around you that could be added to your diet. Look for fruit trees overhanging fences and ‘volunteer’ plants growing along margins (principle : Use edges and value the marginal).  Make friends with locals who have fruit trees and/or herbs growing in their gardens; maybe you can swap some preserves, or baked goods, or offer to do some weeding for them in exchange for some of their produce.  Get to know which weeds and wild plants are edible. This is a great resource to get you started. We’re lucky enough to have an increasing number of excellent foraging guides available for Australian species, so get your thinking gear around some of it (check out the Resources list at the end of this post) and get out there. There’s so much to consider in the discussion around ethical and sustainable eating, that it would fill an entire post in itself, so I’m just going to touch briefly on a few things that I found useful.  In a country as dry as Australia normally is (La Niña has made things a bit different these past two years), water is a hot commodity, so seeing water as a ‘yield’ and working to catch and store it (principle ) is important.  Lots of newer properties have rainwater tanks built into their system, but many older rental properties don’t. Milkwood has been harvesting rainwater in rental properties for over  years, and have condensed their knowledge in this awesome workshop replay for you.  If harvesting rainwater seems a bit beyond your capacity for now though, other things you can do in a rental to save water include: Sorting out issues as and when they arise is something I’ve learnt to do after  years of renting. When you notice a dripping tap, or a dodgy light switch, or there’s a funny sound coming from the oven, let your agent or landlord know about it. By alerting them straight away, it’s more likely that the solution will be a minor one that doesn’t require a large outlay of resources, time or money. Good for the environment, and good for your relationship with the landlord.  Similarly with cleaning, if you keep on top of basic routine cleaning – a quick wipe down, removal of rubbish etc – you’ll show your landlord and housemates that you respect the property which improves your relationship with them; you’ll be creating a living space that’s healthier for you to live in; and you’ll be reducing the need for harsh cleaning products when it inevitably comes to moving day.  A quick trick I like to use in cupboards is to line them – often with wallpaper I picked up cheap at the tip-shop, but sometimes just with saved wrapping paper – before unpacking my belongings into them. This makes the exit-clean super simple, and chemical free: I just need to remove the paper and give the shelves a light dusting and I’m done! Start making your own cleaning products and toiletries. Most things can be kept clean with soap, acids or alkalis – acids include vinegar, citric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Alkalis include bicarb soda, borax and washing soda. And most body products contain an oil of some sort, a butter, a wax, and possibly some fragrance or colour. You can make your own scrap vinegar for use as a general cleaner and hair conditioner. You can also use it in cooking (but not preserving as it’s not acidic enough), and it’s a great way to reduce food waste if your household eats apples. You can also use this scrap vinegar (or regular white vinegar) to make an effective citrus cleaning vinegar.  There’s some argument as to whether homemade laundry detergents are actually harmful to clothes and washing machines, so perhaps take a look into that before mixing up your own blends. Fortunately, there are lots of options around these days to buy eco-friendly cleaning solutions and powders with minimal packaging (more on that later). Deodorant, moisturiser, even soaps are all relatively easy to make yourself with ingredients bought from a bulk-food store. But if that’s not something you’re up to or interested in, do a little light searching and you’ll almost certainly stumble across someone locally who’s making low-waste options for you to buy. Or maybe your local community house would be interested in hosting a workshop with an expert and you could go to that.  However you go about it, the key takeaway here is that there are loads of ways to reduce your impact on the planet when it comes to cleaning and body products. Perhaps just start with one, and see how you go. Learning to preserve food helps you reduce food wastage. This begins with learning how to store fresh food effectively so it doesn’t ‘go off’ quicker than it should. Different methods include using glass jars, containers with good seals on them, damp tea towels, vases of water, or simply placing cut fruit and veg flat on a plate.  If you’re looking to catch and store energy (principle ) in food form for longer periods, you can do so by all sorts of methods. Freezing, dehydrating, jamming, pickling, water-bath canning and fermenting are all ways of preserving food, and most of them are simpler than you think. I like to remind people that humans have been using many of these methods for hundreds of years with no specialty equipment and very little training, so don’t be afraid to just have a go.  I’ve listed a stack of good resources at the end of this article, but I’d also encourage you to check out local learning spaces (community houses, local businesses, etc) for workshops to attend, as there’s been a real revival in these traditional arts of preserving in recent years, and there are loads of people wanting to share that knowledge. Many places are now supporting package-free grocery shopping – ranging from dried goods to oils and nut butters, and sweet treats to cleaning and body products – which is great to see. Bulk food stores allow you to buy what you need, and use your own containers which reduces not only packaging waste, but also food waste, as you’re not forced to buy excess.  Some major supermarkets are now also offering bulk-food shopping options, but for now, they mostly require you to use their (largely plastic) packaging to do so. It’s a step in the right direction though!  If you don’t happen to have a bulk store you can access, there’s still a bit you can do. Looking for products that are concentrated (so you need to buy them less often); come in recycled packaging (that is also recyclable); or are made from recycled products is a great start. Also look for products with fewer ingredients that are known to have less impact on the environment than others (RSPO approved palm oil for example), and that are actively contributing to fair trade, organic and cruelty-free production. As with anything in the commercial world though, watch out for ‘greenwashing’ – just because it’s in brown packaging, doesn’t mean it’s any better for the environment than it used to be. Reducing consumption is part of the much larger conversation around waste, but it doesn’t just mean using less energy or avoiding plastic packaging. Reducing the amount of ‘stuff’ you bring into your living system is something you can do no matter where you live. Think clothing, tools, utensils, furniture, toys, sporting goods, books…. the list goes on. Huge amounts of resources go into the production of Stuff – physical materials, money, energy and time – so buying or using secondhand is an important way of preventing those resources being wasted by keeping Stuff out of the waste stream. It also means there’s less need for new Stuff to be manufactured, thus neatly reducing the future drain on resources as well.  Where to source second-hand Stuff: There’s so much more to share, but hopefully this list helps encourage you to start permaculture living in your rental: it’s totally doable if you start small and build on your successes.

Garlicky, tangy and a bit sour – probiotic pickled mushrooms are so delish! Here’s two easy recipes to make them at home, using the basic biological pickling method of lacto-fermentation, which relies on little more than salt, water and time. These pickled mushrooms make great bruschetta with butter and herbs, or you can serve them as a side dish with just about anything… Btw, this recipe is one of many we share inside our deeply excellent online Home Mushroom Cultivation course. Because, when you cultivate your own mushrooms, you’ll often end up with a bumper harvest. Which creates a wonderful opportunity to try new recipes for preserving your mushrooms, so they last for many months to come. There is a long tradition of pickling mushrooms, which comes to us from cultures in Poland, Russia and Northern Asia – and there are many ways to pickle a mushroom. A classic preservation method for foraged mushrooms was simply layering mushrooms with salt in a barrel. The salt extracts the water in the mushrooms, and creates a sort of self-brining pickle. The recipes below focus on lacto-fermentation – used as a super-easy and nutritious pickling method for classics across the globe, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and dill pickles, to name but a few.  Lacto-ferments require only vegetables (or fungi), salt and filtered water. Don’t be fooled by the name, you don’t need to include lactose or dairy, it’s named after the lactobacillus bacteria, a microscopic, probiotic bacteria that’s great for your gut – and is naturally found hanging out on the surface of most veggies and fungi. Lacto-ferments are a bit magic – and it’s all about the amount of salt we use. Too little salt, and a whole bunch of moulds and bacteria, including the ones we don’t want to eat, will crash the party. Too much salt and we kill everything, including the good guys. If you get the salty brine just right, the harmful bacteria can’t survive, but the gut-friendly lactobacillus thrives. It gets busy eating the sugars in the mushrooms and producing lactic acid – which not only preserves your mushrooms, but it also creates that classic salty-sour flavour that tastes so good. Alrighty, let’s learn how to do it… Now, just like growing mushrooms, fermenting mushrooms will be impacted by the climate where you live. The secret is to keep a close eye on them. You’ll learn after a few goes what works best for your particular climate and home: If you live somewhere very warm, maybe you’re best off putting your jar of pickled mushrooms into the fridge door after a week to slow it down. Or maybe, if your place is cold, it will take longer, and you’ll find your ferments work best on top of the fridge near the back where they can get some of the warmth.  When the pickled mushrooms taste good, tightly seal the jar and place somewhere cool (probably your fridge, unless you happen to have a cool cellar) and eat with gusto. They should last for months – if you can stop yourself from gobbling them all up immediately, that is. So for this recipe, you’re going for a simpler, quicker lacto-ferment – a bit like dill pickles, but with mushrooms. This recipe is highly delicious, and quick – it’s ready in a week. Basically, you’re going to blanch your fresh mushrooms, then pickle them in a % brine for about a week – after which you can eat them, or store in refrigerator for a few weeks.     ;Milkwood
"Last year, Peter Owen unintentionally set himself a challenge: could he furnish his home using discarded flotsam found within his local urban ‘forest’ – the streets and laneways of Sydney? The idea to repair furniture and household items dumped in the streets came as Peter and his wife Claire studied Permaculture Living. The furniture-maker and dad, who was also workshop manager at Sydney’s Bower Reuse and Repair Centre (an amazing community resource, just btw) promptly set up a woodworking shed and started collecting. As he went, Peter posted to Instagram, sharing his experiences as he practiced applying the  permaculture principles to making and fixing found bits and bobs – an excellent way to illustrate that permaculture can be applied to all areas of life, not just gardening. “I got keen to apply permaculture principles to woodworking because that’s where the abundance was. It was incredibly rewarding to be able to just gather all the materials for my own house from my urban forest,” Peter recalls. So – let’s take a look at some of the Instagram posts he created, plus have a chat to Peter about what he learned during this project… Peter created one Instagram post for each of the  permaculture principles – these are our favourites… “Without the first principle of permaculture, I wouldn’t be woodworking. I wouldn’t have observed the bounty all around. An idea for this decade was upon me: I observed the rubbish on the street and the rubbish in our wood bin and I corrected my error. It’s not rubbish, it’s our resource.” “At the Bower we are always catching Sydney’s bits and bobs and storing them for that special day they’ll be needed. I’ve come to realise we are masters of the second permaculture principle. If you know the pleasure of picking your own herbs, that’s our pleasure when repairing and tinkering as we do.” “It’s in the spirit of this third principle that the Bower not only repairs furniture but also teaches students the skills to be their own repairers and maker. Education is a renewable service.” “This principle is my favoritefavourite because this is where my understanding of permaculture, economics and artistry all collide. We design from patterns to detail because permanent cultures cannot prevail under patterns which overextend their value.” “The circular economy has many parts: there is taking something you don’t need and getting it to someone in need; there is taking something broken and repairing it; there is teaching the community to be repairers themselves.” “With this th principle, I’ve really been struggling to absorb the great change Claire and I have brought upon our lives, uprooting from Sydney and moving to Adelaide. But if permaculture has taught me anything, it is that the earth is not dead – it’s living – and who knows what flowers the soil is readying to recreate.” So good! Now, let’s have a bit more of a chat with Pete about all this, shall we? Hello! I’m a furniture-maker and house husband. Father to my son. Self-taught philosopher and wannabe artist (but aren’t we all?). I got into permaculture-thinking a number of years ago and it has hugely influenced the path I’m on – being the reason I got into furniture repurposing. My wife, Claire, has been coming to permaculture too, looking for climate solutions and ways to embed sustainable principles into our daily lives. She signed us up for the Mlkwood Permaculture Living course as something productive and enjoyable that we could do together. Which it turned out to be. I know for Claire and I, we have really walked away from the course with a shared language now. We might decide to go for a bike ride and in choosing where to go, we’ll go to a park where we know there is a rosemary bush and that helps us decide pasta for dinner – and we’ll say to each other knowingly, ‘integrate don’t segregate’. We actually only recently achieved our final Milkwood action – to make climate-positive change – the other week, when Claire and her sister organised a local climate-action play group. It had been a long-time idea we’d wanted to make happen, creating a child-friendly space for parents and caregivers to come together, share our feelings about climate change and talk about things we’re doing to make the world better for our kids. Well, I started in the garden myself. But there was this permaculture idea about zones, where you have your most intensive crops close, like out the kitchen door – that’s zone . Then your less intensive crops in the field – zone  – but then at the edge of the property is the forest which you don’t have to tend at all – zone . Here, you go for walks, clear your mind, and maybe find a fallen log and bring it home for firewood. I lived in Sydney, Darlinghurst, and my zone  ‘forest’ was the laneways of Paddington. My garden wasn’t all that abundant in those early days but I suddenly saw the laneways were really abundant with repurposable hard rubbish. So I set up a woodshed in my laundry and started furnishing our home and making repairs.  I had initially understood that principle as being about harnessing solar energy or rainwater or preserving food. But at The Bower, I was looking at all the furniture and electrical goods, and seeing them as a ‘catch and store’ of labor.  All this industry and all these workers had brought these items into the world. And even if they were no longer repairable or desirable, that didn’t mean there wasn’t an enormous energy potential in them. One thing I love about repurposing is honouring and valuing all the labour already spent in the world. For me, the highlight of my permaculture posts came during the lockdown, when Claire and I decided to build a cubby house for our son in the front yard – the ‘integrate don’t segregate’ permaculture principle. We realised with this principle that Claire and I should do it together. It was about making the garden a fun space for our son so that he plays more harmoniously while we gardened.  Because the cubby and garden were in our front yard, it became a chance to connect with the neighbourhood during an otherwise hard time. So this principle kind of fed on itself once we got into it and integrated us in ways we didn’t expect. Thanks for passing the mic to me! The main thing I want to add is – we are very early on our permaculture journey and I can sometimes get overwhelmed by all the ways we are not living sustainably. But I found Milkwood’s Permacutlure Living approach really reassuring – to focus on one or two actions at a time, and that it’s OK to do ‘small and slow solutions’.  We wrote up our goal statement and our commitments for each principle and them stuck on our kitchen cupboards. It was very satisfying to tick things off, such as reinstating our worm farm or trying our hand at pickling.  One of the most reassuring thing is that, once you’ve put an action in place, it becomes part of your normal and you forget it’s there. It becomes part of your baseline and it’s only upon reflection that you realise you’ve got better. On the personal front, Claire and I are realising how much we need to just stop, observe and interact and get a feel for Kaurna land. And that’s going to take time. As a furniture-maker, I’ve decided to heed the ‘small and slow solutions’ principle and start over by just making lamps for a while as a small business. With my first batch of lamps, I used small off-cuts from my sister-in-law’s dressmaking side hustle to make the lampshades. If my inputs can be from other maker’s outputs then those are the kind of bonds that’ll make for a vibrant society.  I’ve also been fortunate to get a studio space at The Mill, an Adelaide artist co-working space. By moving back, we’ve realised that reconnecting with our families and community networks makes climate-positive changes so much easier. We don’t have to try to do or be all things – we can use the skills and strengths of those around us to build ourselves up – ‘integrate not segregate’.

So – you’ve heard of permaculture, but aren’t quite sure what it all means or where to begin? We’ll get you started, with this free guide that outlines seven excellent but super-simple ways to start practising permaculture at your place – wherever in the world you live, and whether you have a backyard veggie patch, a windowbox in your apartment, or even no garden at all. Because permaculture isn’t actually about gardening, as some people think. It’s also about your relationship with your ecosystem, your food system, your home, your family, your community and your society. It’s about finding ways, both big and small, to design a better life for both yourself and for everyone around you, taking nature as your guide. And – YOUR permaculture life can look… however YOU want it to. All seven actions in our Getting Started With Permaculture guide are based around local, home-based skills that you’ll be able to start right now, today – but they’re revolutionary acts also. Because, to change this world of ours for the better, we all need to gather ourselves first, and then work out from there. Committing to doing what you can, within your own particular context and home space, is an excellent way to get started with permaculture – and with climate-positive skills. Little by little, you’ll be designing a life packed with climate-positive action (which, ahem, is exactly what our planet and communities need right now) – while also creating a life that gives back, makes a difference, AND feels good while you make it happen, too. Pretty soon you’ll be noticing just how much positive change you can bring to your daily life and the lives of people around you by adopting new, sometimes TINY (but is anything ever tiny, really? It all connects…) habits, new skills, and climate-positive practices – which add up, piece by piece, to make life worth living. That’s permaculture living in a nutshell – the process of learning to make change and set things up so that you can live well, and also maximise what you give back – to your family, your community and your ecosystem. This in turn means extra goodness, energy, food or support for those who need it, and the minimisation of any negative impact you have on this planet. Sounds good, yes? Ready to get started? It bears repeating here – permaculture ethics, principles and skills are all, directly or indirectly, based on the wisdom and knowledge of traditional peoples, the world over. This is not ‘new’ information. The point of permaculture, as we see it, is to respectfully use these fundamentally excellent ideas + strategies in our everyday lives – in a way that works for you, your household and your ecosystem, to make life better – while actively practicing gratitude to the knowledge-keepers before us, to whom we owe pretty much everything. So – you can use permaculture as a lens for daily decision-making AND for big-picture thinking. By the way, all of the climate-positive actions outlined in our free Getting Started With Permaculture Living guide are sneak-peek lessons from inside our excellent (so say our students) Permaculture Living online course. If you decide to dive deeper into your permaculture living journey and join us for this -week course, you’ll learn + skills and habits, including: In a nutshell, you’ll learn how to use permaculture thinking, design, skills and habits to transform your everyday for the better.

Over the years, we’ve lived in a few off-grid houses in cold climates. And in these houses, we relied on wood energy to warm our house, cook our food AND heat our hot water – on many a cold and rainy day. Each time, our woodstove was at the core of our kitchen. I loved its gentle radiant heat, like a slow happiness that got into everyone’s bones, even as we slept. And I loved that, even if all else failed – say, a huge storm came along and the world outside became dark and lost – I could still cook my family and crew a big, hot, nourishing dinner. And pudding as well. But that was then. These days we live just above a village in a valley, in southern lutruwita / Tasmania. A place where the topography causes cool air to fall and pool, and smoke from the many wood-burning fireplaces (and from State Government-approved forestry burns too) settles in a hazy layer around the homes and families and children of the valley – folks who can’t help but breathe it all in. Multiple studies are now pointing to a host of not-great health impacts from exposure to that smoke and associated pollution. Some cities in the US and Canda have actually banned new wood-burning fireplaces because they contribute to air pollution – and some councils in Australia are considering the same. Just last year, Asthma Australia called for a national phase-out of wood heaters, citing their negative impact on human health. Well, the answer isn’t necessarily crystal cut. Fireplaces and woodstoves can have good elements and not-so-good. It’s a tricky conundrum for those of us aiming to live a permaculture life. On the one hand, ‘Fair Share’ and ‘People Care’ stand as two core ethics, so we must consider the impact of our actions and choices on other people. On the other, we aim to ‘use and value renewable resources’. And some wood – especially things like stickwood, coppice, and well-managed woodlots – can easily fall into this category. There’s plenty of firewood that does not fit into the ‘renewable resource’ category however, depending on where/how you’re sourcing your firewood. We’ll leave that point with you. But, resilience… Yes, it’s true that when/if the power goes out, being able to heat your water, cook food and stay warm is a Darn Good Idea. And a decent woodstove can do all those things beautifully. But what about the rest of the time? Do we need to put our own household’s resilience before the ongoing health of our communities? Shouldn’t we instead be challenging and changing the larger energy systems we ALL rely on, to focus on community solar and mini-grids, so that everyone has access to renewable, stable and resilient power to cook and to stay warm?  Really, like so many elements of permaculture living, the decision on whether to burn wood to heat your home will come down to your personal (and community) context. So – let’s take a look at the pros and cons of becoming a wood-burning household, as well as some good things to think about when deciding whether to warm your home with fire. Open fireplaces, the kind that were really common in houses a century ago, are best avoided altogether. They burn inefficiently and so give off the most pollution – both in your home, and into your ecosystem – and a lot of the heat is lost up your chimney anyway. Then there’s combustion fireplaces, and wood-burning stoves. These tend to be more efficient than open fireplaces, as they operate in a closed-box environment. You can better control the amount of air going in, meaning you can manage the fire so it burns somewhat more efficiently. Lots of different models exist – in the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has an EPA Certified Wood Heater Database, where you can compare models according to their efficiency and emissions rates. Wood pellet stoves are growing in popularity as a more environmentally friendly heating option. They’re fuelled by specially formulated tiny logs made from waste sawdust and other wood byproducts, which are designed to burn very efficiently – although you need to consider how those pellets are being made, and the embodied energy within. You’re also reliant apon a pellet supplier, and can’t easily make your own, without the right gear.  If you already have a wood heater installed, or are thinking about getting one, researching its burning efficiency and likely emissions is an essential first step. OK, so I alluded to some of the health issues associated with smoke from indoor fireplaces before – let’s take a closer look at that. According to New South Wales Health: “Smoke from wood-burning heaters is a complex mixture of particles and gases and contributes significantly to air pollution. The main air pollutants in wood smoke are particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and a range of other organic compounds like formaldehyde, benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. “Smoke from wood-burning heaters can affect your health. Long-term exposure can cause heart and lung disease, while brief exposures can aggravate asthma or worsen pre-existing heart conditions.” This especially impacts children, older folks and people with heart or lung conditions, such as angina, asthma or emphysema. But, really, air pollution affects us all. It can even cause premature death. In cities like Launceston, in lutruwita Tasmania – which sits in a big valley – the collective smog from woodfires was causing so many community health problems that the council initiated a city-wide buyback scheme, to remove wood-burning stoves from homes, in an attempt to improve health outcomes. Canberra in the ACT has tried a similar thing.  It’s true that this technique is a bit clunky, because not all woodstoves emit the same amount of pollution… but it’s also true that our individual actions can have big effects on our community’s health – which is something we all need to consider. And fireplaces don’t just affect the air outside. One study found that opening a wood burner door to refuel your fire releases harmful pollution particles inside your home, which can take an hour or two to dissipate. So – perhaps all this causes you to firmly scratch a fireplace off your home heating list? If so, consider how you will source alternative heating, and where that energy will come from. Because as we all know, burning fossil fuels contributes hugely to climate-altering pollution and catastrophic climate change… which is already impacting the health of people and planet – starting with those who are the least privileged, and who have the least power to stop it. So finding a sustainable alternative to coal-fired electricity and gas – if this is where the energy will come from to heat your home – should be a priority for all of us who can afford to do so. What better energy options are available in your area? Can you source greener power? Do you have the resources to install solar panels? Is there wind power or hydroelectricity in your area?  And if not, what models and strategies could you initiate or get involved with, to lobby your energy provider for greener power, OR how can you help organise to change the energy options where you live? Hepburn ZNet is one inspiring example of community-powered energy. And there’s plenty more. Wood is a renewable resource, in that it grows back – unlike gas and coal-fired electricity, which many of us rely on for heating and cooking. Depending on where you live, wood can also be sustainably produced and sourced locally, unlike its fossil fuel alternatives. So, a home woodstove or fire offers a level of energy independence and low-tech resilience that’s hard to go past, for some. A wood burner can also serve more functions beyond heating. Your fire might also: Here are a few other benefits of indoor fireplaces: A note on good wood: If you decide a fire does have a place in your home system, this is a useful article to read on the importance of using properly cured wood (air dried for  to  months) and the best way to load up your wood burner before bed, without causing excessive smoke through the night.  So, with all this in mind – what are we now doing here at our place in lutruwita Tasmania? When we bought our house, it was heated by a single heat pump (reverse-cycle aircon) and an old slow combustion fireplace. We were keen to switch the old woodheater for an efficient woodstove, but as we learned more about the affects of woodsmoke on community health in valleys like ours… we had to sit down and have a good think. Where did heating meet resilience meet best community outcomes, for us? The first thing we did was install a Heat Transfer Kit – this is a great, cheap and low-energy way to efficiently move hot air from a warm room (or from the roof cavity, when the sun is shining) to other colder rooms, and cycle it around. With this system, we could rely on just one heat source to heat the whole house, with minimal energy used. The Heat Pump in the main space is electric, and % of the electricity in lutruwita Tasmania comes from Hydropower – which is about as ‘green’ as electricity gets. So clearly the lowest-impact way to heat our place was going to be with this unromantic but efficient device. But what about when the power goes out? As it does when the weather is wild down this way, and who knows what the future holds in that regard. Relying JUST on grid electricity didn’t seem smart, now that we were finally not renting, and could make our own call on this. Rooftop solar and batteries is something we’d love to install when we can, but long story short our roof needs replacing first, which is super exxy, and we need to do that before putting solar panels on and getting batteries (also exxy). So that’s all on the ‘one day’ list, at the moment.  So in the meantime, we installed an efficient wood heater to use occasionally – in times of power-outage, and on winter Sundays, when we’re all home, all day. It’s a Australian-made Thermalux – a wood heater, which is also a stovetop, and an oven, and which has a water jacket that we added on, to heat our hot water when the stove is fired up.  This way, if the power is out, we can still heat our home, make soup for the whole street and bake bread as well – plus heat water for whoever needs a wash. And on some winter Sundays, we fire it up – to heat the house, provide endless cups of tea, dry all the socks, and cook lunch and also amazing pizzas, all at once. We make the most of that energy, if we’re choosing to use it, and stack as many functions on top that we can. The hot water system gets a massive boost also, and cosy fireside times are had by one and all.  As mentioned above, this occasional use only works well if we’re using dry, well-cured and sustainably sourced wood. We’re lucky to have a local sawmill that sells packs of seasoned off-cuts from their milling process, and that’s the best source we’ve come up with so far. So – minimal impact of community – tick. Also resilience – tick. Plus happy humans. And that’s what we’ve settled on at the moment – given our situation, available funds, and our need to be warm. This might not be the right answer for you – everyone’s context is different – but it’s what is currently working for us. Rocket Stoves are hyper energy efficient, can be built by almost anyone out of ‘rubbish’ (an old tin can, basically) and result in more usable heat than any other wood-burning system we’ve come across. Some are for cooking, some for heating. All rely on maximum effect for minimum input. The big difference, compared to fireplaces, is that rocket stoves (and other technologies like them) allow close to complete combustion. So, rather than emitting smoke, soot or creosote out a chimney, all those compounds are instead sucked into the stove’s insulated burn tunnel and combusted – releasing even more heat. You can actually hear the air roaring through the system, supercharging the fire as it goes. You don’t need much wood to run a well-made rocket stove – and it will give off very little smoke. Which is also a sign of energy efficiency, and a reduction in pollution. If you’re interested in exploring this idea, here are the basic steps to make your own pocket rocket stove, perfect for cooking dinner. Perhaps one day the Rocket Stove will be available in home fireplace form? If you do go the fireplace route, one thing is clear – burning wood sparingly is always a good choice. Wherever you can, choose other options first – put on a jumper, grab a blanket, open up the blinds on equator-facing windows (north in the Southern Hemisphere, south in the Northern Hemisphere) during the day, do some star jumps even! And, if you can and are able, improve the passive heating capabilities of your house – you might add a heat-catching glasshouse on the equator side of the house, improve your insulation to prevent heat escaping, or get thick and cosy curtains and blinds for your windows. Follow the ‘passive house, active human’ ethos, if you can. Really, all of these simple actions are beneficial, regardless of the type of heating system you choose. Because, whether you’re burning wood or flicking a switch, it all relies on precious resources. The more we wind back our consumption and lower our impact, the better for our planet, our household, and our community. So – which way would you go, and what works best in your own home and context?

Growing mushrooms on logs is something we’d LOVE to see in many more backyards – for all the good reasons. Growing mushrooms on logs will increase your household resilience – plus add amazing flavour, nutrition AND medicine to your home-grown diet. And you don’t need a single garden bed to get started. Though if you DO already have a veggie patch, growing mushrooms on logs somewhere at the edge of that will only add to your garden’s diversity (and flavour). And the best bit – once you understand the basics, growing mushrooms on logs is very straightforward. To start with, let’s take a look at what makes growing mushrooms on logs so excellent, what species are best suited to this approach, and what life as a home shiitake cultivator will look like for you. Are you ready to get your shiitake on? Log culture is a fantastic example of the permaculture principle “using the edges and valuing the marginal”. If you look at farmland, or indeed at your backyard, you’ll often notice small patches of trees (downsize that to a few shrubs at backyard scale) on the steep or tricky-to-access land at the edges of the landscape. But you know what? That shady, protected understory of the forest, or the shrubby nooks in your garden, or that ‘twilight zone’ bit down the side, that gets no sun and only grows moss and weeds – is not only providing biodiversity to the ecosystem around it, it’s also often PERFECT for mushroom log cultivation. Which means we can all create more resilience in our backyards or properties by adding mushroom logs to the mix – utilising unused space, producing delicious and medicinal mushrooms – AND coexisting with the biodiversity of the scraps of forest, or our backyard’s shrubby patches… so everyone in your ecosystem wins. More mushroom logs, please. Sound shroomy good? Let’s get started – firstly, here’s an introduction to mushroom log cultivation, taken from a lesson inside our -week Home Mushroom Cultivation online course… … so that’s a basic overview. Let’s recap a few of the central points – So, what species can we grow on logs? Well, a log is a piece of dead wood (no way!), so most of the recently-dead-wood-loving saprotrophic mushrooms can be grown on logs. Common edible species grown on logs include:  And our favourite, the main species that is commercially cultivated on logs, the shiitake!  Shiitake is the species we focus on in our free Mushroom Cultivation Guide and in our Grow Mushrooms on Logs short course (which is included as part of our fully mentored and guided  week Home Mushroom Cultivation online course) – because it’s delicious, nutritious, medicinal AND (possibly most importantly) it’s super easy to grow on logs. So shiitake is THE beginner mushroom we recommend for log cultivation. But wait – there’s more good news – while some elements, like preferred type of tree, or ideal fruiting temperatures, might differ between species – the same basic log cultivation technique we’re talking about here applies to ALL the wood-loving mushrooms listed above. It’s worth clarifying that when we say ‘wood-loving mushrooms’, we mean saprotrophic mushrooms, which are the ‘primary decomposers’ – these are the species who love to eat WOOD specifically, in it’s purest, woodiest form – ie: a dead branch, or a stump. Separate to these mushrooms are the beloved and super-useful ‘secondary decomposers’ – the mushrooms who like to eat organic matter that is already well broken down. These are the ‘compost-loving’ mushrooms such as King Stropharia, Wood Blewits, Agaricus (the button mushrooms) and Shaggy Manes. These types of mushrooms will NOT grow on logs – they’re much more suited to mushroom gardens – which you can learn how to create here. As a home-cultivator, growing shiitake on logs presents a particularly special opportunity to weave mushroom growing into your garden, your kitchen and your community. So what could this look like for you? Cultivating shiitake on logs is all about playing the long-game.  Shiitake logs are typically inoculated in autumn (or spring) and left to myceliate for two summers. Which means it can take up to  months or even  years till you harvest your first mushrooms. But, once it starts fruiting, a log can keep producing more mushrooms each year for up to  years.  So – because this is NOT going to get you a quick mushroom fix (unlike growing oyster mushrooms in a bucket, here’s an overview of that technique)… it’s worth thinking through a bit of a game plan for your log cultivation project. Here are the basic steps… With outdoor grows, it makes good sense to future-proof your harvest by inoculating a batch of logs each year – this way, you’ll move into a cycle of both cultivating and harvesting year in, year out – with very little effort, once you know what you’re doing. For a home-cultivator,  logs is a good amount to aim for, accrued over  years. This will give you a few kilograms of delicious shiitake mushrooms each week over mushroom season, which is perfect if you want to cook some straight away, and dry enough for the rest of the year. When it comes to inoculating, the most cost-effective way to buy spawn is in big bags (supplier suggestions below), which will give you enough spawn to inoculate at least  logs. Keep in mind though – if you inoculate  logs each autumn, you could find yourself wrangling  logs in  years time – which is doable, but it IS is a lot of work, and also a lot of mushrooms.  So, given that this is all going to take you a bit of time, effort and space, consider making this a thing you do with friends. Shiitake logs are best done with a crew, on all the levels. This way, you’ll find that there’s a sweet spot in terms of logs, work required, and the sheer volume of mushrooms you could be harvesting. Cutting logs is faster and safer with a bit of help. And inoculating is faster and way more fun with a friend.  And, over time, when the logs are ready to fruit, you can then make a real event of it, if you like – because the best time to inoculate your logs is autumn… which happens to also be the best time for the mushrooms to fruit, and therefore is MUSHROOM FEAST season. So some day soon, you could host an Annual Autumn Shiitake Festival, with friends inoculating, cooking, eating and enjoying shiitake goodness. Just an idea. Want more info? Here’s our Beginner’s guide to Home Mushroom Cultivation free e-book for you: And, as we mentioned, the video above is a lesson from our complete beginner’s online course on Home Mushroom Cultivation – which is teaching folks all over the WORLD how to successfully grow stacks of gourmet and medicinal mushrooms at home, using low-waste and organic techniques – on cardboard, in buckets, on logs AND in gardens.

Each year, Laurie Green’s family saves about $, on groceries – by being part of a network of gardeners who regularly exchange their homegrown fruit and vegetables, all for free. Rewind to , and Laurie was facing a high cost of living and a bare backyard. As she started to grow food and connect with other gardeners in her street, she decided to go one step further. And so Laurie founded Crop Swap Australia – which has now grown to a network of over , swappers. Go, Laurie! These days, Laurie grows as much as she can in her own suburban permaculture garden while running a small co-op and working in permaculture design and consultancy. She’s also a founding member of the Sydney Edible Garden Trail. We’ve actually known Laurie for a good decade – she studied permaculture with us back in  and collaborated on a workshop and food swap at our  Rooftop Garden project. And last year, a friend gifted her a spot on our Milkwood Permaculture Living course. So great to see our alumni learning and growing, and stewarding a heap of ace community-building projects. Alrighty, let’s sit down with Laurie and learn all there is to know about crop swapping, so you have the tools to get started in your own community… There are two ways in which people can participate. The first way is online. People can swap by joining their local Crop Swap Facebook group (find yours at www.CropSwap.Sydney) and then post a photo of what they have to offer, plus details of what they’d like in return (if anything) and the pick-up suburb. Within minutes the offers should start rolling in and collection can then be arranged offline. The second way is by face-to-face events, which really are what Crop Swap is all about. Often held in community gardens, schools or inspiring public spaces, these meets allow people to connect with the origins of their food and are about far more than just an exchange. People swap recipes and growing tips, and really get to know each other. People come from all different backgrounds, from young families to those swapping to save money or to meet like-minded individuals. Some people do it to benefit their health. I never anticipated how the idea would be embraced! There are almost  groups under the Crop Swap Australia banner, with many more unofficial ones being established all the time. There is also one in Vancouver, Canada. These communities make up a network of over , swappers, with countless exchanges taking place every day. Each group operates slightly differently but, due to the high number of attendees at our Sydney events, this is how we run things: Absolutely. Baked goods, seeds, gardening goods or relevant books are often swapped. You can even share skills, such as knife sharpening or mending, in exchange for what’s being offered. A lot of the time swappers are just happy for their excesses not to be wasted, so will gratefully send them off to a good home with the promise of a future swap, or even without anything in return at all. I was once given a spoon carving lesson in return for cuttings from my garden! From connecting with your local community and reducing waste to gaining access to nutritious food at a lesser cost, knowing the origins of what you’re eating and reducing food miles – there are so many benefits to swapping. Eating locally is better for our planet and reduces the need to rely on the inefficiencies and unpredictability of large supply chains. In , I calculated that we saved approximately $, a year by crop swapping just a few times a week.  Crop Swap has honestly changed our lives in ways that I would never have expected. It has connected us with a grassroots community and given us experiences that we would otherwise not have had. Because of Crop Swap, my garden has been planted using locally acclimatised seeds and plants, many of which are varieties that can’t be readily purchased. Most of all I reflect on the lessons in patience that it has brought us in what is often a fast-paced world. Patience to sow the seeds, rear their seedlings, plant them out and then harvest their bounty so these crops can then be transformed into something else that we need. For a long time, the kids honestly thought our garden was magic because of this process – I still do! Just that – someone very dear to me gifted me the Permaculture Living course last year, knowing the value of giving experiences rather than things. It was so appreciated and I loved the real world, practical modules that I could complete at my own pace. Although I have already completed my Permaculture Design Certificate, this was a fabulous, well-paced and structured course that celebrates permaculture in many forms. Thanks for sharing your knowledge and for helping me to move forward on my sustainable living journey. So good! Big thanks to Laurie for sharing her story and tips.

Learning how to compost at home is so good for your garden, your soil, the veggies you’ll grow – and the health of our planet. And you can set up a compost system in almost any situation, whether you have a big backyard, a balcony garden or even just a few pot plants. But getting started can seem a bit daunting. So let’s demystify the whole situation – and we’ll have you creating great home compost in no time. First up – let’s answer a simple question: what is compost? Well, compost is a process of actively feeding a huge number of microorganisms the right stuff in the right amounts, so that they munch and breed and munch some more, converting your pile of food scraps, paper, gardening prunings, manure, autumn leaves and whatever else into a nutrient-rich humus that we all know as ‘compost’. Added back onto your veggie beds, compost improves your soil and thus everything you try to grow. And all from ‘waste’ resources freely available to you. So good! So, let’s dive into the good dirt on composting – we’ll cover which bin is the best, what goes into your compost and what to avoid, troubleshooting tips for when things go a bit pear-shaped (we’ve all been there), and heaps more…  Food waste is a really big problem worldwide. It starts where the food is grown, where up to % of all vegetables produced don’t leave the farm. Once the food gets to us, far too much is simply thrown away. In Australian households, we throw away about . million tonnes of edible food every singly year. That’s a lot. And, sadly, too much of that binned food goes straight to landfill – where it rots and becomes anaerobic. At this point, the organic material is turned into the greenhouse gases methane and carbon dioxide (see illustration above) – and, unfortunately, methane is  times more harmful to our atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Food waste also causes issues with odour, leaching, attracting vermin, and is a potential source for disease. This is where we composters can make a big positive impact. Compost = healthy soil, healthy food, healthy humans, less food waste – and it assists with carbon sequestration, too. How does composting lock up carbon in the soil? Well, firstly, compost creates humus which consists of long chains of carbon atoms that last a long time in the soil. Secondly, when compost is added to soil, the soil becomes healthier with improved structure and increased biological activity. Therefore, the plants growing in it become healthier too and their capacity to photosynthesise is increased, meaning they’re capturing and sequestering more carbon from the air and storing it in the soil. And then we get to eat the healthy food from the healthy soil, and with the food scraps, we can make even more compost. Hooray. What an amazing closed-loop system! OK, so we’ve convinced you to become a composter, yeah? Before we help you decide which compost bin is right for your system, let’s first take a look at what can go inside your bin. Because there are all sorts of systems, techniques and recipes to make amazing compost, but all have four ingredients in common: So, you really only need to understand two key things: which carbon and nitrogen materials are safe to put in your home compost, and then how to mix them up at an appropriate ratio to keep all those compost microorganisms happy and munching away at your pile. Just about all food scraps can be used as a valuable source of nitrogen for your compost bin, tumbler or bokashi bin, but there are a few things to avoid. Let’s break it down. Top tip: Make sure you chop up food waste so it’s the size of a -cent coin to accelerate the composting process. There is a large range of dry carbon materials you can source for your compost system. These include: Top tip: Have a weatherproof bin storing dry carbon materials directly next to your compost bin. This will make it nice and easy for you to add a carbon layer each time you add your food scraps. There are a few things that should not go into your small compost bin, tumbler or bokashi bin. Avoid these things: OK, so now you understand the difference between nitrogen (‘green’) ingredients and carbon (‘brown’) ingredients. So – most compost systems (except worm farms) require a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about : or :. This means it’s good to get to know how carbon-y or nitrogen-y different compostable materials are, then you’ll know how much of each thing to throw in your compost bin to create a thriving environment. Below is a table that shows things like fish guts and chicken poo are really high in nitrogen, while things like cardboard and sawdust are really high in carbon. You’ll need somewhere specific to build your compost pile and store your food waste and other organic materials while they’re composting. So let’s look at three types of compost bins that are great for different reasons in different contexts – the black bin, the tumbler and the Bokashi bin. Black bins that sit directly atop the soil are popular in backyards of all sizes – because they are super easy to use. They are a cold compost (mesophilic) system, because they are smaller than one cubic metre. (Bigger compost piles get super hot, but that’s a whole other story we’ll cover another day.) Because you’re adding materials gradually, things will compost at different rates, meaning you’ll have mature compost at the bottom while you still have fresh food scraps at the very top. For this reason, you need to have at least two compost bins so you can rotate between them, letting one rest (and mature) while you use the other. Turn your compost bin using a ‘compost screw’ or a garden folk – this accelerates the composting process. Start turning the bin’s contents once it’s filled and has rested for a few weeks, then you can give it a turn about once a week until it’s full composted and ready to use. If rodents are coming into your compost bin from under the earth, add a layer of ‘vermin mesh’ directly to the bottom to stop them from being able to dig under. You can buy vermin mesh from most hardware stores. Alternatively, keep your compost bin on a free-draining, hard surface such as some bricks to reduce the likelihood of rodents getting in. Make sure any liquid drains to some nearby earth.  Compost tumblers are a great option for people with limited space, rodent issues or those looking for an ergonomic option that limits bending and lifting. To make sure they work well, here are some basic tips to follow. Bokashi is Japanese for ‘fermented organic matter’ – these small bins are designed to be used in your kitchen, literally atop your bench, if you want. The system includes a purpose-made bucket with a lid and drainage tap. They vary in size and can be up to  litres in volume. The kit also comes with a dry bran mixture (made from rice husks and wheat) that has been inoculated with effective microorganisms. The microorganisms ferment the food scraps, eliminating any bad smells, and are a biologically active living material that can then be transferred to your garden to finish composting in the ground, where it improves soil health. Help! My compost is… Breeding maggots: Remove any meat or excess food. Add a sprinkle of lime and cover with a layer of carbon such as a hessian or wool blanket. Really smelly: It’s too wet and likely to be anaerobic (not enough air). Mix in more carbon materials, turn and add a touch of lime which will help bring it back into balance. Alternatively, you may have overloaded your compost system with too much food waste. Remove some and start a second compost system to cater for the amount of food waste you’re producing. Infested with ants: Your compost system is probably too dry or has exposed food. Add water if dry and cover any exposed food scraps on top of the system with carbon and hessian/felt. You can also turn the compost if in a compost bin. Taking ages to break down: You may need some more nitrogen and/or water to get the party started. Add more nitrogen (food scraps, some manures, green lawn clippings) and water. Empty your compost bin into a pile and rebuild it to get a good balance of carbon and nitrogen throughout. Swamped with small black “vinegar” flies: Some Drosophila flies (also known as vinegar flies) aren’t a bad thing – however, a lot can become annoying. Make sure you have no exposed food scraps by covering the top of the compost with a layer of carbon such as a piece of hessian or wool blanket. You can also place a small jar of vinegar in the top corner of the bin, this will attract and drown excess flies. Home to rats and mice: Reduce the amount of food you’re putting into the system (especially bread and meat). If you have a small compost bin, add vermin mesh on the bottom of the compost bin to prevent rodents from digging under. You can also dig your bin cm into the earth or place it on a free-draining hard surface (bricks or concrete). Make sure any liquid leaving the system is draining into the nearby earth. If rodents are really bad, consider building a worm farm made from a recycled bath as rodents can’t chew through baths with hardwood timber lids. My compost tumbler has become gross and stinky: It’s likely to not be draining well due to its limited air and drainage holes. With a power drill, drill hundreds of holes around its full circumference, mm in size. This will drastically increase the airflow through the system and allow excess moisture to drain freely. My compost tumbler is too heavy to turn: Only fill your tumbler up half to three-quarters of its capacity to ensure you can still turn it easily. Once you become a composter, you’re essentially a food waste hero – diverting all that fertiliser gold from landfill back into the soil, to make more food. Go, you! It’s a great idea to also take a couple of steps back and think about how you can create less food waste in the first place – this will also save you money too.

So, thinking about growing your own mushrooms? Great! There are many ways to grow delicious mushrooms at home – AND, despite what you might have heard, you can do it all without single-use plastic! Why is this important? Well first, there’s the waste of single-use plastic, which is industry-standard for commercial mushroom growing – and we’re all down with the huuuge consequences of these plastics on our ecosystems and communities. Secondly, there’s the resilience factor – keen to create, build and grow food and nutrition systems at your home, that don’t rely on single-use inputs? Mushrooms are a perfect addition to your home food system – but only if you set up a reliable, reusable cultivation system – and for this you’re going to want to use reusable gear and inputs, not single-use stuff. So – if you love mushrooms, but hate waste and are looking for resilience at home, may we introduce you to our reusable, ethical, organic mushroom cultivation techniques – designed specifically for successful, cheap and easy home mushroom cultivation. With all this in mind, we thought we’d share a lesson from our Home Mushroom Cultivation course – which focuses specifically on Why we cultivate the way we do. …to walk you through how it’s possible to cultivate mushrooms from scratch without single-use plastics and not-great chemical inputs, and also WHY we encourage you to do this – for your health, the health of your ecosystem, and to create a resilient food growing system that is perfect for growing gourmet AND medicinal mushrooms, right in your own backyard. So – this is a video lesson from inside our most excellent -week Home Mushroom Cultivation online course – usually only our students get to see these video lessons, but here’s a peek inside… This lesson introduces the underlying ethos behind the Milkwood approach to mushroom cultivation: an approach that intentionally moves away from the “industry standard” practices that are high-waste and require expensive facilities that are not accessible to the home grower. You will learn: The big issue with modern industrial mushroom cultivation is the waste and pollution factor.  Single-use, disposable plastic bags are super common at all stages of commercial mushroom cultivation. It’s very rare to find a commercial cultivator who reuses containers, especially in high-income countries.  Why is this? It really only comes down to the effort and cost involved in keeping things sufficiently clean. Labour is far more expensive than disposable plastic, so, unfortunately, the convenience of disposable plastic has won out over using reusable containers, despite the long term health of our planet and communities losing out as a result. Thankfully, if you choose to grow your own mushies at home, you can sidestep all this. Another not-so-great factor when relying on store-bought mushrooms – commercial mushroom cultivators generally use sterilisation.  These kinds of labs are expensive to set up and often use toxic chemicals, expensive air filtration systems and labour-intensive practices to keep them very very clean.  If you read a lot of the literature about small scale mushroom cultivation, you’ll get the idea that you have to create these environments. But actually, you can grow mushrooms at home without needing a lab – using techniques that don’t require any sterilisation to succeed. Here at Milkwood, we’ve spent a good + years honing our home cultivation processes down to be as solid and ethical as possible. The way we teach is: And we have more information about our -week online Home Mushroom Cultivation course here – a great way to learn how to grow oyster mushrooms without plastic bags.

Simon Toohey is a household name to certain food-loving Australians – for the past few years, the celebrity chef has graced our televisions championing plant-based recipes and sustainability in food. Yay, Simon! And now the former MasterChef finalist is delving into permaculture, bringing the movement’s ethics and principles in from the garden to kitchens and restaurants. Simon, who happens to be a student of our Permaculture Living course, reckons it’s time for chefs to adopt closed-loop cooking (embracing permaculture principle six: produce no waste), while helping educate home cooks on how to use all edible bits of a plant. He’s even created a useful YouTube cooking series on how to ‘use the whole thing’. Let’s sit down for a chat with Simon about how he’s applying permaculture in the cheffing kitchen – and in his small inner-city sharehouse, too… Yes! I have recently – well, probably not so recently now – been on MasterChef seasons  and , trying to cook up a storm in the most stressful environment ever. This amazing show has built a beautiful platform for me to pursue my love of food and sustainability in food. I launched Sustainable Earth Network a couple of years ago and we have a season on sustainable farming and products, which brings the great work of farmers, producers and product producers to the screen, along with local backyard gardeners, community gardens and foragers. I also have a show on Channel  called Freshly Picked, which is Australia’s first fully plant-based show. I’d been doing a bit of learning and gardening work up in Seymore (in Victoria, Australia) with an amazing man called Brian. He is an absolute guru when it comes to growing, soil, compost and bees, and I learned so much from him. I’ve been wanting to learn more about permaculture ever since. At the time I was filming two different shows about plants and it seemed almost wrong to not know enough about permaculture and yet talk about the beauty of plants. I knew all about Milkwood and so when I saw the course on Insta, I jumped on it straight away, as I knew the quality, history and brilliance of this course. It came at the perfect time. Understanding the  permaculture principles has been huge – just saying them out loud to myself helped me draw on that principle’s information and apply it in a practical way. There is an aspect of every principle that I have applied since doing the Milkwood Permaculture Living course. The ones I am loving the most are identifying new plants, learning about natives and why they survive so well, learning about my soil along with saving water (catching and storing) and becoming a better composter. Next it is going to be growing my own mushrooms and probably having a little seed bank out the front of my house – I’m obsessed with saving seeds at the moment. Also just knowing that leading a strong permaculture life is very doable even when living in a very small sharehouse with four people, a tiny backyard and a giant dog… I think there’s a lot of crossovers between permaculture and the hospitality and cheffing worlds. If a chef doesn’t believe this applies to them, then they have not understood where food comes from. What I really loved about the Permaculture Living course was that it talked about closing the loop. In the chef world, it’s the same – from sourcing quality, organic produce to making sure we are looking after the soil. To not wasting anything in the kitchen and making sure we are saving greywater, plus composting scraps and returning them back to the soil. Permaculture principles apply to cheffing as much as the gardener – along with the consumer and everywhere in between. By the way – if you want to check out a few places that do this closed-loop system really well, have a look at Silo Restaurant London and Future Food System in Naarm Melbourne. They are going to the extreme with a zero-waste mentality. It’s excellent. Just a massive thank you so much for opening my eyes to the amazing world of permaculture. It means a lot to me. So, thank you.

Learning how to grow edible and medicinal mushrooms in your home garden is a great way to increase your household’s resilience, enhance your garden’s soil – and make your tummy very happy, all at once. And it’s safe, easy and even potentially free, once you have the basic bits you need. The best bit about mushroom gardens? You don’t need any fancy equipment or ingredients at all – you can get started with a few foraged mushrooms (ID-ed correctly, of course) and some cardboard… and then slowly grow from there, up to an abundant garden of mushroomy goodness. Below, there’s the recording of a live mini-workshop we just did to show you how. This technique is a snippet from inside our online Home Mushroom Cultivation course… which is open for bookings this week! The full rundown of the course is here… Mushroom gardens are a much-loved part of our backyard growing system – they’re easy to get going, support our garden ecosystem as they grow, and then, with very little fuss, pop up as regular harvests of tasty mushrooms for our breakfast. And you don’t even need a garden to grow mushrooms like this – a tub on your balcony or back step can work well for this DIY growing technique, too. Over the years, we’ve learned all about the ins and outs of successful mushroom garden cultivation – and we’d love to share our tried and tested, home-gold-standard, go-to techniques with you, for maximum mushrooms for everyone. Once you understand the basics of creating a mushroom garden, the fungi-filled sky is your limit – you can experiment with different edible species that suit this technique (not all mushrooms grow this way! But we cover that in the workshop below) and try out all kinds of varied ways to bring mushrooms into your garden – solid in the knowledge that whatever you grow will be safe to eat and delicious. So… that’s a beginner’s overview of mushroom gardens. Keen to make one at your place? If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments below and we’ll help you out. Now – some resources for you. Firstly, here’s our free mushroom cultivation guide, which includes an overview on mushroom gardens… Secondly, you might want to also check out our Life Cycle of Fungi guide to get a better understanding of how fungi grows – they’re pretty amazing lifeforms! And understanding their life cycle will really help you troubleshoot and plan for a successful mushroom garden. Our favourite for beginner mushroom garden makers are… And some other suitable species mentioned in the workshop… Everyone’s climate is different and each different species of mushroom will thrive in slightly different growing conditions… so how do you know when to start your garden? Your mycelium will take a few months to run through the substrate, so it’s best to avoid exposing it to freezing winters or hot dry summers during this early phase. Extreme temperatures could kill your freshly inoculated bed or tub, but once the mycelium is established it will be a lot more hardy.  It’s generally best to establish your garden in the milder part of the year, when the temperature is unlikely to go below freezing or above C (F).  In places with hot dry summers where the soil will not freeze in winter, it’s best to start your garden in autumn/fall or early spring to give it the best chance. In places with very cold winters, it’s best to start your garden in late spring to early summer, this way your garden will have time to get established before having to deal with very cold temperatures. If your climate is very cold you may have to protect your bed with a greenhouse of some kind, or bring your tub indoors. Over the years from the feedback of thousands of students from our Home Mushroom Cultivation courses, we’ve gotten to know the best suppliers of mushroom spawn. We’ve put together an up-to-date list of grain spawn suppliers around the globe – with recommendations from us as well. (Please let us know if you have any recommendations for reliable suppliers.) Let us know how you go? And ask any Qs you have below and we’ll do our best to answer. Thanks to everyone who came along to the live workshop!

Community and caregiving can take many forms, in these crazy days. There are big actions and small ones, public and private actions – and all of them important. Recently I’ve started making herbal tea posies from our emerging garden, to leave on sick or isolating friends’ doorsteps… community care in a jar, and at a distance, if you will. Have you ever made a herbal tea posy? They’re pretty great and always appreciated. And you might be surprised how many everyday plants you can add in that are amazingly medicinal – they don’t need to be full of flowers! And if you don’t have a garden, you can likely make a herbal tea posy out of foraged stuff that grows near you, or a mix of store-bought and found. Here’s a rundown of the medicinal herbs in the latest posy I made, plus some ideas for other medicinal posies, using common weeds and wild plants. Before we go any further, I just wanted to flag that, as said above, community and care take many forms, and all are deeply useful, and essential, during this pandemic. So we see a friendly herbal tea posy as an excellent accompaniment to community care essentials like vaccination, mask-wearing, covid-kit making and distribution, vaccine equity and all the other many things that most of us can easily do or participate in to help minimise harm to the most vulnerable in our communities at this time. Just wanted that clear! Ok – to the herbs. The contents of this particular posy reflect this time of year (mid summer, where we are) and basically the toughest plants in our new garden – these medicinal herbs all took off and reached for the sky, in heavy clay soil in our first growing season. I often add thyme and rosemary to this bunch too, but didn’t this day. All these herbs can be added straight to a big teapot of boiling water and steeped (ok maybe don’t add them ALL at once – mix it up a bit?) unless otherwise indicated below, for  minutes before pouring and sipping. It’s a summer garden in a teacup, with lots and lots of great benefits. As with any medicinal plant, check out its known side effects and all those things if you have a health condition or are on meds of some kind, before making a pot. But all of these herbs are considered very gentle and safe medicine, from everything I’ve read and experienced. Pineapple sage (Salvia elegans) is such a winner of a plant. It’s vigorous, tough as old boots, tolerates drought and lots of different soil types, and grows like the clappers. We inherited a large one in the garden when we bought our house – we dug it up, divided it into  chunks, and now all of those are planted and growing just where we want them, most enthusiastically. It has masses of red flowers in the summer, that pollinators and honeyeaters love. Pineapple sage comes to us from Mexico and surrounds, and smells a bit like (wait for it) pineapple, but more sagey. It’s a member of the mint family, makes a gorgeous tea, and has traditionally been used as a nerve tonic to treat anxiety. It’s also used to aid digestion and is great for upset tummies, and is considered a general tonic. Yarrow (Achillea millefolium) comes to us from temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, and its use as a much-loved medicinal goes back many thousands of years. The flowers come in all sorts of colours, and it’s also a dynamic accumulator plant – which means it mines the subsoil for nutrients really effectively, and brings them up to the soil food web in the topsoil of your garden So yarrow is a really important soil builder, as well as being beloved by smaller pollinators, fabulous for use in weed tea fertilizers, and also in tea for us as well! Yarrow is also a medicine chest of a plant- it’s used as a poultice to staunch bleeding and as an analgesic, and taken in tea or other ways it’s used as a general tonic, a blood thinner, great for menstrual pain, and also when you have a cold or the flu. Here’s a great rundown of yarrow benefits and uses. You’ve probably heard of echinacea or coneflower – it’s a common herbal cold and flu medicine. The main part used medicinally is the root (which I did not put in this posy), but the flowers are apparently milder but still beneficial for the same reasons. Echinacea comes to us from the grasslands of Turtle Island / north America, and it’s been an important medicine for a very long time. As said, if you want its benefits, the root is the thing, but my plant is small so I just went with one flower – if you want, you can just marvel at its fractal stigmas while you drink your tea, and leave it in a jar of water. Or add it to your teapot. This is bergamot the herb, not bergamot the flavour used in earl grey tea (which comes from the bergamot citrus)… bergamot has many names including bee balm, Oswego tea, scarlet monarda, red balm, American melissa, Indian’s plume, and mountain balm, and comes to us from Turtle Island / north America, where it has been used medicinally for a very long time. Bergamot (this is the perennial red bergamot – Monarda Didyma – there’s a more lemon-scented one too which is also amazing) is used to increase blood flow, for colds and flu, to aid digestion, and as a relaxant – generally, just the leaves are used, not the stalk, so take them off before you add them to your teapot. Lavender is, apart from being a great and hardy addition to any not-perfectly-watered patches of your garden, beloved by bees and pollinators of all kinds. It comes to us from northern Africa, Europe and across to India. The lavender flowers are best added to your ‘calm down’ teapot, rather than your ‘wake up’ one… it’s famous for its calmative effects (as well as being a digestion aid) and is an excellent wind-down tea (with other calmative herbs) before bed. Shiso is a Japanese perilla, and I planted this one simply to harvest the leaves to colour the umeboshi plums I’m going to make one day. Turns out, shiso is also incredibly awesome in All The Ways, and on top of all that, it’s one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever grown. I’m in love. We treat this like basil, in terms of its growing needs. Shiso as a tea pairs beautifully with lemon by itself, or you can add it to your herbal party-in-a-teapot. Traditionally, shiso tea has been used for treating colds, flu and coughs, to stimulate appetite, and to relieve nausea, hayfever and dermatitis. It’s also an anti-inflammatory, and a bit of a winner. Also amazing in salads, stir-fries, and in all the Japanese and Korean and Chinese shiso ways. Be still my heart, but this plant. My favourite single-herb tea this summer. Minty and slightly liquorice-y and oh so refreshing. Also ridiculously beautiful. And medicinal as well. Yum. Anise hyssop comes to us from the prairies, dry upland forested areas, plains and fields of Turtle Island / north America, and its blue flower cones are beloved by bees. And also me. The stems, leaves and flowers are used in tea to treat cough and fevers, respiratory issues, diarrhoea, and as an expectorant (clearing mucus from lungs and airways). Anise Hyssop is also used for aches and pains, and applied topically for sunburn. It’s also anti-viral, and delicious in cooking as well. Plant  of these short-lived perennials immediately, they will be a gorgeous friend to you. All hail the mints! Down in the berry arbour, where it’s a bit wetter, I’m currently starting a mint library. I have  varieties so far, and I’m by no means finished yet. Looking forward to dividing off each variety as they grow, and passing on to other folk. Anyway, here are two of them – the delicious peppermint, and chocolate mint (which seems pretty pepperminty, other than its slightly more chocolate-y flavour). Peppermint is used, amongst many other things, to aid digestion (it’s our go-to tea for upset tummies), and is also great for concentration – an excellent while-you-work (or just have a think) tea. It’s also an amazing addition to some of the less-delicious-but-still-entirely-awesome herbs – when in doubt, add a bit of peppermint. Speaking here of Salvia officinalis or ‘sagey sage’ as it’s called in our house… this is the sage that we use for cooking, as opposed to the pineapple sage above. Sage comes to us from the Mediterranean, and the Romans considered it a holy plant. Sage is excellent for, but not limited to: menstrual troubles, memory, coughs, sore throats, lung conditions and for lowering blood sugar. It’s a strong flavour, and goes well with honey. Not just a clover! But also a clover, with all their soil-building properties and loveliness. Red clover is a powerhouse of a herb – it’s used for coughs and colds, is an expectorant, and used in menopause treatment as it contains isoflavones, which are a type of phytoestrogen. Red clover is also used for skin conditions and irritations, and is considered to be gentle enough to be used for chronic conditions. It’s usually taken as a tincture but makes a fine addition to any teapot. Calendula is so old and so beloved that you probably have a few ideas for this one… it’s used topically for all sorts of skin conditions, but taken as a tea, it’s used to help swollen lymph nodes and sore throats. If you want to get funky with making basic calendula salve (not a tea, but just while we’re here and all) Milkwooder Koren has this great calendula salve guide. Lemon balm is yet another powerhouse herb – and also super easy to grow, and beloved by bees. It’s taken in a tea for anxiety and restfulness (maybe not a first-thing-tea, although on a stressy day I put it in the morning pot as well and it helps me along) and brain health. Here’s a great article on lemon balm in all its ways… Whew! So that’s ‘all’ that was in this particular posy, but there’s a heap more common herbs and wild plants that could have been in there also… here’s a few you might find in your garden, on your street, or in your local park somewhere… And a few resources – here’s our article on learning to ID wild plants near you, all about Hawthorn, How to Start a Home Herbal Medicine Cabinet, and all our articles about medicinal plants + foraging. So – I hope that’s enough to get you started. Make your first posy for yourself, because without tending to your own health, even just a little bit, it’s really hard to help others. Once you’ve had that first pot of tea, have a look around and a think at what’s in your garden, or could be found nearby. And from there – good luck, happy posy making, and many spare rubber bands to you. May your bunches of goodness be steeped in many a friend’s kitchen, and may we all make our way through this time together. If you decide to take a snap and share your posy (or posies!) on social – please use tag #HerbalTeaPosy, so we can see it too? I feel so deeply grateful to have these herbs to share. Thank you herbs, thank you seed stewards, thank you soil, thank you melukerdee country.  So…. what’s growing near you, either planted or otherwise?

Holiday time is almost here – huzzah! We’re so ready to chill out, potter here and there, cook, swim and generally laze about, taking in the season. Maybe we’ll also have time and headspace for a few simple gentle holiday projects – perhaps you will, too? We’ve gotcha covered. Below are  of our fave low-stress, feel-good projects to tinker on during the holidays – in the kitchen, in the garden and out and about. This past year has been … really something. Good bits, challenging bits and everything in between. It’s kind of felt like three years in one, huh? Back in July, we launched our second-ever online course – Home Mushroom Cultivation – which turned out to be crazy popular. So great to see students all over the world growing delicious and nutritious food at home. (Btw, the course is open for bookings again at the end of January – jump on the waitlist if you’re interested.) We also ran a bunch of mini-workshops online. Did you catch how to harvest rainwater at home, how to build healthy soil, or how to live your best-ever pickle life? All good if you didn’t, we saved the videos for you to watch over the holidays. Plus we wrote a bunch of new articles, and collaborated with other awesome writers too, to bring you heaps of free how-tos and tips we’re learning along the way. By far the most popular have been: how to make no-dig gardens in pots, how to cure olives, and how to prune fruit trees, which has tips for both summer and winter. Tons of great holiday reading to dive into. On the home front, Life at Quoll Hollow has been feeding our souls – and starting to feed our bellies now too.  is set to be a big year of exciting projects for the Milkwood crew. We’re working on our second book (!!) – and did you see our first book, Milkwood, reached k copies out in the wild this year? Amazing. Annnd… just quietly, we’re also working on a new veggie gardening online course for you, with EVERYTHING you need to create a truly awesome (but not overwhelming) backyard veggie patch that feeds your family, and your heart. If your eyes just lit up (like ours do when we think about it) sign up to our newsletter. That’s where we’ll be including progress updates, for now. So much good stuff in the works that we can’t wait to share with you. Alrighty, now onto all those other holiday resources for you to try – in the kitchen, garden and beyond. This time of year can be good for a bit of reflection – and maybe even a time to create some personal goals for . At this point in the year, before we get to the juicy stuff of new skills and habits, we want you to pause and think. What gets your heart racing? What sort of actions, if taken, will lead to real and lasting change in your life? How can you provide for your needs, while enhancing your community and the environment around you? When you clearly articulate your goals, you create a powerful tool to help you make decisions about your life. Goals help us keep focus, and keep us accountable. And it’s been shown that when people commit to goals, especially by writing them down, they are far more likely to achieve them. And we have a handy worksheet to help you do just that. Alrighty, on to some more hands-on projects. We’re heading towards mid-summer here, and we can’t wait for lazy, warm afternoons in the garden, and for stone fruit and berries to ripen. If you’re heading into mid-winter where you are, this list is packed with projects that you can do also. Cooking, pickling, brewing, dehydrating and preserving are top holiday activities. Check out these ideas for how to make the most of summer or winter garden gluts. Delish! Whether it’s peering into rock pools, looking up at enormous tree canopies, or wandering your local laneways, there are so many simple and fun things to outside over the holidays. Here are a few of our faves: All the best for these holidays. We’ll see y’all in the new year with a big bunch of new ideas and inspirations. And big thanks for everything in , we couldn’t do any of this without your support – so thank you, truly. And may all beings be safe and well x.

"Growing food while living in a rental or small space often means using pots, but you don’t necessarily need to buy unsustainable plastic bags of potting mix. You can totally grow your own soil in pots too – and today, Anna Matilda from The Urban Nanna is going to show us how. Take it away, Anna… I’ve lived in  different rental properties over the past decade, but I’ve been reluctant to let that stop me from growing some of my own food. Shorter leases are unfortunately all-too-common in suburban areas of Australia, and as much as I’d love to, it’s not always practical – input:yield-wise – to convert lawn into growing spaces every time I move house. So I’ve become a pot user (the gardening kind!) as a way of growing long-term crops that I can take with me each time moving day comes around. Growing in pots means I can bring my apricot tree and asparagus with me, but there’s only merit in doing so if they’re going to perform well. And we all know half the battle of helping plants succeed is ensuring they have strong, healthy soil to grow in. Commercially sold potting mix and compost is a bit hit and miss. At best, it’s often just coloured chip-bark, sand, artificially added nutrients and wetting agents that will be used up or washed away within a year. At worst, it could be laced with herbicides that kill everything you plant. Plus, good stuff is expensive, and it usually comes wrapped in plastic. No thanks. To ensure it’s worth my time loading up trailers of potted plants each move, I build the soil in them to be as alive and rich as possible by using a diverse range of ingredients in no-dig layers. This includes everything from homemade compost to street tree leaves, toilet rolls to pet fur – if it can be converted into soil, I’ll use it in my no-dig layers. By using what I have around me, not only do I Produce No Waste (permaculture principle ), but I’m Creatively Using and Responding to Change ( permaculture principle ) because the available ingredients around me change from rental to rental, and I constantly adapt my no-dig layers as a result. And since we’re talking about permaculture principles, using up things around me that would normally be considered ‘waste’ is a great way to live Principle : Integrate Rather Than Segregate and Principle : Use Edges and Value the Marginal. The basic idea of no-dig gardening is pretty self-explanatory: you don’t dig. Instead, you build layer upon layer of diverse organic ingredients that will gradually break down into rich, living soil.  You may know this as the ‘lasagne garden’ method and that’s because, in cross-section, a good no-dig bed looks a bit like a beautiful home-baked lasagne. And just like making lasagne, creating a good no-dig bed comes down to getting the proportion of layers right.  In a good no-dig bed, you’ll find a volume ratio of around : nitrogen to carbon. That means to every  parts of nitrogen-rich material in the bed, you’ll see  parts of carbon-rich material. Don’t worry – I’ll give you measurements a bit later, but for now just know this – In its absolute essence, the recipe for a no-dig bed is: Create alternating layers of wet carbon-rich materials and nitrogen-rich materials, then plant in pockets of sifted, mature compost. So far we’ve looked at ‘no-dig beds’, and lots of what you’ll find online will be about using this method to build larger plots or raised garden beds. Which is great. But really, a pot is just a very small garden bed. So there’s no reason the same no-dig method can’t be used in growing containers of all sizes.  In fact, I’ve been doing just that for the past eight years – with great results. I have fruit trees, long-term crops like asparagus and rhubarb, pollinator-attracting flowers, Australian natives, succulents – all happily growing in no-dig filled pots. The only thing I don’t use no-dig layers for is my indoor plants, but I’m looking into ways the method could work there too. As pots generally have adequate drainage, they don’t need the springy base layer of sticks and branches to provide aeration, as most recipes suggest for no-dig beds built on solid surfaces. Equally, they don’t require a weed-suppressive mat of saturated cardboard or newspaper like no-dig beds built up on grass do. The main problem for growing in pots compared to in large garden beds is the soil drying out. So the aim of the game when creating no-dig pots is to set them up with a really good reservoir of moisture at the bottom to start with, and to ensure that each layer is thoroughly saturated before the next is added. It’s also helpful to tightly group pots together, hard up against each other, which reduces the surface area exposed to the elements. To become confident at using no-dig layers, it’s helpful to understand what makes something carbon-rich or nitrogen-rich when building them. So here’s list of some materials you can use for each. At my place, I tend to use pea straw, compost, worm castings and street tree leaves the most, with pea straw being the only ingredient I purchase. Once you’ve gathered a variety of these ingredients, you’re ready to fill your no-dig pots. Remember, you want  parts carbon-rich materials to every  parts of nitrogen-rich material: that’s one and a half times as much ‘brown’ as ‘green’. Collect your nitrogen and carbon ingredients. Here, I’ve got well-rotted, sifted compost (nitrogen); pea straw and street tree leaves that I’d bagged up in autumn (carbon); worm castings (fertiliser); a pot rescued from hard-rubbish collection; and large polystyrene tub from the greengrocer, with drained holes cut in the bottom. You will also need a pot, some hand tools (a sharp knife and something to scoops with), and some seed-raising mix and seeds.  I always start with a mm-mm dense layer of thoroughly saturated pea straw. To make sure it’s wet through, mix the straw with water in a tub or bucket until every strand is wet – you can see it dripping as I squeeze a handful. Then, compact the sodden straw into every corner of your pot by pushing down firmly with your fist. Note that this is the only layer I compact – I want the other layers to remain light and fluffy. Now it’s time to start layering your nitrogen and carbon, beginnng with nitrogen. I start with compost, but you can use anything from the list of possible ingredients above. I tend to add leaves, twigs and small branches and food scraps at the bottom end of the pot as they’ll take a bit longer to break down, and stick to compost and pea straw towards the top layers as they’re more gentle on tender new roots. So, for this first layer – scoop compost over your compacted straw to form a mm layer. Water thoroughly until the layer is saturated all the way through.  Sprinkle fluffy or chopped pea straw over, to form a mm layer. Scatter a sparse layer of fertiliser, no thicker than mm, over the previous carbon layer. Then water thoroughly until the carbon layer and fertiliser are thoroughly saturated. I use worm castings from my worm farm, and a few stowaways usually come along for the ride. I’ve never had a problem with leaving them in.  Make sure that each layer is thoroughly saturated. This helps the layers to break down into rich soil, and also prevents any of the layers becoming hydrophobic (water repellent). The beauty of using no-dig pots is that, just like potting mix, you can plant in them straight away. You just need a pocket of well-sifted compost or seed-raising mix (depending on what you’re planting) to put your plants or seeds into. The idea is, you make a little pocket of super-friendly growing medium to plant into, and by the time the roots of your plant have reached the edges of that pocket, the ingredients of the no-dig layers will have begun to break down and provide suitable structure for good root growth.  I like to think of the compost/seed raising mix as a ‘cot’ that the plants live in while they’re young and fragile, and the no-dig layers as the ‘bed’ they graduate into. As the organic layers in your no-dig pots begin to break down, the soil level in the pot will drop significantly. Don’t fret though: the simple solution is to just add as many repeated layers of Step - as needed to top it back up again.  A good rule of thumb is to add new layers every time you plant something new. If you’re only replacing a small plant in a big pot, just add new layers for the individual new plant. Every autumn, I always give my pots a lovely deep mulching layer of street tree leaves, which means that unless I’m filling new pots, I really only need to buy pea straw once a year, as that’s enough to top-dress my -odd pots just fine. So there you have it: growing in pots using no-dig methods. It’s quick, easy, and if you put a bit of thought into it, can be cheap as chips.

Ready to learn to pickle? We’ll get you started with our favourite bomb-proof pickling and lacto-fermentation methods – using whatever veggies you’ve got (in your garden OR your fridge). Learning how to make delicious, nutritious, lacto-fermented pickles is an excellent way to increase your household’s resilience AND make your tummy very happy, both at once. And it’s dead-easy, once you know the basics. The best bit about pickling? You don’t need and fancy equipment or ingredients – you can get started living your best pickle life with just salt, water, a jar or two, and whatever veg you’ve got in your fridge. Pickles are a central part of our home kitchen – pickling is an incredible way to store seasonal veg, and also a great way to add extra diversity to your diet and your biome, at any time of year. And no matter where you live, there’s something near you that can be pickled, right now.  So! Here’s our recent online mini-workshop that just happened – and then below that there’s the recipes we show you, plus some of our favourite resources to get you pickling. Please ask any questions you have below, we’re super happy to help! Firstly, thanks so much to all the folks who showed up LIVE for the above workshop – it was so lovely to have you in there with us! Below are the recipes and some resources for you to get going with… So here’s a very basic and delicious sweet/sour vinegar pickle that couldn’t be much easier. As said in the workshop, this recipe was gathered from our friend Olivier Sofo of Living Earth Farm, over a decade ago. It really is just vegetables, vinegar, sugar, salt and spices. You can definitely do this. Take your clean jar, and add your spices to the bottom. Then, add your thinly sliced veg, and pack it down. Heat your vinegar to a minimum of  degrees c (you don’t need to boil it) and carefully pour over the veg in your jar. Fill to top of jar, and cap tightly. Flip the jar upside down, and leave on the bench until cool. When cool, flip the jar back upright, label, and store in the cupboard for  weeks before eating. Great as a snack with cheese, or on sandwiches, or in salads, or whatever. Enjoy! This super simple recipe is to get you started, and then once you’ve got your head around lacto-fermented brines, the sky is your limit! Fermenting vegetables in brine is a form of lacto-fermentation – it’s similar to making sauerkraut, but even easier. For this fermenting process, you are relying on the good yeasts and bacteria present on the skins of fresh, organic veg, and using them to ferment your veggies into probiotic powerhouses – with the aid of a simple mix of fresh water and salt: ie a brine. Lacto-fermentation refers to the lactic acids that the yeasts and bacteria, which live on your veg + fruit, create when they ferment. These microbes, whose job it is to protect your veg from untimely moulds and pests, are the basis of many vegetable ferments that people have been making for thousands of years. Because when these microbes are introduced to a brine, they proceed to ferment both the brine and their host vegetables into a safe, ‘pickled’ food, which contains millions more ‘good bugs’ than the vegetable in its raw form. Plus they taste great. Crunchy salty-sour goodness. Yum. A note on salt, and water: try and find an unadulterated salt to use for this type of recipe – sea salt is great, rock salt is fine. Check the ingredients and avoid anything with added iodine or anti-caking agents. For the water – use rain or spring water, if you can. Tap water, with its various additives, will work less well. But if that’s all you’ve got, use tap water – don’t let that stop you! So! Let’s go. This % brine recipe can be used for most ‘hard’ veggies – you could try carrots, radishes, daikon, beetroot and so on. The pic above is a % brine with garlic scapes and asparagus – this is a seriously versatile recipe! Chop your veg into sticks, slices or however you roll. We’ll use carrots for the recipe below. Chop your carrots into a shape that you like to eat – sticks, slices, sparkly stars – its up to you. Then, add a few spices (optional) to the bottom of your clean jar, and then pack in the carrots. Leave a few cm headroom at the top. Wedge the carrots in as much as you can, and if you have some of the leaves mentioned above, push them down on top – this will help keep the carrots under the brine. Now – make up your % brine. You might want to halve the salt and water above, if you’re sure you’ll only need ml of brine – but more is better, and the extra can always be stored in the fridge, labelled, until you make another pickle in the near future? Add the salt and water to a bowl, and stir the salt into the water to dissolve. If your salt is in larger chunks, you might want to add a little of that water to the bowl as boiling water, dissolve the salt in that, then add the rest of the water as cold. If your brine is tepid when it goes into the jar, this isn’t a problem. Now – pour the brine into your jar, and fill to the top. Make sure all the veg are safely underneath the brine, and not floating above it. Lid your jar loosely, and place on a plate on your kitchen bench for the next - days. The fermentation process will mean that the jar bubbles a little, expelling some of the liquid – this is fine! Taste the carrots after day , and each day thereafter, until they taste good to you – they will become more sour and delicious with each day, but different people like different levels of sour – so learn what works for you. Once your pickles taste as you like them – put them in the fridge to slow the fermentation process. They will remain taste-stable for…. ages! But do eat them in the next few months. We use the recipe from Sandor Katz’s Wild Fermentation book for the % half-sour gherkins that we showed you in the video…. happily, the recipe is also online on Sandor’s website here. For this recipe, I’m going to point you at our blog archive, rather than explain it twice! The below recipe is the same as explained in the workshop video above – int he workshop I used red cabbage, grated carrot and grated fennel. But as the recipe below explains… you can use prettymuch whatever greens (or veg) you’ve got… Here’s just a few of our (many) fave fermentation + pickle books – please feel free to suggest more below, so we can check out your faves also? Got any questions? Fave recipes to share? Please let us know below, we’d love to hear. Happy pickling to you.

We’re pretty chuffed to be celebrating a big milestone! There are ,+ copies of Milkwood – Real Skills for Down to Earth Living in the bookshelves, laps, ebook readers, kitchen tables, and garden benches of awesome people across the world. It took us many years to gather and learn all this knowledge on our favourite subjects, before releasing the first Milkwood book out into the world almost exactly  years ago. And it was very much a group effort – so many mentors and friends helped along the way. Thank you, one and all! In the book, there are histories, DIY projects, recipes, guides, and methods of all kinds, and most importantly the *motivation* to get going or to dive in deeper. We’re so grateful to see our book pop up all over the place, giving folk real skills to grow amazing tomatoes and mushrooms, forage for wild food and seaweed, and to keep bees naturally. You folks are amazing. It makes us so happy to see the fruits of your labours on plates, in baskets, jars, bottles, hives and tummies – it’s been an amazing journey so far. So, as you may know, the book has five chapters, each focussing on a different topic – The Tomato, Mushroom Cultivation, Natural Beekeeping, Seaweed and Wild Food. If you haven’t read Milkwood yet – we’ve published a bunch of free resources over past couple years, all based on extracts from the five different chapters of our book: By the way, you can find copies of the book at all good libraries too. In other news, there’s a second Milkwood book afoot – it’s currently in the writing and wrangling stage. Looking forward to sharing it with you all one day in the not-too-distant future. Until then, writing, pickling, digging, doing. Hope you are well in this season, through all that’s being navigated, by us all. A big Thank you to all the Insta-folk who have been using our hashtag, #MilkwoodBook. It’s awesome to see Milkwood books out in the wild! Check some of them out here:  Thanks, lastly, to all the beautiful and amazing independent bookstores who have supported us through this journey, we couldn’t have done this without you. If you’re after a copy or two of Milkwood, please support them! We also sell signed copies and post Australia-wide – over here. We acknowledge that permaculture owes the roots of its theory and practice to traditional and Indigenous knowledges, from all over the world.

How much do you know about the lifecycle of fungi? You share % of your DNA with them, so you’re basically family. And did you know that fungi are not plants, and they’re not animals… but an entirely different queendom! Whether you’re simply a mushroom-lover or you want to grow your own mushrooms at home, learning about the lifecycle of fungi is a fantastic way to get to know your ecosystem a little better. Mind you – not all fungi roll the same way, when it comes to their lifecycles – not at ALL. For every biological rule, there is a fungus that breaks it, so it makes sense that there are some pretty big differences in life-cycles depending on the species. Because we often share about how to grow *wood-loving, mushroom-producing fungi*, that’s the specific lifecycle we’re going to tell you all about today – and what better way to do this than to share a lesson from inside our Home Mushroom Cultivation online course with you! So – how does a mushroom become a mushroom? Let’s take a look at the whole lifecycle of wood-loving macro fungi. This video introduces the parts, stages and functions of a saprobic macro fungus (yep, like the ones you love to eat).  By understanding the stages in the lifecycle of a fungus, when you start growing your own mushrooms (or are just hanging out with wild ones in your garden), you’ll be able to recognise what the mycelium is doing and key signs of development – for example, when they are ready to fruit… How amazing is mycelium? So now you understand where the actual mushroom stage of the life cycle fits into the world of fungi. Well done – this is fundamental stuff. Understanding the fungi life cycle and how they reproduce is a great way to get closer to your ecosystem, and understand more about the fungi that you find around you. Learning about the fungi life cycle also enables you to use small, slow solutions to create abundance in your own garden, once you start growing mushrooms. Keen to learn more? We have a friendly and comprehensive course for that… Thanks to Catherine Marciniak (Fungi in South East Asia []) & Almir Rizvanovic for their mushroom footage used in the lesson above. No worries – leave a comment below and we can answer whatever you’re wondering. Good luck with learning the ways of the fungi!

Learning about your garden’s soil – what it actually is, and how to improve it to create a nourishing foundation or your garden – is an excellent way to increase your household’s resilience AND grow your best-ever veggies, both at once. And it’s dead-easy, once you know the basics. In the video below (which was a live mini-workshop), you can learn all about the basics of your garden soil – it’s makeup, it’s mysteries, and how you can improve the soil at your place. In this mini workshop, we first explore the wonderful ecosystem that is soil, with a bit of help from author, organic farmer and also our mate Matthew Evans (whose latest book is SOIL… yep, you can see where we’re going with that one!). Then, we dive into what actually makes up soil, the different types that you’ll commonly find in your garden, and how to figure out exactly what components make up YOUR soil, so you can improve it, to enhance your garden and grow more nutritious food. Rightio – feeling inspired about the wonders of soil in general, and your garden’s soil in particular? Once you’ve watched the workshop, check out the resources below – including our awesome Soil Type Calculator – which we made for you so you can de-code your soil’s texture. And if you’ve got questions? Comment below, and we can help you out. We can’t wait to see you get started on creating your best-ever soil. As Nick said, there are many different perspectives that we can use to examine our soil. You can think of them kind of like ‘lenses’ that you can look at the soil through… One lens is the structure lens. How soil behaves physically, how it holds together and how it holds onto other things. Another lens is chemistry. What elements and compounds are in the soil, how they interact with your plants, and how easy they are for your plants to access. And another lens is the biology. The wonderful world of lifeforms living in your soil, and how you can make them thrive and multiply. And even all THIS isn’t all there is to soil… but let’s start with the lenses above, to keep things simple. It’s through ensuring each aspect of your soil is in balance, that you can have truly thriving, healthy soil. The structure of your soil determines how the soil physically behaves. This will also influence the soil chemistry and how easy it is for soil biology to multiply and thrive. In a structural sense there are four main ingredients that determine how soil behaves – like Matthew talked about int he workshop, the biggest part are the mineral solids of sand, silt & clay – they make up nearly half the volume. And only a small part of healthy soil is actually organic matter – this includes all the living things, it’s less than % of the volume The rest of your soil isn’t solid at all – it’s water & air and together they take up about half the volume too. The actual amount of air and water varies quite a lot as you water your garden or it rains, and as it dries back out. This is why it’s incredibly important to avoid compaction in your soil – that water and air are crucial to creating a healthy soil structure. How your soil behaves structurally is down to the ratio of sand, silt and clay in that ‘mineral solids’ part in the pic above. Before we get to the jar test (which is a great DIY way to find out more about your soil) – start with your hands! Take a bit of your soil, and do a ribbon test. This will reveal how much clay you have in your soil: It’s a REALLY good idea to start with this test, because it will tell you upfront how much clay is in your soil. The jar test below is ace, but there’s *some types* of clay soil that disperse weirdly in water, which might lead you to thinking that you don’t have much clay in your soil, when actually you’ve got heaps. So – do the ribbon test first – it will help your understanding of what comes next. So Nick explains the jar test in the video above, but here’s The Jar Test bit of the video again, incase you missed it. Make sure you take your soil sample from the root zone of your plants – not the very top of the surface. This will give you a more accurate result. Once you’ve done your jar test, you can move on to the soil type calculator! Once you’ve done your jar test, punched the results into the calculator below, and you know what type of soil you have – you can start to figure out how best to support and build up your particular soil. Knowing your soil type texture will inform all kinds of decisions when you’re getting things growing – from how best to plant your fruit trees, to what you can expect from your veggie beds in a drought year. And no matter what type of soil you have, there’s things you can do to improve it. Check if you have ‘dispersive clays’ in your soil, which need a special approach – There’s a video in the calculator page above that explains how to test if you do – go have a watch. A note about ‘claybreaker’ – if you have heavy clays, you might see info around recommending that you add gypsum, otherwise known as ‘claybreaker’, to help amend your soil structure. As with any inputs – read carefully before applying! Using cover crops that also have tap roots can be a great way to improve heavy clay soils – here’s a great video from Sarvodaya Institute about using Daikon (and other things) to help improve soil structure (and biology, and everything else). The next lens you can use to look at your soil is the Chemistry lens. The chemistry of the soil affects the structure and the biology of your soil. You might already be familiar with with the ‘big three’ plant nutrients – Nitrogen, Phosphorus & Potassium (sometimes shortened to NPK) But calcium, magnesium and sulphur and their compounds are also important nutrients and can dramatically affect soil structure. And then there is Zinc, Boron, Manganese, Iron & (Nick’s favourite) Molybdenum! These are the major ones, but there are many many more and then thousands of compounds of these elements that make up a dizzying array of nutrients & just like US, the plants, animals & microbes that live in your soil need a wide range of these nutrients to thrive.  Thankfully you don’t need to know exactly how many of each of these elements and their compounds are in your soil! But it’s good to understand that they are there. Why does all this matter? Because your soil’s chemistry deeply affects the health of the soil food web. Your soil’s chemistry also affects what kinds of nutrients your garden plants have access to – so if there’s great and useful nutrients in your soil, but the chemistry is out of whack – your plants won’t be able to access that nourishment Which means less nutrient-dense harvests for YOU. This is why some basic soil testing can be a good idea, if you’re worried about your soil’s chemical balance, OR if you have reason to suspect that your soil might have some nasties in it, like heavy metals. The best place to start is with a simple pH test. So if you just do one test on your soils chemistry, do this one. You can do a pH test easily at home, and once you understand the results, you can take steps to help ensure nutrients are available to your plants and biology, and that any heavy metals that are in your soil have less impact. Make sure you take your soil sample from the root zone of your plants – not the very top of the surface. This will give you a more accurate result. As we explain in the article below, taking a few samples from your veggie patch, rather than just one sample, will give you broader accuracy. As Nick said in the workshop, soil nutrients become locked up in really alkaline soils, and metals dissolve and become soluble poisons in very acidic soils. So neither of these are ideal for your garden. Either way, most plants won’t grow really well unless your soils are somewhere in the middle . – . pH, which is considered the most neutral. There’s a lot of great places that you can send a sample of your soil to get it tested for… whatever you want, really. The different testing labs range in price, and some of the results that they send back will be easier to read than others. There’s soil testing labs in most countries, so find one near you. The two we’ve used in Australia (there’s also other good ones) are: The final lens by why we can look at our soil is biology. Why is soil biology so important? Well, apart from being an amazing ecosystem which is crucial to addressing the climate crisis, the biology in your soil… You might think of soil biology in terms of the things you can see, like earth worms. But, in fact, there is a dizzying array of different creatures down there… a wild and diverse ecology that rivals the most complex ecosystems on earth… and it’s right beneath our feet! There are nematodes and arthropods, bacteria, protozoa and our favourite, the fungi. Above is a pic of Dr Elaine Ingham – though her organisation The Soil Food Web, Dr Ingham is a soil science leader – she has made it her life’s work to help farmers (and the rest of us) understand of the importance of life in the soil. Not sure what we mean about all this soil life? Well – So you want to support your soil’s biology. Is it worth adding specific biology, like bacteria, protozoa, worms or fungi? Well, maybe. But you’re better off starting by ensuring your soil conditions support your existing soil microorganisms by: If you get really enthused, you can add biology (or inoculate) your soils with Actively Aerated Compost Teas, but making them is not a simple process (though you can try!) – and that process starts with making really great compost. So often it’s easiest to inoculate you garden with good-quality compost directly… compost will add microorganisms & the nutrients & food that they need, all in one hit. To wrap all this knowledge up, here’s what we think are the most effective ways to create heathy soil at your place: As we said at the start of this article – SOIL isn’t just it’s structure, chemistry and biology… there’s all sorts of other knowledges and understandings of what soil is, and how we can co-habitate with this amazing ecosystem that extends into us, and into everything we share this world with. There’s a lot to think about here, so here’s a few titles to get you started Got suggestions for other reads that should be on this list? Let us know! Always keep in mind that you can support healthy soils, both near you and further away, by eating a wide range of plants and supporting local growers who take good care of their soil. By doing these things, you are supporting your own health, your local soil’s health, and caring for your community too, by supporting local food systems. This workshop was an extended lesson from one of the many subjects that we teach inside our online course, Permaculture Living. If you’re curious, you can check the course out here.

"This week we’ve called in the wisdom of Keitha Thuy Young – a South Australian farmer and folk herbalist living with disability – to show you how easy it can be to get your own home herbal medicine cabinet started… Herbal medicine grows wild all around us – and learning to gather these wild ‘weeds’ to craft your own simple home herbal remedies can be immensely supportive for yourself, your family and your local community. So I’m delighted to share five of these medicinal wild plants with you – many are popping up now, being springtime here in the Southern Hemisphere – along with three easy herbal recipes so you can start building your home medicine cabinet right away. Humans everywhere have evolved and survived by working with their local plants for healing and, as these mostly forgotten traditions make a resurgence, this way of being in relationship with plants is more accessible than you may think, wherever you are in the world. A common misconception is that herbalism is only for professionals, but I’m a firm believer that anyone can be a herbalist. By definition, a ‘herbalist’ is: “Someone who works with plants for healing.” Wise traditions of folk herbalism are present in all Indigenous cultures, originating from the people and working with local medicinal plants for the people. So if you’ve heard the plants calling you, I encourage you to listen – start by getting to know just a few herbs and to feel empowered to try crafting your own home herbal medicine cabinet.  While I do believe that tending a medicinal herb garden is one of the most grounding, beautiful and joyous things one can do, maybe you’re not quite there yet? The good news is that most wild plants (usually called ‘weeds’) have multitudes of medicinal qualities to offer – and they’re so common they’re almost certainly growing near you. Additionally, the recipes below are all crafted using accessible kitchen items – tools that are probably already in your kitchen – such as sieves, scissors and glass jars (reused/recycled are great, it doesn’t have to be fancy). And the only ingredients you’ll need, aside from your gathered herbs, are kitchen shelf regulars – apple cider vinegar and honey. Folk herbalism is simple in its essence because it has been readily practiced and passed down by many through millennia. Of course, plant medicine is incredibly powerful (and can be potentially dangerous), so there are some herbs that I wouldn’t use without consulting a clinical herbalist. But all of the herbs used below delightfully blur the line between medicine + food, meaning that you don’t have to worry about dosage and they are safe for all ages to consume. So grab your baskets (witches hat optional) and let’s go make some herbal medicine. First up, acknowledging whose unceded lands you are on and supporting your local Indigenous community is always a good place to start expressing gratitude for the abundance and nourishment that this land offers us. Then there are some ethical foraging guidelines if you are out gathering wild herbs, such as: I’m also big on asking the plants for permission and leaving an offering or act of care – perhaps a new and strange concept for some, but one that continually feels important for me as I attempt to be in right relationship with the land and plants. When it comes to foraging safely and gaining plant ID confidence, Kirsten addresses this wonderfully in her article ‘Learn  Wild & Useful Plants Near You’, as well as outlining why working with local plants is such a nourishing practice. Starting out in folk herbalism can feel very daunting. With so many herbs, scientific names and healing constituents to learn, it is easy to feel overwhelmed. But one of my teachers taught me that all the medicine you and your family could ever need can be found in just ten plants that are probably already growing wild near you. I hope this emboldens you to begin getting to know only a few herbs (or even just one) that you’ve noticed or been feeling drawn to. Once you delve into learning about them you’ll be amazed at how many layers of healing each herb offers. And as you build your herbal knowledge, remember that the best way to learn isn’t just through books or articles, but through the lived experience of working directly with the plant. So, with all that in mind – here are three simple, folk herbalism recipes to start building your confidence, start building plant relationships and start building your home herbal medicine cabinet. Herbal-infused vinegars are a very old, traditional medicine whereby the vinegar extracts and preserves the medicinal properties of the herbs without the need for alcohol used in tinctures, making them favourable for regular use, for children and for folks avoiding alcohol. What I love about this herbal remedy is that it’s taking vinegar, an ingredient found in almost every household, and infusing it with all the extra minerals, healing and nutrition that herbs offer. It’s then easy to infuse this additional medicine into your everyday routine and diet. You can use any kind of vinegar you prefer – I like to use organic apple cider vinegar, a potent medicine in its own right. Then once all that herbal goodness is infused, you are free to use your vinegar lavishly, in the same way you’d normally add it to foods and salads. This particular recipe features three spring herbs, incredibly rich in minerals that help to nourish and refresh the body after a winter (perhaps?) of eating dense comfort foods. And there’s a good chance that one, if not all, of these herbs will be readily growing as ‘weeds’ in your backyard or neighbourhood. But ultimately, there’s no ‘right way’ to do a folk herbal recipe. There is so much space for variation depending on the season, on what plants are local and accessible to you, your level of knowledge and, simply, what kind of medicine you want to make. So the short answer for herbal vinegars is – you can use any (edible) herb. Remember that vinegar will extract the nutrients and medicinal properties present in the plants you choose to infuse, so you can select these according to your accessibility and needs. This recipe uses fresh herbs, but dried herbs are also really good to infuse. They create a herbal vinegar with a longer shelf life (due to lower water content) – although your fresh herb vinegar should still be good for at least a year. If using dried herbs, be aware of their quality – they should still smell vital, not old and oxidised, otherwise their medicine won’t be as potent. Nettle is one of my all-time favourite herbs because it so easily moves between being both a food and a medicine, it is – food as medicine! During its winter-spring growing season, I am continually harvesting handfuls to make iron-rich tea or to add to soups as a highly nutritious green, as well as hanging bunches to dry to use once it can no longer be found fresh.  It is a very hardy and highly adaptable herb, found growing wild in almost any climate, usually in stands several metres wide. Here in Australia, you will most likely find the annual ‘Lesser Nettle (Urtica urens), compared to the perennial ‘Greater Nettle’ (Urtica dioica) more commonly found wild in Europe and North America. Both are commonly known as Stinging Nettle for their distinct capacity to give you a burning sting (you’ll know it if/when you brush past them!) And while this sting also offers legendary pain relief, you won’t have to worry about being stung by your vinegar as drying, heating or infusing renders this stinging chemical useless – although donning a pair of gloves may bring some needed bravery during harvest. Harvest should ideally be done before nettle goes to seed (you’ll know this has occurred if you see little light green flowers near their leaf joins) as after this, its silica content significantly rises which can cause headaches in some. However, if seedy nettle is all you can find, you can still harvest at this stage – just make a cup of tea from a few leaves to test that it doesn’t cause you headaches.  Nettle’s nutritional medicine is incredibly vast, with Vitamins A, B, B, B, B, C, D, E and K, and high mineral levels of calcium, iron, potassium, zinc, magnesium and many more. They also offer anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, tonifying and circulatory benefits… your salad dressing just got super healthy! A powerful addition to your home herbal medicine cabinet. Chickweed and dandelion are the next two herbs – you can find out a little more about these herbs in Kirsten’s blog ‘Learn  Wild & Useful Plants Near You‘, but here’s a bit more about harvesting their medicine. Chickweed (Stellaria media) usually appears from autumn to spring here in our temperate climate, but given some shade and enough moisture it can grow all year round. It has a few toxic look-alikes, so be vigilant when gathering. But a confident ID can be made by spotting the mohawk of fine hair that travels up their stem and shifts by a quarter turn at every leaf join. Found growing low and sprawling, Chickweed is a fragile plant that doesn’t dry well so is typically used fresh. Leave the roots in and just ‘cut and come again’ by snipping off the top cm or so and it will quickly regrow more nutritious abundance. This slight, green ‘weed’ offers some very potent cooling and soothing actions which aid in healing ulcers, bowel disorders and inflammatory conditions of the gut. It also offers support for respiratory ailments, helps to regulate intestinal flora, is a metabolic balancer, and being rich in chlorophyll makes a very nutritious, delicious pesto. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) has for too long been sprayed out of lawns and footpaths, with its immense healing benefits forgotten by most – but the ‘officinale’ in its scientific name gives evidence of the many centuries and long history of its medicinal use and herbal lore. So much could be praised upon this plant that has so generously spread itself all around the world, from the digestive support found in its bitter qualities, to the way it helps alkalise the body, to its strengthening of liver function. But I’ll leave the rest for your self-study, as there are gratefully so many resources now that give this humble herb the respect it deserves. All of this green healing goodness, from just three weeds! Now that you’re acquainted with these wild herbs, we’re ready to infuse them into vinegar so we can enjoy their abundant medicine throughout the year… You’ll need: Folk method: Suggested use: Mix into a salad dressing; splash on top of steamed veggies; add a dash to your soup, stew or bone broth; take a medicinal teaspoon in your morning routine or even sponge it diluted onto feverish skin to help reduce temperatures – experiment with your herbal infused vinegar and enjoy. Another very old remedy, herbal honeys have been used through millennia for their many therapeutic properties. Same as vinegar, honey on its own is a reputable medicine – it is antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immune-enhancing, which makes it another wonderful carrier for herbal infusions in your home kitchen. When sourcing your honey, if it’s not from a hive that you tend, try to source organic and as local as possible, if this is accessible for you. Many mainstream supermarket honeys are cut with sugar syrup and ethical beekeeping needs our support if our bee friends are to make it through. This may be a good opportunity to seek and build relationships with beekeepers in your community – you could offer to give them back some delicious infused herbal honey as a trade. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) is an aromatic, anise-tasting herb whose tall umbels can often be found growing wild along roadsides. With more of a reputation for its culinary uses, I rarely hear folks discussing fennel’s long history as an immensely revered medicine – but here is another instance where food becomes medicine and medicine can be food. Note: high doses of fennel are not recommended during pregnancy. Perhaps most well known for digestion support before or after meals (think the sugar-coated fennel seeds of India), Fennel also stimulates the metabolism, assists the liver, strengthens ailing eyes, helps to clear phlegm and can be used for both dry and moist coughs. So when paired with honey, which also relieves dryness and pain in the throat, fennel can be a great ally through the cold season. Much herbal lore around fennel also gives it a reputation for promoting energy, vitality, and courage. Isabell Shipard shares that “athletes preparing for early Olympics, consumed large amounts of fennel seed in honey to build strength and endurance…” so I hope you’re feeling inspired to make some of this magic potion for your home herbal medicine cabinet. You’ll need:  Folk method: Suggested use: Add a teaspoon of your fennel-infused honey to a warm herbal tea, chai tea or milk tea; spread it on some warm buttered toast or take a little directly off a spoon, three times a day during illness – and may you feel the courage and strength of an Olympian. An oxy-what??… Yet another folk remedy that goes back thousands of years, an oxymel is simply equal parts acid (‘oxy’) and honey (‘mel’). Most commonly made from apple cider vinegar and honey – these two ingredients, which we’ve already worked with above, come together in a : ratio to make a delightfully sweet and sour tonic that supports respiratory issues and immunity building. I’d heard for a long time about the immunity support that olive leaf offers, but it wasn’t until a dear friend sent me a bottle of their own handmade oxymel that I got to experience for myself what a powerful immune ally this often wild plant (and often vilified weed) is.  This winter, anytime that we felt the beginning of a sniffle or throat tickle we would take some and then wake up the next day with all symptoms gone. My toddler loves to take it too (oxymels are safe, wonderful medicines for kids) and as such, as a family, we’ve had no colds this season. I’m in deep awe and appreciation.  Olive leaf can help fight all types of infections as well as reduce inflammation, ease arthritis, lower blood pressure and is touted to help prevent many types of chronic diseases. I can’t recommend this remedy enough for your family herbal medicine cabinet, especially with support through colds and flu. You’ll need:  Folk method: Suggested use: Take as needed at the first sign of a cold or flu: if you used a dropper bottle, take a dropper-full three times a day, or else just a poured teaspoon three times a day, until symptoms recede. If using as preventative medicine, one teaspoon/one dropper-full a day will aid your body’s resilience greatly. — Well, I know that was a lot of information, but if you’re still here – I hope you’re feeling inspired by all of this herbal goodness and you’ve gleaned just how much medicine and magic the plants offer us all. Delve in, be bold, and know that no matter what level you’re at with your herbal knowledge, we all have the potential to deepen these healing relationships more by bringing them into our homes. So go forth, make friends with your wild plants and enjoy building your home herbal medicine cabinet.

In a little mountain community in northeast New South Wales (Australia), a new community garden has sprung up these past few months – complete with a specially designed seat that’s part of a statewide food waste reduction experiment. It’s all thanks to a group of local go-getters who wanted their small Nundle township to have better access to fresh veggies, local seeds, composting and knowledge sharing. The garden spreads across what was once m of lawn between the local library and council depot, on a bit of land owned by the Tamworth Regional Council. Its formation began when the local Upper Peel Landcare Group got back together with a few new faces – folks who “have a passion for sustainability and practical solutions”, says Rachel Webster. She’s one of the key instigators, and got thinking about all this while studying our Permaculture Living course. Cool, huh? So – the group managed to secure two grants totaling $,, from the Tamworth Regional Landcare Association and Tamworth Regional Council, and with that, they were off. We spoke with Rachel and fellow organiser Karlee Burgess about how they made the garden happen, and what this new garden space means for their somewhat isolated community… Rachel: Yes! I’ve long been fascinated with the idea of having shared community spaces to grow food. Then Karlee made the suggestion that a community garden would work well with the existing seed library… Karlee: The Nundle Library has a Seed Library, which is actually part of the Central Northern Regional Libraries (CNRL) seed network. The seeds are distributed to a number of participating library branches across the state. Though CNRL does get donations from kind gardeners, a lot of our seeds are from commercial suppliers. This is an expense, and in the era of economic rationalism, libraries are not exactly awash with money. But such a visionary project has the capacity to really help. In some of these communities, the means to grow free food could be game-changing. So the question in my mind was how to cut the cost, but continue to expand the service. I love permaculture and veggie growing, so when I came to work at Nundle Library it seemed like a no-brainer to have a community food garden supplying a portion of seeds to the network as one of its many uses. And of course, we can raise seeds to supply the garden. So, Rachel and the rest of our amazing team of Upper Peel Landcare volunteers, CNRL and Tamworth Regional Council have developed this partnership. Rachel: I’m so glad you asked! It wasn’t planned, but the Cool Seat has become a focal point in our garden. When planning our garden opening event, we wanted to a well-known keynote speaker. Michael Mobbs immediately came to mind – he has driven the suburb-wide transformation of Chippendale in Sydney, which includes edible gardens on the road verges and a community composting system. Michael suggested we might be able to install a Cool Seat at our opening event. The Cool Seat is essentially a compost bin that sits within a self-watering wicking garden bed. The compost bin is embedded in the centre of the raised garden bed and is topped with a lid that becomes a bench that you sit on. The design is such that the decomposing food is completely odorless. So you can happily sit on the bench, eating your lunch, maybe adding a few herbs from the garden that surrounds you. If you have any leftovers you can lift the bench/lid, pop them into the compost bin and the food waste will then be turned into wonderful compost and essential nutrients for the plants in the garden, thanks to the effort of s of worms. It’s genius! There are several of these Cool Seats around New South Wales including in Orange, Bathurst, Chippendale and now in Nundle. The goal is to reduce food waste from local cafes. For every kg of food waste that is recycled, CO emissions are reduced by kg. We recycle about kg of food waste from two Nundle cafes and a guest house every week. The amount of waste that is collected is recorded and this is forming data to help paint a better picture of the amount of food that is wasted from cafes. As Australia is one of the Top  countries in the world in terms of emissions from food waste, this is a great strategy and I’m so proud of our local businesses for being involved. Rachel: Our opening event, called the ‘Winter Solstice and Garden Launch Lunch’, captured the spirit of this garden entirely. About  people from our region came together to listen to local music, learn, become inspired, swap stories and share fresh, locally grown and prepared food. It was important to us that our garden opening was a celebration of not only community and growing food but of our connection as humans to the seasons and to nature as a living, breathing being. It was a gentle, joyful day with children running and playing, music and laughter floating across our village, and people swapping food and produce that they had grown. It’s heart-warming to see how bringing a diverse group of people together can be the seed that fosters all kinds of connections and sustainability outcomes. Rachel: To start with, we put in the usual winter greens – spinach, rocket, pak choy plus some herbs, chives, onions, shallots and a lemon tree. The climate of Nundle is similar to Tasmania in that it gets very cold up here in these mountains. The winter growing season in Nundle is quite challenging and I myself am still mastering the timing of planting. Unfortunately, we were just a little bit late to catch the early autumn planting, so the seedlings we put in have been a bit slow to take off. One of the most important things I learned in the Permaculture Living Course was about observing your environment. Trial and error is an important aspect of gardening, but sitting back and observing the movement of the sun, studying the flow of water through the landscape, all of the subtle cycles in nature, can save time in the long run. We will certainly know this for next year based on what we have observed in our garden over this winter season. We are limited to raised garden beds due to existing underground infrastructure, but we will keep adding more beds as we go. At the moment we have about six raised beds including our Cool Seat garden bed. Rachel: Yes, Nundle is located  minutes from the closest regional centre of Tamworth, so growing food here is a logical solution to minimise both the cost and hassle of travelling into town to buy fruit and veggies. We don’t expect to feed the whole of Nundle from our garden but we hope to inspire and encourage people to grow their own food – because it’s a critical step in solving many issues, such as energy costs due to broadscale food production and transport. The keen gardeners in Nundle have so much knowledge to share and we must pass this on to our next generation. I personally have gained some great little tricks around growing food more effectively in this climate from a friend who has lived here for a long time and is in her s. This kind of knowledge is priceless and is a key to growing food successfully. Plus, finding excuses to bring people together and support one another, especially in times of hardship, is essential in small and isolated communities. Rather than focusing on our differences, when we come together in celebration of food, arts, innovation and knowledge, we can turn our mindset from negativity to one of positivity and hope. Building relationships and sharing ideas is so powerful. Already our group is planning some bigger projects, such as a community solar project and a fuel recharging station for electric vehicles. Rachel: I started the Permaculture Living course during the first lockdown in  and it was such a time of inward reflection. Yet this was beautifully complemented by being reminded to look up, look around and observe what is happening in nature. The first permaculture principle – ‘observe and interact’ – has been the most powerful one for me personally and certainly a huge motivator in helping to establish this garden. Less time locked to a screen broadened my world and enabled me to reevaluate how I could make a meaningful contribution to the world. It quickly became clear that this endeavour is not something to do alone. A little SWOT analysis helped me to recognise that one of the strengths of our mountain community is that there are many highly resourceful people with amazing skills in making a lot out of not much. ‘Capturing and storing energy’ is the second permaculture principle and in our community this is particularly relevant in the area of knowledge and skills around gardening and preserving food. In the country, people are often more isolated and so there is much more of a necessity to store your food and make the most of whatever is in season. Creating a central place in Nundle village to share these skills, whether it was in pickling, making jam or relish, seemed like an opportunity just waiting to be realised. Rachel: It’s been tricky to navigate the endless red tape when working with a government body (the regional council), but individual staff members linked to Nundle itself have been very supportive. Fear of judgment is also a challenge for a new project in a small community. Our little village has many different community groups which all have a critical role to play to keep our community a healthy and productive one. The challenge is to maintain the relationships between all of these groups and to ensure that everyone is feeling empowered by growth rather than feeling threatened by change. In the current climate where the world has gone a little bit mad with the thirst for money and power, it seems ever more important that little communities such as ours continue to work together and build strength and resilience. As permaculture teaches, humans are just one small part of an entire ecosystem and I think we often forget that. Rachel: So many connections have grown out of our opening event and the garden itself – and we are full of excitement for the future. Our little garden may be small but we are cultivating change on a much larger scale. I like to imagine that, just like the mycelium that lives, breathes, and weaves its tiny threads through the soil beneath our feet, this garden is sending out tendrils of love and hope for a better future. Rachel: We’d love to express our gratitude to Milkwood for your inspiration to become active participants in the quest to live more at one with our planet. Megan (a member of our Landcare Group) and I, completed the Permaculture Living course last year and it was absolutely transformative and definitely a catalyst for growth and change. Thanks for your positive leadership in the world of permaculture, for reminding us to slow down, to cherish all that nature provides and to find joy in the equally simple and invigorating act of gardening. Aw, aren’t they just the loveliest? If you’d like to follow this ace little group as they continue to grow this project, check out the Nundle Community Garden on Instagram.

Time to share our new project! After years of journeying through family farms, rooftop community gardens, and a lot of rental permaculture… we’re finally putting down some roots. On a little patch of earth with a house on top, which has been christened Quoll Hollow by the kid (I veto-ed Dragons Rest, and various other options)… in southern lutruwita Tasmania. As you can imagine, we have Big Plans to make this patch of earth an amazing backyard permaculture system, that will nourish our family and friends and grow many years of goodness. So take this as an introduction, if you will, to the where and why. We’d love you to join us on this new journey – and I can’t wait to tell you EVERY detail – but I’m going to try and start at the beginning. Here goes. So after + years of planting gardens and fruit trees on family farms, community rooftops, rentals, back steps and other people’s farms, we’ve washed up on melukerdee country, near the town of Cygnet, in southern lutruwita Tasmania. So… we’d been dreaming of Tasmania for… a long time. In our minds, it was full of green rolling hills, reliable rainfall, and affordable housing – all of which sounded pretty ace. It took us quite a few years to make our way down here, mostly because of the big, beautiful opportunity to live at Melliodora with David Holmgren and Su Dennett for three years – formative years indeed! So much learned, and so grateful. But, like lots of folks, the pull for housing security was strong. We wanted to put down roots, and feel like we could really stay somewhere. And so Tasmania seemed like the main option, to us. Slight confession though – we didn’t really look at anywhere else IN Tasmania, other than where we are. Yes, looking around would have been prudent. But we had friends in this valley, there was an awesome ‘un-schooling school’ up the hill for our yo Ashar, and house prices were… well, they were less than the mainland, at least. Plus, it was the chance to live near saltwater and seaweed again, in a valley with good enough soil to grow all the things. And so that was that. The main research on Tasmania that I did before moving here was reading Tasmanian Aborigines by Lyndall Ryan, which shifted my perspective on Tasmania greatly, and permanently. Once we arrived in this area, we got learning about the melukerdee people, who have stewarded this country for ,+ years, and sought out the South East Tasmanian Aboriginal Corporation (SETAC) so we could start to pay the rent. We’re still actively learning about the history of the Cygnet area, but it had been a swan nursery since forever, and a protected valley that ran down to an estuary full of shellfish. In the last + years, it’s been ‘apple country’ with orchards on every slope. In the last  years, most of the orchards have been cleared (though their legacy of heavy metals from pesticides remains – in many paddocks, and in the mud of the estuary also) and this area has become… many other things. Including our home. After we arrived, we found a house-sit for  months, and then the plan was to rent for a few years until we had a house deposit saved up. But a combination of scarce rentals in the area, and the looming of COVID – which arrived on the scene  months after we moved to Tasmania, meant that we decided to fast-forward our plans, and try really hard to buy a place as soon as we could. I think the aftermath of the Black Summer / fires, which we were in, made us a combination of slightly unhinged and utterly determined to sort out homeownership, asap. And we were privileged enough to be able to make that happen, thanks to the local community bank saying yes, you can have a loan (it was the early days of COVID and no-one was seeking home loans for a weird little pocket there, lucky for us). Now we needed to find a suitable patch. So – here’s what we wanted our place to be, before we started… “It’s a gentle sloping wonderland of veggies and berries and fruit and flowers – out the back there’s a big covered deck spilling down into the garden – the firepit is a focal point and there’s hidden nut groves and violets and trickling water and small birds everywhere. Above the house there’s beehives and more productive trees and water tanks and stacks of firewood and the washing ALWAYS dries in a day because the line is in just the right spot. There’s small and bigger sheds and studios and all sorts of projects happening, or you can just stretch out by the fire circle and do absolutely nothing, too. It’s a place that warms the heart with gladness and feeds our family and community in all sorts of ways. It’s a sheltered valley unto itself.“ So to be clear (because we’ve been asked this a lot, lately) we came here NOT looking for a farm. After years of stewarding other folks’ properties, we’ve come to a place where all we want is a cracking backyard growing system, and that’s it. We want to have extra energy to point outwards, into our community. And we’ve lived on enough farm-ish sized places to know how much work they take. Farms are excellent! But we didn’t want one. What we did want was: So prettymuch immediately, a place that matched most of our criteria, on the one street Nick had identified as ‘the best bit’ of the valley, because of its northerly aspect, came up for sale. So we jumped on it. Really, it was more about the aspect and slope of the land than the house, but we’ve come to love the house, in its way, also. The place we found has: Huzzah! We now had a house. We were keen to move in, and keen to get gardening. There were a few things we wanted to fix and do before we moved in, but because of our rental lease, and all the uncertainty of COVID, we decided to do what we could in  weeks, and leave everything else for later (much later, probably). I’ll do another post about all the bits we did to the house so far, but our primary aim in this short time frame was to increase the house’s energy efficiency as much as we could, increase our water and heating resilience, increase our resilience to bushfires, and remove as many plastics as we could, within reason. The budget was limited, so we just did what we could. We managed to: There’s a lot more we’d like to do with the house, but it will have to wait until we’ve established our food growing systems, and saved up a bit. Like any not-new house, it’s all very chicken and egg – we want to install water tanks and solar, but first needs to come re-doing the leaky roof and the rusted-through gutters… we’ll get there. The to-do list includes: Ok – that’s enough about you, little house! You keep us warm and dry and for that we are super thankful. But we’re really here for the garden. Oooh it’s nearly design time! Here is a rough list of what we brainstormed as a family as Essential for the outside areas. Annual veggie production – we love growing veg, and there ain’t nothing better than salad and carrots from outside your back door. Perennial food production – both veggies and other food, too. Much more resilient (in some ways) than annual veg to harsh seasons, and definitely part of the picture. Small forest garden – because peaches! And all the other delicious fruits we can grow down here. With a happy and diverse understorey of herbs and flowers, to make life better. Berries! Lots – ok so this is mostly me (Kirsten) but berries are my favourite thing ever. They also don’t translate terribly well to rental gardens, so I’ve got some serious catching up to do. Within reason, i shall have all the berries. Ok some of them. But heaps! And enough to share, too. Large chicken run – for a goodly supply of eggs, chickens, and help with nutrient cycling for the rest of the system. Also chickens are hilarious. I never want to be without them again. Outdoor summer kitchen + firepit – the best way to enjoy your garden, in my opinion, is roasting just-picked garden produce over your firepit, while the sun goes down, your bones ache from the wheelbarrow and your friend passes you a home-made cider. Yes please! I’m also a big fan of outdoor processing of preserves and such, so a summer kitchen must be added to this area also. Possibly goats (later, but designed for) – we want the option of adding milking goats to our system, but not in phase , because goats are a lot of work. Love them, but there you have it. I do want the option of adding them, though, and so this needs to be accounted for in how we set things up. Grass area for kids and dogs to do their thing (to be co-opted by goats, later) – important to plan for! Cricket in the corn patch is not desirable. And if you’re going to do backflips, don’t do them in the berries, please. Go over to your nice big patch of grass, and everyone will be happy. Just watch out for the grazing goat. Possum proofing – because we like our berries ripe, and our pea shoots un-eaten. Possums are our main pest pressure down here – there is some bird pressure, but there’s a lot of better things in this valley to chew on than our little patch. Beehives – we miss you, bees! Can’t wait to steward you again. Aiming for  warre hives up the front, above the house so you can all fly into the valley easily and bring home the goodness Structures – a shed, a glasshouse, a tiny writing studio… yep, lots of desires here. Slowly, slowly… Our main consideration when planning this system has been How Much is Too Much. Now – before you shout joyfully ‘never too much!’ … can I say that yes, I thought that too, once. But after years of digging and picking and processing All The Things, I now think that there is a good amount of veggie beds, and there is also a point at which one can have Too Many. Likewise with fruit trees. Our energy is not infinite, nor is my weeding and tending time, nor are our evenings, for processing s of kilos of produce. Also, I like having a life that is not JUST about processing produce, from December until May, each year. So – on behalf of my dear departed Nana, who stirred endless pots of jams till her hands curled into claws and she fell asleep where she stood – I’m claiming some balance. I love growing food, and storing it. Love, love, love it. But I also like life beyond the garden. And so designing for ‘just enough’ (which still allows for enough to share) will be important. Once we had done our family visioning, and our wish list, it was time to get designing. For this important part of the process, we decided to work with our dear friend and ace permaculture designer Hannah of GoodLife Permaculture, rather than do the whole thing ourselves. Why not just do it ourselves? Because we wanted an outside eye of someone we trusted and who knew a LOT about designing permaculture backyards for southern Tasmania. Also, to speak plainly, we both have a Lot Of Opinions, and we like being married – so getting an ace expert designer to help with this bit really freed us up to focus on Milkwood AND not have  months of possibly-heated ‘discussions’ about what should go where, and why. Thank you Hannah, we love you! The process went something like this: Hannah sent us a bunch of great design questions about our motivations and dreams for the place, as well as anything specific that we wanted. Once we sent our answers back, along with a sketch of what we’d been thinking so far, she came to our place and did a bunch of sketching, thinking, measuring and chatting. Then, she went away for a few months and came back with an amazing design draft that incorporated everything we wanted. There were a few back-and-forth tweaks, and then she came back with a final design. A note that we made a key decision with this backyard design to dedicate an amount of energy and inputs (within budget) into establishing things at the start, to ensure future energy inputs would be minimal. So – we decided to go with earthworks, earthmoving machines (and their attendant fossil fuels) and big rock walls to create flat spaces, rather than hand-terracing or hand-terraforming the site slowly, slowly, over a number of years, using our backs and our time as the main energy input for this part. This was a conscious decision, and we hope that these once-in-a-lifetime earthworks will benefit our family and whoever stewards this patch next, for many decades of abundance. Here’s Hannah’s final design – there’s LOTS of info to absorb. Enjoy. If you’d like to see the details, here’s a larger version of the final design. Once the design was done, the next step was to clear the site of unwanted elements, and then book in Tim the amazing earthmover/artist, who would come to terra-form our backyard into a series of super-usable flat spaces, separated by rock walls. Can’t wait to share this next part of the process with you. {EDIT} – Here’s the next steps!

Always wanted to try growing mushrooms at your place – delicious and medicinal varieties – using sustainable, low-waste techniques? Download this free ‘getting started’ guide first! If you’ve never grown mushrooms before, the whole process can seem deeply mystifying. What equipment do you need? How long does it take? Do they go outside in the veggie patch, or do you need a dark cave? Yet once you have the basic skills and principles, you can easily grow your favourite mushrooms at your place – promise! So – in this guide, we answer all of those questions, so you understand the overall process and are ready to dive further into your mushroom growing journey. Best of all, we’re going to show you our low-waste approach, honed over YEARS of growing mushrooms at our place. Did you know most commercial mushroom cultivators rely heavily on disposable, single-use plastics? By contrast, mushroom growing at home can be practically zero waste. You can make use of pre-loved and repurposed materials, and reuse over them and over again. What a win! We’ve been growing mushrooms since about , and over that time we’ve honed our knowledge, skills, techniques and processes over thousands of grows. We have eaten a lot of home-grown mushrooms, read a lot of books and talked to many experts. We have pioneered a bunch of low-waste, low-cost techniques that are deeply excellent for home-growing. And we shared this knowledge with ,+ students face-to-face, before creating our online Home Mushroom Cultivation course. Thing is, different mushroom species need different things in order to thrive. So in our free guide, to give you an idea of what’s involved for different types of mushrooms, we take a look at the overall basics of three very different approaches to growing mushrooms: We focus on teaching how to grow mushrooms successfully with a low-waste, permaculture approach – which means more mushrooms for you, and better outcomes for our planet, too. Yes, that’s right – growing your own mushrooms is a wonderful way to turn ALL the permaculture principles into real-life lived experiences. You can easily Obtain a Yield of delicious mushrooms while Producing No Waste. When you find yourself incubating mushrooms under your bed, or fruiting them in your bathroom, or down the shady side of your house where nothing else ever grows, you will discover that mushrooms really are the poster-child of Using Edges and Valuing the Margins. And, one of our favourite things about growing mushrooms is the way they invite you to Observe and Interact: to tune into your home, notice the changing seasons, discover the shifting patterns of light and temperature, your climate, and the beautiful outdoors. It’s an absolute delight. By the way, you can learn more about the  permaculture principles over here, if you like. Ready to get your head around the steps required to start growing at your place?     ;Milkwood

Harvesting rainwater is an excellent strategy to increase your household’s resilience, and it’s available to (nearly) everyone. Got a sky, that rains sometimes? Well, you can begin! Let’s get harvesting. There’s so many simple hacks and systems you can set up at your place, even if you’re renting, to catch, store and use rainwater to make life more abundant, in all sorts of ways. We know all this for sure because we have been designing rainwater harvesting systems and solutions – in rental backyards, community rooftop gardens, and at the farm scale too, for over  years now. And so we’ve learned a lot about what works in different places, on different budgets – whether you’re harvesting rainwater to drink, to store for later, or to divert to plantings around your home. So here’s a recording of our ‘Rainwater Harvesting for Beginners’ mini workshop… full of ways that you can use rainwater harvesting techniques to make your place more resilient, reduce bushfire risk, increase abundance AND better support your local watershed and ecosystem, too. This workshop is based on a lesson from our acclaimed Permaculture Living online course, which we welcome you to check out. By the end of this workshop replay, you’ll be brimming with ideas to get started with harvesting rainwater at your place, and making your space somewhere that you’ll truly love to live in. Alrighty – let’s get planning! Here’s a resource bank to get you started – some of our favourite books, calculators, websites, guides and inspirations for getting started with rainwater harvesting at your place… Whew! So many inspiring resources. Well, that’s enough to get you started… if you have any more suggestions for great resources, please comment below, and we will add them? If you have any questions about the workshop, please ask away in the comments below, and we can help you out , or point you in the right direction. And if you’d like to hear about our next mini-workshop and other great free trainings, guides and other things, please join us on the Milkwood community newsletter, and we’ll let you know.

"Here’s an ace new resource to help wrap your head around the principles of permaculture –  illustrated designs created by Mirranda Burton, an artist who took part in our online Permaculture Living course this year, and sketched along as she went! Mirranda lives on Wurundjeri country (Melbourne Australia) and says drawing helps her grasp ideas in a more dimensional way. Creating graphic study notes while studying Permaculture Living was a method of “doodling my way into a way of being”, Mirranda says, which sounds very good indeed. She hopes her illustrations will help visual learners understand that meaty question – ‘what is permaculture’, as well as themes within the  permaculture principles. And so – she’s kindly allowed us to share all of her designs here. Thanks, Mirranda! Let’s sit down for a quick chat with Mirranda – and then take a look at each of her  weeks of graphic study notes. After training in fine arts and multimedia design, I’ve explored the disciplines of printmaking, illustration, independent and commercial animation, and graphic story telling. In recent years I have been working as an educator and a graphic novelist, with my second book set for release in August . I have had some experience, in the sense that many of the practices within permaculture were introduced to me as a kid. I grew up in a very non-materialistic household with limited resources, and my mother was, (and still is) a grassroots environmental activist. We never actually used the word ‘permaculture’, so having now studied the system, I see how some of my practical habits and philosophies can become part of a more wholistic way of living. Signing up to Milkwood’s Permaculture Living course was my partner’s idea. I was wrapping up a long and challenging chapter of my life, and he imagined it to be an ideal catalyst for transition. As soon as the first Permaculture Living module kicked off, an anchor was cast in my life. I’d never known such a delight in weeds and hawthorn berries before, and as each week brought new discoveries, I realised I was acquiring new tools to adapt to an uncertain and rapidly changing world. I hadn’t previously realised the depth and breadth of permaculture as a living system, and my journey has far from ended. Inspiring, practical, community building and committed the the realisation of a better world; this course has clearly been made with love. While I have been a visual practitioner for a long time, I only became aware of graphic recording in the last three years. Normally a graphic recorder responds spontaneously to a talk or conference with visual notes and text, and the audience can view this in real time. I wanted to teach myself to synthesise information into simple graphics, and I saw the permaculture course as an opportunity to practise. It also helped me prepare for my first live graphic recording, which I performed at a recent environmental conference. This series of graphic notes merely scratches the surface of each module, as each class is a veritable portal to new directions for redesigning your life and the world. I created my graphic notes by drawing directly on the surface of my iPad with a stylus, and using the drawing software ‘Procreate’. I didn’t sketch while listening to the learning modules, as I was still gaining confidence. Instead, I drew spontaneously from my more comprehensive text notes, trying to hone my skills in compressing information and coming up with my own pictorial shorthand. Visualising concepts helps my memory retention, and brings dimensionality to ideas. In turn, these visual notes are helpful to others, as so many people are visual learners. I think the course has helped me create a more three-dimensional long-term vision for my life. I see more clearly how permaculture living elements work together, and the levels of resilience and harmony they can create. Realising our agency is a powerful thing, and permaculture principles do as much to confront dysfunctional and unsustainable models of living, as they bring joy, love, connection and lasting change. Alrighty, let’s take a look at each of the  graphic study notes Mirranda created during each week of her Permaculture Living course… Errrr, sorry but HOW GOOD ARE THESE? Big thanks to Mirranda for sharing these excellent resources with us. If you’d like to connect with Mirranda directly, check out her Instagram and website.

Grant Bailey was just  when a serious workplace accident in  dramatically changed his life. His spinal cord was so badly injured that Grant permanently lost the use of his left leg. In the  long months of recovery and rehabilitation that followed, Grant reevaluated almost every part of his life. Diagnosed with ‘incomplete paraplegia’, he was determined to make changes – including starting to grow even just a little of his own food. And so he did – all through the next decade. As he learned wheelchair basketball in Sydney. After he moved to Ngunnawal Country (Canberra) to train as a Paralympian rower. And when, in , he became the first person in the Asia Pacific to be fitted with an innovative C-Brace robotronic leg. In , Grant and his family moved to a three-acre property on melukerdee country in talune (Cygnet, Tasmania) – right near our Milkwood HQ! Here he set up an edible garden that we reckon you’ll want to know about… Because, with a few relatively simple design tweaks, Grant has ensured his garden is accessible for people of all abilities. He can tend his veggies easily while standing (wearing his C-Brace) or from his wheelchair, on the days he needs to use one. So let’s sit down with Grant (who also happens to be a student of our Milkwood Permaculture Living course) for a chat about his productive space, as well as some tips on how you can set up an all-abilities veggie garden at your place, too… My wife Lauren and I both grew up in the suburbs on the mainland (of Australia), and our family and friends thought we were mad when we decided to be a bit crazy and zip down Tasmania way to seek a different type of lifestyle. I’m glad we proved them wrong. We bought our three-acre property knowing nothing about fruit trees or how to manage the land. We’d grown a lot of veggies in all the places we lived, out in the garden and in raised beds, but not on this scale. The previous owner was a market gardener and sold seedlings, so the property is pretty well set up. We have  fruit trees across the farm too. It’s a beautiful place. After we moved in, I ended up doing a proper dedicated garden area with seven raised beds and wide pathways for ease of access, which makes it far easier to bring in a wheelchair, that kind of thing. Plus we have a polytunnel, which is about extending our growing time. In mid-autumn, we’ll still have a few tomatoes hanging on, even when the weather gets down to four degrees. We always grow our staples like lettuce, tomatoes, chillies, basil, silverbeet, garlic, all the brassicas, artichoke, asparagus, zucchinis, cucumbers, all types of beans, onions and beetroot. I guess we grow whatever is in session, plus something new each season that we haven’t grown before. Yes, it was based around my mobility now, but also the potential loss in the future – because as you get older, your body gets weaker. I’m pretty lucky, because the technology of the C-Brace will probably help me to walk as long as possible. I have a spinal cord injury and I’ve lost function mainly in my left leg. I was able to convince my insurance company that this C-Brace device, manufactured in Germany, would help a lot – so in , I was the first person in the Asia Pacific to get one. It changed everything. It works like a robotronic leg. It has in-built sensor technology and uses microprocessors to work out what’s going on, so the orthosis controls my walking movements as I take each step. The components sit on the outside of my leg – the first version was very chunky, about the size of the average person’s shoe, and it sat just above my knee. I wore that for about five years. Then they developed a new one that’s more water-resistant, and it’s about half the weight and a quarter of the size. I can fit in a pair of pants quite nicely now, which is great. But even now, if I get really sick, it affects my balance. And then it’s not particularly safe for me to be walking around. So I do have a wheelchair. It’s pretty dusty at the moment as I haven’t had to use it for awhile, but it’s there for those times when I’m dizzy or nauseous and can’t walk safely. All the pathways are about a metre wide. This means you can accommodate a wheelchair easily. Or, if you’re walking, you can have someone next to you. I walk a bit like a penguin, so it’s good to have that extra space. In terms of the materials, the carbon footprint of concrete is pretty massive, but maintaining dirt or gravel is a lot of effort. I want to spend time growing food for my family, so we decided the best choice was concrete with a colourant in it, so it looks like it’s part of the natural environment. We’re in a heavy frost zone so slippery ice can form on pathways if they don’t have a textured finish. We made the concrete rough-textured to avoid this, and to give a bit more traction. A non-slip surface is crucial. Yeah, one winter we had a massive crazy storm that blew a trampoline into our -metre long polytunnel and took the whole thing out. So I rebuilt it, reduced it by half, repurposed all the materials and converted it so it’s easier to get in with my wheelbarrow. My wheelchair is roughly the same width as the wheelbarrow, so that worked well – I just made the paths a little wider to allow for turning and such things. I then made two long garden beds on both sides, about mm by m long, and then a big open area about mm wide, so I can turn around with the wheelchair. That was pretty important to have too. I also made a ramp on one side so I could easily roll in with the wheelbarrow or my wheelchair – you open the door and wheel right in. I dug the main support into the ground and covered it with soil so it’s completely level. Having a level entry to places is really important – a small step or lip can be a really annoying barrier for accessibility. Outside of the polytunnel, we have seven raised garden beds. Most of them are the standard mm high – they’re powder-coated corrugated galvanised steel beds that we picked up secondhand. Then we’ve got another raised bed that is mm off the ground, which is designed to be a sitting bed, for me to access from my wheelchair. We also have a couple of garden beds that are only mm high. And things we grow direct in the ground, like broad beans and garlic, we’ve put right on the edge of the path so access is really easy. One of the things we had to work around was filling these raised garden beds without spending a huge amount of money. So we practiced the hugelkultur method – putting rotting tree limbs on the bottom, followed by food scraps and manure to really get the microorganisms and fungi going crazy, and then mm of soil on top of that. It’s like a natural forest system – the water in the wood as it’s rotting down acts like a bit of a sponge, so it helps to retain moisture. And as the wood breaks down very slowly, the soil layer goes down so you can add new material to the bed as you’re planting new veggies – we add compost and chicken manure. The veggies just love it. After my accident and being in hospital, I had a massive life change. I had that  months to reevaluate my life. Most people don’t get that opportunity because they’re so busy with everything. I needed to do something different and I decided I wanted to grow some food. Now we produce a lot of the food our family of four eats. In spring and summer it’s probably about %, although in winter it’s a different story. Being in the garden is so therapeutic for me. I feel that being connected to the land and the food we eat not only brings me so much joy, but also supports my mental health in a wonderful way. Being able to nurture and be connected to our food systems and ecosystems brings me back to a place of clarity and calm. I think everyone should do a bit of gardening, if they can.

Whether you’re heading into winter or summer in your part of the world, now could well be the perfect time to consider fruit tree pruning at your place. Pruning at just the right moment can help ensure a bigger and better fruit harvest, can make accessing your fruit yield easier in coming months (no more ladders to reach the top of ginormous trees) and can lead to healthier and more beautiful trees, and more resilience for you. It’s part science, part feeling and in-the-moment decision-making – and a totally accessible skill for even the beginners. A willingness to read, learn, observe and read some moreis essential, as well as learning a little bit about how fruit trees grow. But with just a few tools and a little conviction, it is possible to prune with confidence, and take excellent care of your dear fruit tree friends – year in, year out. So – here we have a fruit tree pruning guide for you to consult and consider, and get you all skilled up and ready to go Because pruning fruit trees is easy once you know how, but a foundational understanding is important. So let’s get you there, quick smart. First up – the basics. Pruning involves the use of secateurs, loppers or pruning saws to remove unwanted plant material, in order to allow the fruit tree to continue to produce fruit in a way that’s healthy for the tree, and accessible to harvest. If you’re into foraging wild fruit and berries, you’ll likely have noticed that many wild fruit trees in our suburbs and country towns are never pruned or cared for – yet often produce vast quantities of fruit and flowers. So – why do we prune? Well, the expectations we place on berries and fruit trees for our homes or commercial orchards are often very different to the expectations we have of wild plants. For example – no matter what a wild tree looks like, no matter how poorly shaped or damaged or how small the fruit or how often it fruits, we are often so excited to find wild fruit that all other cares are forgotten. But with fruit trees we have purchased and planted ourselves, those expectations often change. Therefore we prune to achieve one or more of the following: It’s worth noting – not all approaches to pruning are coming from a DIY, home-harvest perspective. Commercial orchardists often prune trees heavily and create very wide open canopies, not only to access fruit but also to make chemical spraying easier – they try to ensure all foliage has made contact with sprays. It’s important to understand that in a permaculture setting, where chemical sprays are not used, trees are best shaped to reflect the climate and fruit harvest needs. In some contexts, that may mean less pruning, to prevent the plant being sunburnt (due to not enough foliage), or even pruning hashly to reduce the crop (so your little household isn’t overwhelmed with kg of apples at once). Plants direct sugars produced during photosynthesis to different parts of the plant. Sugars are transported to increase plant height and assist with fruit set. When pruning, you’re aiming to inform and assist this process. For example if fruit is the most important outcome for the next year (as opposed to fruit tree growth, perhaps), then pruning is carried out to reduce tree height – in favour of fruit set and fruit accessibility.  Pruning aims to maintain a balance between the number of fruit buds that develop and the amount of growth created by the tree – because this is growth which will produce fruit buds in the future. And because your fruit tree is a perennial plant, you want to think about future harvests as you prune for this year’s harvest. Balance in all things…  OK – so now let’s get into some of the more technical details. Stone fruits such as plums, cherries, peaches and apricots are best pruned in summer. (Stone fruits are identified by the distinctive single stone at the centre of the fruit.) This is because these fruit trees, if pruned in winter, are very susceptible to a disease called Cytospora canker. This fungal disease attacks pruning cuts made in cold weather. So prune these trees in warm weather to give the wound sufficient healing time before deep winter. Pome fruits such as apples, pears, quince, medlar, are generally pruned when plants are dormant in winter. (Pome means apple in French.) Pomme fruits aren’t susceptible to Cytospora canker, so they’ll cope fine with pruning in cold weather. Pruning in winter is a good idea because your trees will have completely finished growing, are dormant and any pruning done then will produce lush new growth in spring.  A further note on summer pruning… All fruit trees can be pruned in summer, too – but note that pruning while the tree is still actively growing will limit its growth. So, if you’re trying to reduce the size of a tree, summer pruning could be the way to go. Understanding a tree’s growing features (morphology) helps you to really “see” your fruit tree and to make informed pruning cuts. It is up to you to decide which stems will become your leaders. You can choose just one leader going directly up and at the centre of the tree (known as a central leader). Or you can choose multiple leaders – perhaps three, five or even . The choice will be based on the space you have and what you plan to do with the tree. Is the main goal of the fruit tree to provide a harvest and to be able to access that harvest super efficiently? Or do you want a harvest but also a beautiful tree(s) that will provide shade and act as a feature in your orchard or garden? Some commercial orchards produce fruit on one central leader. Others have two leaders that have been pruned to create a very wide V-shape. Others produce a vase shape by removing the central leader and keeping multiple laterals in a wide open, wine glass frame. Again, be cautious about leaning too heavily on the methods of commercial growers, who often have chemical sprays to consider. Instead, if your fruit trees have been planted to give you beauty, shade, and fruit, don’t prune too heavily. Your aim will be to reduce growth but not to the point where the tree canopy (the upper branches and leaves that provide shade) is totally compromised by a commercial orchard style V or Vase. Your climate will also greatly influence your decisions. In dry hot summers, you may not want a wide open fruit tree that lets lots of light in, as it may make the tree and fruit more susceptible to sunburn. But in a very humid, low-wind environment – you will want to open the tree up to reduce fungal diseases. Apical dominance is the effect the tallest upright stem has on the potential for lateral stems below it to grow. Remember – we want lateral stems to grow because these branches bear the most amount of fruit.  A tree trunk has many points of potential growth along it below the tallest upright (apical) stem. Many of these points are invisible, but appear the moment apical dominance is removed. So, you may choose to reduce apical dominance by either: Whichever you choose, reducing apical dominance can help ensure more fruit yield lower down on the tree – where it’s easier to reach. First we must find out if our fruit tree is spur-bearing or tip-bearing. One of the key features that will help you decide where to cut when pruning fruit trees is the size and shape of buds. If you can, have a go at determining if the bud you see is a: Shooting bud: a thin flattish bud that will produce leaves and stem.  Fat fruit bud: a bud that looks fatter and rounder and sometimes fluffy, than a shooting bud and will produce a flower and therefore fruit (if pollinated). Fruiting spur (also known as spur-bearer): a short stocky shoot close to leaders, that produces fruit and is spaced very closely to the next short stocky shoot. The internode (the space between two shoots) is very short as well. Fruiting spurs occur on apples, pears, cherry, pomegranate and plums. If you’re hoping your pruning efforts will result in more fruit, try not to lop off too many fat fruit buds or fruiting spurs. Or, if you’re hoping to encourage your tree to grow into a different and more accessible shape, consider the direction shooting buds are pointing and cut accordingly. Watch the video below for a really good overview of how to identify each different type of bud – Short answer – yes they will. But to make harvesting easier in the long term, you will most likely want to prune your fruit trees every year. We’ve gone through a lot of theory here, so let’s walk through an example of how you might approach the pruning of a new baby apple tree – if you purchased it as a bare-rooted tree from a nursery. We’ll imagine the top priority for pruning is ‘easy access to fruit’. And let’s note that, generally speaking, apples produce fruit in their second or third year of growth. To accurately prune you must know if your apple variety is a spur-bearer or tip-bearer. This knowledge is used when pruning your new apple tree from its third year – or when pruning any mature apple tree. Most apple varieties are spur-bearers – they produce trees with a tidy compact appearance and produce lots of spurs on wood two years and older. Other varieties however produce fruit in clusters near or at the tip – and thus are known as tip-bearers. Tip bearers produce very few fruiting spurs, are more sparse in appearance and have fewer spurs. So, if you’re purchasing a new bare-rooted baby tree, ask which type it is. Or, if you’re pruning a mature tree, look for spurs before pruning (they’re more visible on apple trees at two years or older). If you can’t spot any, your variety is most likely a tip-bearer. When purchasing a bare-rooted apple tree, the nursery may cut the leaders back by two-thirds when you buy the tree, or they may not. Ask them if you are not sure. If the tree was pruned by the nursery, you will receive a tree with very short branches and with only two to three main stems that form the ‘framework’ of the tree. The cuts will have been made to a bud facing directly upwards (ideally) and outwards from the tree. If the tree you have bought has very long skinny stems, then it is up to you to cut back the stems by two-thirds and to a bud pointing upwards and outwards. But why? Let’s discuss that a bit later. In spring, these apple trees will produce only leaves – because apple trees do not produce fruit on the first year’s growth. By Year , the aim is to keep building the framework of the tree, to strengthen stems by cutting them shorter and giving them more time to thicken up before they are expected to bear fruit, and to keep fruit-bearing parts as close as possible to the leaders that form the framework. To achieve this, choose about seven to  lateral branches and cut them back to half their length. These  laterals will form the new ‘framework’. Other shoots, such as leaders and sublaterals should be pruned back to about five buds. Then, to clear the frame and stem clutter, remove any other shoots that overlap back to the stem. Year  is that pivotal moment in which you need to know whether your apple tree is a spur-bearer or a winter-tip bearer – and prune accordingly. So, if you have a spur-bearing variety – prune branch leaders by a quarter of the previous year’s growth. Prune strong laterals – those you want to keep because they don’t look spindly, skinny and weak – back to six buds. But prune weak laterals – those that you want to thicken up – back to three buds. Also remove any laterals that cross over other branches – cut them back flush to the stem. If you have a tip-bearing variety – prune the branch leaders by a quarter, as you would with tip-bearing apple trees – but DON’T prune the laterals. The tips of the laterals is where most of the fruit will set so removing them would cut off next season’s fruit. Remove only laterals that look very weak. In the first two years of the tree’s growth, we wanted to focus on shaping the tree, increasing it’s strength by allowing leaders to thicken and shortening the length of those leaders. If we don’t shorten the leaders and allow the second year’s growth to grow on unpruned first year leaders – then we have allowed the tree to grow taller than it needs to be for the purpose of fruit production. Then year three comes around with new growth – if that too goes unpruned, then the arms of the tree grow longer and longer, and soon enough the fruit will be beyond our reach. When a bare-rooted tree is first purchased in winter, the tree height won’t be well matched to its root size. This is because it will have been grown in a pot or closely planted in the field with little room for roots to expand. The tree will have been well watered and fed and ‘nursed’. Once out of its crib and planted, you will still care for it, but not quite so vigorously. It is at this time that you will make your first prune. With weak stems, we prune back harder to help that stem get thicker, so that it can better support future fruit weight. We cut it back to three buds to give the tree three chances to form a new vegetative shoot, a shoot that produces a leaf followed by a stem. If the first and second bud fail to produce a new shoot, then the third bud is bound to succeed. For stems that are thick and therefore structurally sound, we prune back less hard, to six buds. That way we have six buds that can produce potential laterals – and it is on laterals that fruit is produced. Every season the tree puts on new growth and then comes to a stop. At the stop the tree develops a terminal bud, and a bulging line. You can use this to tell the age of your tree. Run your hand along the central leader and up and up until you can feel a raised textured surface that circles the stem. This is where growth has stopped and the next year’s growth has occurred. Each time you find a bulge – it represents a year’s growth. Fruit trees start to produce fruit in their second or third year (if dwarf varieties) or any time after those first initial years. They don’t produce fruit in the first year. Some fruit trees also then produce fruit only on new-season growth. Hence before pruning any fruit tree find out: Only though knowing this can you prune in an informed way. The apple tree example was given to help with the overall understanding of the thinking that underpins pruning. But fruit trees all have different details that change the chapters in the story. Hence, find out the particulars of the fruit tree you are pruning. At the end of this article we provide a list of questions you need to ask and answer (through research: take a look through a good book or ask google), to help you find answers that specifically relate to the fruit tree you are pruning. Your overall aim is to create large angles on laterals. Large angles are better at supporting fruit weight and help open up the tree to reduce congestion. Therefore when making a cut, look for buds that are pointing up and away from the central leader, or leaders. This is the very easiest part of pruning. If a branch is damaged or dead then making a cut only requires the smallest amount of know how. The easiest way to check if a branch is dead is to scratch a very small area of the stem back with your nail. If that branch/stem is alive it: If it’s dead it will be hard to scratch the surface, because it has dried and become very woody and you will not see a layer of lush green underneath. In this case, cut the stem right back. Place your secateurs with the narrow part of the blade closest to the base of the cut. Cut on a slight angle – not a large angle or you will expose too much of open wound. Likewise, if you can see a visibly broken branch, cut the stem right back flush, just as you would with a dead branch. Pruning low growing branches (lower than m) allows you to access the tree more easily – although in some landscapes where rabbits are a problem, it may be best to leave them. When we clear the central leader of the lowest-growing branches in a rabbit-rich environment, come winter the rabbits will chew the bark on the central leader to access sugars just beneath the bark (phloem). This can kill the tree by reducing its access to this important winter food. Most fruit trees are grafted trees – excellent fruiting varieties grafted on the top of a rootstock known to grow vigorously and strongly. Sometimes, even if the graft is successful, shoots are sent up from the rootstock – these are called suckers. Cut these suckers off as close as possible to the central leader, to prevent them taking over or stealing nutrients. If you have fruit trees then you will need a few key pruning tools – or borrow them from a neighbour or your local tool library (if your area has one). Secateurs: use these only for small cuts. You will break them if you use them on bigger cuts, or you may damage the stem you are cutting if it is too large. Loppers: excellent for bigger stems, with long handles for extra grip and force. Pruning saw: for extra-large branches or difficult-to-access branches. Pruning knife: for cleaning bad cuts. These allow you to scrape back tree cuts that did not produce a clean crisp edge. So – you’ve bought your first bare-rooted fruit tree, or a fruit tree in a pot, or you have access to an established tree. Hooray. Before you start lopping away, you will benefit from considering the following: The answers to these questions will help ensure you make cuts that are just right for a bigger and better fruit harvest, healthier and more beautiful trees, and more resilience for you.

Tis the season to brine olives! Or salt them, if you prefer. Whether you’ve grown them yourself or foraged them from bird-sown trees, it’s late Autumn that you want to pick and cure them. There are many ways to cure olives, but the essential thing is that you extract the glucosides from them – the chemicals that make the olives very bitter when just picked. You can do this by curing them in water and changing it daily, or by brining them, or dry salting them, or salt and then smoke them… so many options! In fact, we’ve written quite a few ‘how to brine olives’ articles over the years – so we’ve decided to gather them all together here, alongside our latest updated methods, based on + years of olive-ing. So – below is a few articles that we’ve written over the years, brought together. There’s even a video down the bottom of Nick brining olives in a caravan in Mudgee in , if you’re really keen. But first up, let’s start with the olive curing method we use year in, year out – it’s an easy water stage, and then a brine stage. And the result is a super tasty olive, no matter if you’re doing a  litre bucketfull, or just one small jar. enjoy x Okay so after a LOT of years of experimenting with brining, changing water, brining again, and so on – this is our settled method for brining olives that is low on hassle and high on success and taste. This method is a combo of fresh water and brining – it produces an excellent edible olive a few months after harvest (the exact time it takes will depend on your variety). If you are super short on time, you can cheat with the ‘just brine them’ method by heading straight to the brining stage below this bit. Straight-up brining is fine, but will take a bit longer before the olives are ready AND they may have a more astringent taste. In this first stage, fresh water is used to leach out some of the glucosides (the chemicals that make the olives very bitter when just picked) before you set the olives to brine. This stage results in a sweeter (or less astringent) eating olive at the end of the brining process. Extra-recommended for foraged or wild olives, that may have more glucosides in them. There’s lots of ways you can do this stage, but here’s what we do – for a balance between getting the benefits of the water stage, but also minimal hassle, and minimal water use. Find yourself a cooler or chilly bin with an external drain on it. Or a drum with a tap will do fine also. Cover the inner end of the drain with a little bit of mesh, so olives can’t get stuck in it. Then, set up your vessel somewhere it can be easily drained by putting a bucket under the outlet – on a rock wall, an outside chair, or wherever suits you. Then, add your just-picked olives to your vessel, and fill up the container with clean water. Rainwater is best, but use what you have. Cover the vessel and leave for  days – set yourself a reminder or write it on your calendar. After two days, drain off the water, use it on your garden, re-plug the outlet and fill up with clean water once more. Set another reminder, and then do the drain/refill sequence again. Set another reminder. Try and repeat this process for  days total. Longer is fine too, if you like (up to about a month) and a shorter period of time is still better than not doing it at all. If you forget about your olives for an extra day or two, fear not – your olives will be fine. Carry on until it’s  weeks later, or you need to move on with your life. Now, it’s time to brine. Once you’ve done the next stage you can store and forget about your olives for a few months, until it’s time to eat them. So you might jump straight to this part once you have your olives (if so, wash your olives first) OR you might proceed here from the fresh-water stage above. Either way – yay it’s brine time! First things first – sort out your storage container that you’re going to brine in. This might be a glass jar, or a food-grade plastic bucket with a lid. Either is fine, use what you have. Ok here we go – % brine time! This is dead simple. Use a good, non-iodised rock or sea salt. We used Himalayan rock salt because we have a great drum of it in our pantry, but use whatever you can get that’s straight-up salt, without caking agents. Note that our previous method used an egg – based on old-school advice, where you use the egg as a barometer to approximate a % brine – if the egg floats, your water is sufficiently salty. If it sinks, add more salt. We don’t use this method anymore! We now weigh the salt. But if you’re in a pinch, you can try the egg method. So – firstly decide on your volume of water, based on the vessel that you’re brining your olives in. You might decide to make one litre of brine, or , or  litres. That’s up to you. A very general rule of thumb would be to make up / the capacity of your container. Let’s say we’re using a  litre bucket to brine our excellent olive harvest. Therefore, you’re going to need about  litres of % brine. To make  litres of % brine, mix  litres of water (preferably non-chlorinated, if you can manage that) and g of salt together, to make a : ratio of salt to water – and that’s your % brine. Again – it’s all about mixing % salt by weight with the amount of water you estimate that you’ll need. So g of salt for  litre of water, g of salt for  litres of water, and so on – you get the idea. Tip: add the salt to a seperate container, boil / of the water you need, and pour that over the salt and stir to dissolve – and then add the other / of the cold water you need – you’ll end up with a lukewarm brine. Once you have your brine ready to go, pack your olives into your chosen vessel a clean jar (squish them down a bit, the tighter the better) and pour the cooled brine over the lot, until the olives are submerged. You can add a plate on top, or some other sort of mesh, to keep the olives submerged underneath the brine. Keep your olives somewhere dark and temperature stable. The bottom of a cupboard is fine. Like the proverbial piece of string, it depends – on the size of your olives, their ripeness, whether you did the water stage, and your desired saltiness. Taste your olives after they’ve been in the brine for  months, and get to know the taste of brining olives – you’ll soon get a feel for when they are as you like them.  months to a year is the spectrum. Once your olives are ready and you’ve drained the brine off them (which will now be very bitter) – it’s time to decide how you want your brined olives to roll. At this point you can proceed to store your olives in olive oil, or in : vinegar and water, or in a newly-made % brine in the cupboard for up to  months. Adding herbs and spices and lemon slices at this point is good. You can also smoke them! Or just eat them. This method is great for smaller olives (like these kalamatas above, that we scored from a tree on our last road trip). First up, make sure your olives are clean by giving them a quick wash, then drain. Then, take your clean jar and add a layer of good quality, non-iodised salt, then a layer of olives, and so on until the jar is full. The salt will trickle down between the olives, but as long as it’s all packed in there, that’s ok. Your salted olives will need a shake and a turn ever other day – the olives will soon exude liquid and the whole jar will become rather slushy. That’s good. Keep going. Start tasting your salted olives at around the  week mark, and when they taste right to you (saltier, and a bit shrunken, and slightly sweeter than brined olives), remove the olives from the salt. Once your olives are duly salted, you can eat them straight up, or store them in oil with herbs. They’re pretty darn yummy. This recipe is prettymuch what it sounds like BUT it’s no less amazing for that. Roasted olives is also an amazing way to eat ‘tasty but not that great-looking’ olives that have slightly bruised during the brining process, or were somewhat wonky to begin with. Your before-dinner snack plate will never be the same again. We learned this recipe from our dear friend Pearl, otherwise known as Genevieve and/or Eggplantia (mmm actually I’m not sure many folks call her eggplantia, but anyhoo)… who put out a big bowl of these roasted olives one evening at her farmhouse table, and changed my life. They are really good. Heat your oven to about ºc, fan-forced if you’ve got it. Tip drained olives onto a large baking tray, and add lemon slices, whole garlic cloves, and bits of rosemary. Make sure the olives aren’t over-packed, and not multiple layers deep – if you have a lot, use two trays. Slosh a bit of olive oil over the tray and mix everything around with your hands. Then, into the oven. Keep an eye on the tray and take it out at the  minute mark to agitate and give it a bit of a stir, then back in. After - minutes, remove and cool. The exact oven time you use will depend on size and variety of olives, but you want the olives a bit blistered on top, the lemon slices getting very toasty, and the garlic getting very roasty. Pour out the lot into a big bowl and serve to your loved ones, to snack on while warm. Also excellent cold, the next day. So there you have it! Happy picking + foraging… and if you’re up for a blast from the past, here’s a video of Nick showing how to cure olives in , from back in the days when we lived in a little caravan on a hillside, next door to an olive farm… More posts about how to store the season with preserves + ferments here.

Whether you have a small veggie patch or an expansive forest garden, adding green manures is a great way to replenish or build soils with minimal input. Thanks to nature and photosynthesis, sowing a ‘green manure’ mix of seeds will give your garden a crop of specialty plants that convert sunlight into biomass for your soils and add maximum nutrients, too – and all for free. The ‘manure’ part is a touch confusing though – there’s actually no animal poo involved. Instead, green manuring is all about sowing fast-growing, specific plants for a few weeks or months, then purposefully cutting down their juicy foliage and digging all that green matter back into the soil, where it decomposes – enhancing your garden’s soil balance, and eventually coming back around as food for us all. Green manures are grown from the seeds of fast-growing, specific, usually annual plants – often a legume combined with a specific grass (e.g. oats). And there’s different combinations of green manure seed mixes that suit different soils and climates. The effect of using green manures is a bit of magic for your garden – as the legumes (clover, lucerne, peas or beans) provide nitrogen, while the plants from the grass family provide plenty of organic matter. But a note of caution here – when I say ‘grass’, I’m referring to cereal grains such as barley, oats or sorghum, not problematic running grasses such as couch or kikuyu, like you find in your lawn. That is not a mistake you want to make! Planting green manures as part of your yearly rotation in parts of your veggie garden is an outstanding way to improve your veggie harvest and, as a bonus, break diseases cycles in your soil. Check out the list below of green manure benefits: If you have access to appropriate seeds, you can plant a green manure crop at any time of year (depending on your climate, obviously). But, as a starting point, summer or winter is the best time to plant a green manure crop – for digging in the following autumn or spring. In general, it’s a process that helps ensure you’re moving your soil forwards, not backwards. Regeneration is the name of the game here. You might decide to plant a green manure crop to: Our favourite way to plant a green manure crop is by broadcasting a good-quality seed mix over the patch we want to use it on, and then raking it all in so the birds can’t eat all the seeds. Sometimes we put a layer of shade cloth over the area to help with this, until everything’s germinated well. Shadecloth is also super useful to help contain soil moisture while your green manure crop germinates. You’ll then need to keep this bed moist, to ensure the seeds germinate. For a winter green manure, you’ll hopefully be blessed with rain – check the weather and aim to broadcast your seeds just before a rainy spell, and rake them in well. For drier weather, you may need to rig up a sprinkler, irrigation or remember to water daily, to keep the soil moist at least until germination happens. And then watch as a lush green carpet develops… Back in the days of our Milkwood Farm, sowing winter green manure crops was a crucial part of the organic vegetable growing regime – the green manures convert sunlight to nutrients, then get dug into the soil in early spring, and become food for us all. We used them extensively all over our Milkwood Farm for the years that we were there. In the more exposed parts of the farm, we used green manures when building earthworks such as dams and swales. (That led to mixed success, with some big disappointments due to incorrect species selection, drought, rabbits and the like.) But in the more protected micro-climates, like the Milkwood Farm forest garden or the market garden – where there was certainty of regular watering – green manures quickly became an essential part of the winter cycle of establishing and managing plantings. Adding winter biomass builds the soil’s water-holding capacity – a crucial thing to help safety steward summer annual food crops through the long, hot summers we experienced on the farm. Our favourite winter green manure seed mix – the one we used over and over, every year – is Green Harvest’s Cool Season Green Manure Kit. If you can’t access this fine Australian seed company’s seeds because of where you live, the species combo is: We’ve found it suitable for everything from the dry and hot conditions of Wiradjuri country near Mudgee (New South Wales) to the cooler climate of Djab Warrung country near Daylesford in Victoria, where we grew huge green manures while living at David Holmgren and Su Dennet’s Melliodora property. Summer green manures are great for shielding soil from the harsh sun, which helps prevent erosion and retain moisture in hot, dry conditions. These crops can also help reduce soil compaction, fix nitrogen and draw nutrients up to the surface from the subsoil. We currently use Southern Harvest’s Winter Green Manure mix, and it’s great. Other excellent options include Eden Seeds, and Diggers Club‘s various green manure mixes. Most countries in the world will have a similar product available. Please support your local open-pollinated seed companies whenever you can to source these seeds! If you’re operating on a small farm scale, it may make more sense to buy kg of each seed variety from your most ethical bulk seed supplier. The combination is: Note that both these seed mixes are suited to temperate and cool-temperate climates – if you’re in another climate, ask around (at your local nursery or community garden is a good place to start) and find out what a good green manure seed mix is for where you live… remember that that combination of a nitrogen-fixing legume and a cereal-like grass species is a great place to start. While planting green manures is pretty easy, a bit of future planning is also important here – you need to ensure you leave enough time for the green manure seed to germinate, grow and (maybe) begin to flower, to make the most of it. At that point, your green manure crop is ready to be chopped down or dug in, where it will start to decompose. (Tip: cut down the green manure crop before it starts fully flowering, otherwise it will start using nutrients from the soil.) Most seed providers give this timeframe as a guide: “Generally allow a minimum of  weeks for the green manure to grow and  weeks for it to decompose.” There’s a couple ways to chop and incorporate your green manure, depending on how big your patch is and how quickly you need to plant into it. On a small scale – say a veggie bed or two, you can simply hack it all down with a rice knife or similar, lay it down on the bed, wait a week for it to start decomposing a bit, and then plant seedlings directly into your lovely pre-mulched bed. Or, you can run a mower over the bed, making sure you empty the mushed green manure biomass back onto that bed, and maybe dig it in. Wait a few weeks, and plant into that.  In the past, we have also tarped beds after chopping-and-dropping our green manure crop (tarping is literally putting a plastic tarp on the bed and holding it down with a brick in each corner) and left it for  weeks before prepping for the next rotation. Tarping holds the moisture in, speeds up the decomposition of the green manure biomass, the worms in your soil have an absolute party, and four weeks later, that bed will be pretty much ready to either plant into (if you’re doing no-dig) or prep for your next crop. Back in our Milkwood Farm days, in our organic market garden, we would first mow the green manure (without a catcher, so the mushed plants ended up back on the bed), then roto-till it all into the soil, and then plant directly into that. For intensive vegetable production, turning the green manures into the soil is a great way to cycle nutrients quickly and create high production rates. Green manures are excellent for pumping your soil full of nutrients and life – so heavy feeding veggies will often produce excellently if planted next in the bed. For example, if you’ve had a spot where you’ve planted a green manure over winter, your spring tomatoes – which are heavy feeders and LOVE nutrients – will appreciate those extra nutrients in the soil. Crop rotation does take a bit of planning and forethought, but where we can, we like to do it this way – root veggie beds give way to fruiting plants, fruiting plants give way to leafy greens, leafy greens give way to legumes or green manures. And around the cycle it all goes. Yes, you can use aquatic plants for your green manures, too. Plants like azolla, for example, make an excellent aquatic green manure to top-dress or dig into your veggies beds. In some places, azolla (a type of very small-leaved, floating water fern) is a problematic plant when it establishes on dams, but that’s all the more reason to harvest and use it on your veggie beds. Instant green manure, if you will Until recently, azolla was used extensively in rice paddies across Vietnam, China and other parts of Asia, where it would cover the surface of the water in the paddy and out-compete weeds while the rice grew, and then fix nitrogen and contribute fertility to the soil, once the paddies were drained, later in the rice growing process. We have an article on azolla here, if you’re interested in learning more. You might have other water weeds, or fast growing water plants, that you can look into to do this same job, too. If you’re wanting to set up your own bathtub greywater system (we have a how-to guide on exactly how to do that over here), you’ll need to create a holding pond for water that has cycled through your worm farm and reed bed. It’s best to deposit that trickle of outgoing water into a large garden bed used for summer main crops like corn and wheat. Over winter, this damper area is an excellent spot to grow green manures. Movable greenhouses (on rails, skids or wheels) can be a great idea for the serious backyard grower or small-scale veggie farmer. To help ensure disease-free soil, you move the greenhouse to a new spot every now and then – or rotate between two patches – and use the cleansing powers of sunlight on the earth and photosynthesis in the forms of green manures to assist your garden’s nutrient cycling. Which ensures good food grown in healthy soil – all year round. More info on moveable greenhouses here. You can also use green manure mixes in fixed greenhouses to regenerate the soil just as well. So, scatter your clover seeds and some oats and vetch also – and let us know how you go?

"Imagine a colourfully painted urban laneway brimming with veggie plots and produce tables – where anyone can swing past to give or take whatever they wish, completely free of charge. This is the reality at Food is Free Ballarat, a bustling community space – created on public land without anyone’s permission – now visited by about  people each and every day. The project is the brainchild of Lou Ridsdale (who also happens to be a graduate of our Milkwood Permaculture Living course). As a freelance arts worker who’s experienced her fair share of food insecurity, Lou dreamed of a space where all types of folks could access nutritious, locally grown food, regardless of their income – or lack of it. In , she discovered the now-global Food is Free Project, founded by John VanDeusen Edwards in Texas in , and also this incredible TED Talk by Ron Finley from South Central Los Angeles. Soon after, Food is Free Ballarat was born to connect folks in the Australian city of Ballarat, at the junction of Wadawurrung and Djab Wurrung country. We chatted to Lou about her project’s enormous growth and incredible impact… I wanted to start as grassroots as possible – so I invited a small bunch of mates and held a backyard barbecue in October . We took over the laneway space beside my rental home, creating a small, instant guerrilla garden filled with food-producing plants. We painted it as brightly as we could with donated paints. I had no idea how long the space would last or if anyone would be into it, but I knew I harboured the skills and passion to pull it off. The day I set it up, I went inside and wrote a -point plan of what I wanted Food Is Free to become – and I’ve only ticked two of those off in the six years of operating! So, in truth – the real fun is yet to come. We ask only for fresh fruit, herbs and veggies, so we have all sorts hitting our share table baskets throughout the seasons. A huge factor of the Laneway is that it enables gardeners not to waste their food. Our catchphrase is: ‘No one is judged on what you bring or take, as long as you leave with a smile.’ But we also knew some people felt better about swapping useful items for food rather than just taking. I also wanted to lure in as many people as possible, even if they didn’t have a garden. So we allow people to leave things like recycled bottles and jars (for pickling, preserves and fermenting) and garden pot stands.  We also have points of exchange in our street library for cooking, gardening and self-sufficiency books, plus a seedling stand and a seeds toolbox. Practical things most households have. Plus people can drop off their kitchen scraps into our compost bins, or shredded paper, egg cartons and toilet roll holders in our Greens Recycle Depot. We also made it a priority to set up rainwater tanks. We have gone ahead in leaps and bounds since our first few years. We now enjoy up to  visitors daily. Yes! So four years ago, the City of Ballarat Community Development Team approached us saying they were so impressed with our work that they wanted to help us (thanks Caroline and Pete). So, I cheekily asked for some land over the road from our Laneway, where growing space is limited – at Western Oval around a community hall that was not being utilised. The aim was to grow food en-masse for our community. But more importantly, we wanted to use this space as an outdoor classroom, as education is at the very core of all we do. And they said yes! And so the Food Is Free Green Space launched three years ago. In  we were so very lucky to win Pick My Project grant funding from the Victorian State Government. With $,, we built the most amazing infrastructure to now host regular workshops and school tours. We are now about to enter our next phase – community development. We intend to garden with as many diverse and marginalised local groups as possible. This excites me most, as it has always been the long-term vision. My mantra has always been that handouts only offer band-aid solutions, whereas education impacts, empowers and lifts people out of hard times. And that knowledge becomes intergenerational. Only .% of our population in Ballarat eats the daily required vegetable intake. Nationally, over a third of the Australian population identifies as food insecure at some point; which is an alarming statistic. Even if the Laneway or Green Space sparks a conversation about food security, our job is done. We have parents who pop in for fruit for lunch boxes, who might be struggling to pay school fees and sundries; folks who are experiencing homeless or sleeping rough, keen to source sustenance without the hassle of paperwork and in a place that’s accessible after hours (most charities are only open during business hours).  We have elderly people who are feeling isolated and keen for conversation, international students who have no access to money or food during COVID, local gardeners with an abundance of food wanting to do some crop swaps… It’s basically all ages, and all colours of the rainbow – and we love them all. I like people coming up with their own definitions on what it means, but personally I was referring to doing some little naughty green acts for the good of the planet. Of pushing a few boundaries, and therefore making people think a bit more about policy that might be restrictive, non-inclusive and antiquated. This is prevalent in my way of questioning things. I have a habit of asking ‘why?’ if anything to do with authority says ‘no’ when it does not make practical sense or lead to social betterment. I believe everyone has the right to ask ‘why?’. Ronni Kahn from OzHarvest is a big one for this, and I learned so much from watching her documentary, Food Fighter. I love the idea of: ‘Non-conformist for the good of others’ health and wellbeing.’ I think that encapsulates green anarchy the best.  Like any charity, we rely on the passion of our incredible volunteer team. We have  volunteers on board right now, who do a variety of jobs including removing spent fruit for composting, tidying the Food Is Free Laneway, weeding and general gardening jobs, worm farming and composting, maintenance, seed saving, honey extraction from our hives, plus admin, graphic design and art. We also have a committee overseeing things like governance. Our volunteers love having a catch up with the regulars – some real friendships have occurred from Food Is Free. Our Laneway is like the old milk bars of the s where you’d go to catch up on local gossip. In terms of people visiting the Laneway, we conducted our own survey a few years ago and the catchment is well over  kms of how far people travel to us. Many were comfortable to admit that they were food insecure, while others visited just for connections, the love of fresh food, or to pay it forward for others. It costs a minimum of $, to keep us afloat each year – most of that is insurance costs. Our biggest challenge is a lack of money, wanting to do more and keeping up demand for food for those in need. We aren’t a food relief agency as such, but we know people like visiting as they do so anonymously – there can be a real stigma in accepting food from other agencies where you have to register your name and details.  We are ramping up our fundraising efforts considerably from now on. It was somewhat neglected, which is so often the case with grassroots mobs experiencing massive growth and gaining larger infrastructure grants. Once you land that fish you then have to work out how to keep going once the money pot runs out. Which for us it has. We are modelling our fundraising with a mix of general public donations and memberships, along with merch and other sales. In the future, we’ll ask local-aligned businesses to sponsor us. We believe everyone has the right to access fresh nutritious food. It’s a fundamental right that is being compromised more and more as the margins between poverty and the rich are widened each day. When people hear about, witness or are part of movements like Food Is Free, it puts hope in the world. What most people forget is the person standing next to them might be one or two pay slips away from sleeping rough or having no food. Or maybe they’re already in that state. We peddle compassion and people know that from the moment they arrive. It shows by example that communities can take action to create their own cohesion and look after each other. It truly is little daily actions that count. John (the Food Is Free founder) is always emphasising that it’s a ripple effect of what we all do, and he is right. One action that catches on and ripples out into the world. Hands down the people I’ve met, the volunteers I’ve befriended and the fact I know most of my neighbours by name now. And seeing people return who months ago were really in a bad state who tell us they’ve started a garden so they can return the food they had to access. Always, always, always include community from the very beginning. It takes a hell of a lot of energy to run these sites. Like serious amounts. But if you put your whole heart into it and rally your neighbours, it will work, I promise. And it will be the best thing you’ve ever done with your time. The rewards are endless.

Starting or renovating a worm farm is a great way to use and value your own renewable resources, in the form of food waste. By the time you’re done, you will be turning your food scraps into worm castings, which are solid and liquid gold for your veggie patch. You don’t need a big backyard to run a worm farm, either – they can work well on balconies, on back steps, or even inside your home. Perfect for any situation, anywhere in the world. And – worm farms are permaculture in action. The video and how-to guide below is a lesson from inside our Permaculture Living online course – a -week program of new skills, habits and ongoing support to enable you to kickstart your household + community resilience, and start living like it matters. If you’d like to learn more, you can join the waitlist here. Permaculture principle # encourages us to ‘Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services’, making the best use of nature’s abundance to reduce our consumption and dependence on non-renewable resources. Creating your very own worm farm is a great way to practice this principle, by turning your food scraps into worm castings, which are solid and liquid gold for your veggie patch, or your indoor plants (used sparingly!), or to share with your neighbours. If you just throw your food scraps in the bin, they will create methane in your local landfill as they break down – a greenhouse gas that’s contributing to climate change. By feeding your worm farm your food scraps, you are making free fertiliser for your garden, avoiding landfill, reducing household waste, reducing methane emissions AND valuing the resources you have around you. You’re converting your kitchen scraps into nutrient-dense, bioavailable plant food of the highest quality – with zero waste and zero emissions in the process. So – let’s learn how to do it. To find out how to choose a worm farm and set it all up at your place – on any scale, large or small – here’s a video with Kirsten from our Permaculture Living course – which will walk you through everything you need to know. Next – here’s some more resources to read through and digest… Worm farms don’t need to be fancy to be efficient. You do not need to spend hundreds of dollars to create a functional, happy and healthy worm farm that will eat all your kitchen scraps. The most common type of worm farms that you will find (or can make) are a series of boxes, stacked ontop of one another, that the worms can pass between. There ARE some really good shop-bought worm farm designs though we’ve included a few of our faves at the bottom of this article. However – if you don’t want to spend a chunk of money to get your first worm farm started, you don’t need to. In essence, a worm farm is a container where compost worms eat your food scraps and then quickly create compost, in the form of their poo or castings, which you can then use as garden fertiliser. One of our favourites, and one of the most simple types, is an in-garden worm tower – a simple vertical pipe with holes drilled in the side that you sink into your garden bed, and put a lid on top. Add some worms, and periodically some kitchen scraps – the castings and juice will leach straight into your garden bed. In six months, pull out the pipe and move it to another part of your garden and start again. We’ve added a bunch more worm farm ideas and designs, both DIY and off-the-shelf, below in the resources at the end of this guide. Compost worms are the lifeforms doing all the work here. The compost worm is a slightly different species to the normal earthworm that you’ll find in your garden soil – they’re sometimes called red wigglers, brandling worms or tiger worms. These worms eat organic material, and the microorganisms that live amongst that material. And they eat a lot. Once your worm farm is working well, you can expect your worms to eat their own bodyweight in scraps each day. That means if you start your worm farm with a kilo of worms, they will soon be able to eat up to a kilo of scraps per day. This is seriously awesome food waste processing. You can source compost worms from a hardware store, community garden, council or a generous worm-giving friend. Basically – veggie scraps of most descriptions. A small amount of bread is okay, but not heaps. Veggie scraps are the go here. There’s some things that red worms do not like to eat, so avoid putting these in your worm farm: Now that said, don’t worry if a tiny bit of this non-ideal stuff ends up in your worm farm – it’s not going to immediately poison your worms – they just won’t be keen to eat it, which means that food may rot instead of being turned into castings. Too much rotten food in a worm farm WILL damage the worm colony’s health, because no-one likes rotting things right next to their dinner – and neither do worms. So – veggie scraps it is. Firstly, a worm farm needs good drainage. As the worms eat through your scraps, they produce castings – their poo – and also liquid, which needs to be able to drain off effectively so that the worms don’t drown, and so your worm farm doesn’t go all stinky and anaerobic. Secondly, your worm farm will need a regular supply of carbon – things like leaves or shredded newspaper – as well as high-nitrogen kitchen scraps. This is to ensure the worms have a balanced diet and, again, so your worm farm doesn’t go all sludgy and stinky. A good balance to stick to is  per cent carbon and  per cent food scraps. Thirdly, remember that worms have small mouths! This means that although they can eventually break down big chunks of scraps, like whole cabbage leaves, they much prefer smaller bits. If you’re putting big bits of stuff in your worm farm, chop them up a bit first and your worms will be super happy. Placement and temperature is the last big thing to consider for your worm farm. Ideally, keep your worm farm somewhere that won’t get too hot, or too cold, and that you visit every day.  Worms like the same temperature range as humans – so they will be most productive at around - degrees Celsius, or - degrees fahrenheit. Below that range, your worms will slow right down, and eat much less food. And above that range, they will abandon the top of your worm farm, where the food scraps are, for a cooler spot down the bottom, leaving your food scraps to rot. Somewhere close to the house that’s out of direct sunlight is often ideal, or even on your back porch or inside your laundry. Keeping your worm farm cosy and also nearby ensures regular feeding and an even temperature – two things that will help your worm farm to thrive. So now you have all the knowledge, let’s look at starting a worm farm. You can also use this method if you have an existing worm farm that’s not doing well – take it apart and renovate it a bit. The above article will take you through all the steps of actually setting up (or reviving!) your worm farm once you have it, or make it. The idea with worm farms is that the worms slowly continue to travel upward in search of food, leaving behind trays and trays of rich worm castings, with the worm juice dripping out the bottom. Once you have a few trays of castings below your food scraps, you can start harvesting from the bottom of your worm farm, to add worm castings to your garden, or to swap with your neighbours for their gardens. Castings are super-duper fertiliser for your plants, but it’s very strong stuff, so don’t use too much in any one place. We sprinkle the castings lightly around the base of plants throughout the growing season, right before watering. Brassicas LOVE them. We also add worm castings to our seed raising mix because the castings provide a rich fertliser component for the growing seeds. If you get into worm farming and love it, don’t stop there. Your local school or community garden may welcome some help with their worm farming system too. These are skills to be shared, which have real-life outcomes for the fertility and abundance of your neighbourhood – so don’t be shy, get out there and spread the wormy love. Good luck, and let us know how you go? Thanks to all the team who helped make the Permaculture Living course and all its resources possible. You are awesome. Thank you to Dylan, our videographer.

"Sharing veggies with neighbours via an honesty stall plonked out the front of your place is an amazing way to build community connection and local resilience – and it’s really fun, too. The basic ideas is this – You bang together some kind of stall out of secondhand shelves, a bookcase, a broken old fridge … anything that works for you. Then collect up the produce you have to spare – all those homegrown zucchinis, perhaps, or fruit from that feral apricot tree down the road, or dried herbs for tea; whatever really. Pop it on the stall and allow passers-by to take what they wish. You can assign prices and leave a cash box on your stall, and trust that people will respect the honesty system and pay correctly (which they mostly do, even in urban areas). Or you can share food absolutely free, following the ‘take what you need, give what you can’ philosophy. The surprising thing about creating such a stall, is that it becomes about so much more than food. I say all this as a fairly new stall-keeper myself. In September , my partner Carmelo and I launched a tiny urban honesty stall out the front of our Adelaide rental, on Kaurna land. It’s since become a low-key obsession of ours. We initially created our stall, called The Local Yum, with plans to share excess produce from our backyard veggie patch.  Side note: this was probably a touch ambitious. We’re novice gardeners, growing on our sq m rental property, and barely produce enough to feed ourselves. But we love to forage wild foods, glean unwanted fruit from city trees, and make things out of plants that some folks consider useless weeds. So it works. Somehow. I guess I’m saying: you definitely don’t need to be a super-gardener or have a huge growing space to become an honesty stall-keeper. We’ve discovered the simple act of sharing food via our stall becomes a daily invitation to interact with literally all  permaculture principles. For example –  Use Edges and Value the Marginal (principle ): Street verges are the most marginal spaces in urban areas, often unplanted, uncared for and sprayed repeatedly by councils. We’ve reclaimed ours, planted it out, made it a space for community sharing – and perhaps gently encouraged others to think more creatively about the space between their front gate and the road. Observe and Interact (principle ): This takes so many forms – where is the sun falling on our stall as the seasons change, and how is this affecting our produce? Which products do people love and which tend to sit on the stall for longer, and therefore might need a bit more explanation or tweaking? Produce No Waste (principle ): We aim to package our products in recycled materials as much as possible. So when we run out of jars, rubber bands or pot plants, we pop a sign on the stall asking our community to leave us their old ones, and pretty quickly donations come flooding in. It’s a simple way we can keep the circle of reuse happening in our local community. Apply Self-Regulation and Accept Feedback (principle ): A little notebook and a pen left on our stall allows passers-by to give us feedback. It’s lovely to receive a handwritten note, and folks often leave helpful suggestions about what would work better for them. And I could go on! But I think you get the picture – honesty stalls really can be a practical way to put permaculture into action at your place. Then there are folks who choose to share food absolutely free. If you’re wanting to give this a try, there’s a few well-established movements you could get involved with for support and ideas. The Food is Free Project began in Texas in . It encourages you to connect with your neighbours by planting a front yard garden or sharing your harvest via a #foodisfree table. It has since grown into a worldwide community and food movement, with hundreds of cities involved. Perhaps the best-known example here in Australia is Food is Free Ballarat – at the junction of Wadawurrung and Djab Wurrung country. Lou Ridsdale (who also happens to be a Milkwood Permaculture Living course graduate, and who is a total legend besides) started the project in  from a laneway next to her rental – a place for people to drop off or collect surplus nutritious food for free, while connecting with the local neighbourhood. In a similar vein, Andrew Barker began Grow Free in South Australia in , initially just by giving away seedlings in his backyard. That quickly grew to a national movement of Grow Free carts (you can see a map of them here), all sharing produce, seedlings and more under the motto: ‘Take what you need, give what you can.’ “Mostly, we give our time and energy to others just because we can. Because no matter how dire things may seem, compassion can always shine through” – that’s the beautiful way Andrew summed it up during his TEDx Adelaide talk.  Other options include community sharing corners, like this cute one by local legend Anna, The Urban Nanna in Naarm/Melbourne. Or you might join Food Not Lawns, an international network of gardeners and activists dedicated to sharing food, seeds, tools, land, skills and other resources with folks in their local communities.

Hey there, holidays! Whew, are we glad to see YOU this year. And now that we have a little more time – wondering what to make or brew, this end of year? Here’s a bunch of delicious permaculture holiday recipes for you to try – to make, bake and ferment – using found and foraged ingredients, seasonal goodness, and whatever you have at hand.

Burdock (Arctium spp.) is a biennial plant native to Europe and Asia, naturalized in many temperate regions worldwide, including North America and Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae (daisy) family and is best known for its edible taproot, traditionally used in Asian and European herbal medicine and cuisine. In its first year, burdock forms a low-growing rosette of large, heart-shaped basal leaves with wavy margins and a woolly underside. These leaves can span – cm (– in) in length and resemble those of rhubarb, though they are unrelated. The deep taproot develops during this phase, growing up to  cm ( ft) long and tapering with a brownish-gray exterior and white interior. The root is harvested in its first year for culinary or medicinal use. In the second year, the plant bolts, producing a tall, branching flower stalk that can reach .–. m (– ft) in height. Stems are hollow, ridged, and may show a reddish tinge. Burdock’s flowers appear in mid- to late summer, forming rounded, thistle-like purple or pinkish flower heads clustered at the ends of branches. These are surrounded by hooked bracts that readily cling to fur and fabric—a feature that inspired the invention of Velcro®. After flowering, the plant sets seed and dies. Burdock produces a prolific number of seeds within burrs, which disperse by attaching to animals and humans. Though considered a weed in some regions due to its robust growth and seed spread, burdock is also cultivated for food and herbal use. It prefers disturbed soils, roadsides, and sunny to partially shaded areas with good drainage. Culinary varieties of Arctium lappa (commonly known as greater burdock or gobo in Japanese cuisine) have been selectively bred for longer, straighter, and less fibrous roots. All parts of the plant—root, leaf, flower, and seed—have traditional applications in food or herbal medicine. Burdock is best grown as a biennial crop but is typically cultivated as an annual when the taproot is the desired harvest. In the first year, the plant produces large leaves and a long, edible taproot. If left to grow a second year, it will flower and produce seeds. It thrives in cool to mild climates, ideally between –°C (–°F). While relatively cold-hardy, growth slows significantly below °C (°F), and high temperatures above °C (°F) can lead to premature bolting or stress, negatively affecting root development. In regions with freezing winters, sowing in late spring after the last frost allows for optimal root development before cold weather returns. In areas with milder winters, burdock may also be sown in autumn for an early spring harvest the following year. The plant requires deep, loose, fertile soil to accommodate its long taproot and grows best with moderate, consistent moisture—avoiding waterlogged conditions to prevent rot. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Harvest Time: Harvesting Tips: Burdock root is a popular ingredient in East Asian cooking, particularly in Japan, where it is called “gobo.” Often peeled and cut into matchsticks or thin slices, it appears in stir-fries, soups, and stews, lending a mildly sweet, earthy flavor. One classic dish is kinpira gobo, in which burdock root is sautéed with carrots, then simmered in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. This preparation accentuates the root’s pleasant crunch and sweet-savory profile. Beyond Asian cuisines, burdock’s root can be braised, roasted, or boiled like other root vegetables. When cooked slowly, the tough fibers break down, giving the root a tender, almost buttery consistency. In some European herbal traditions, small amounts of sliced burdock root are added to broths or stews for its subtly nutty undertone. Young leaves, though slightly bitter, can also be eaten fresh in salads or sautéed with other greens for a robust flavor. Because of its strong taproot, burdock often stores water and nutrients, resulting in a vegetable rich in dietary fiber and small amounts of vitamins and minerals. Its distinctive taste is sometimes compared to artichoke hearts or salsify. For added convenience, burdock can be peeled and parboiled, then stored in the fridge for quick incorporation into meals throughout the week. Whether you prefer a straightforward approach—like roasting with olive oil—or a more intricate recipe with bold spices, burdock’s unique flavor profile makes it a versatile addition to diverse cuisines. In conclusion, burdock rewards gardeners with long, edible roots and showy purple flowers, provided its growth and spread are managed carefully. With the right conditions and a bit of patience, this old-world plant offers culinary, medicinal, and even innovative uses (like its burr-inspired role in Velcro®) that enrich both the garden and the table.;Deep Green Permaculture
Pilea peperomioides, commonly known as the Chinese Money Plant, is a unique and visually striking houseplant prized for its glossy, round, coin-like leaves that appear to radiate from a central stem. This distinctive leaf shape is the source of its common name, symbolizing wealth, prosperity, and good fortune in Chinese culture. Native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China, the plant gained international popularity in the mid-th century when a Norwegian missionary brought it to Europe, where it was shared among plant lovers and earned the nickname “pass-along plant” due to its ease of propagation. With its sculptural form and charming symmetry, the Chinese Money Plant complements modern and minimalist interiors alike. It is also considered a symbol of friendship and generosity, often gifted to others as a sign of goodwill. This guide provides detailed care instructions to help your Chinese Money Plant flourish. Scientific Name: Pilea peperomioides Common Names: Chinese Money Plant, Pancake Plant, UFO Plant, Missionary Plant Origin: Native to the subtropical regions of southern China, specifically the Yunnan Province. The plant became popular in the West after being brought to Europe by Norwegian missionaries in the mid-th century, hence one of its nicknames—Missionary Plant. Description: The Chinese Money Plant is a small, herbaceous perennial characterized by its perfectly round, glossy green leaves that are attached to long, slender petioles. The leaves resemble coins or pancakes and emerge from a central, upright stem, giving the plant a sculptural, minimalist aesthetic. It typically grows  to  cm ( to  inches) tall and wide when mature. Over time, the plant produces offshoots (pups) around its base, which can be separated and propagated easily. Benefits: Aside from its striking appearance and easy propagation, the Chinese Money Plant is also known to improve indoor air quality. Its modest size makes it ideal for small spaces such as shelves, desks, and windowsills. It also has a reputation for bringing good luck and prosperity, making it a popular gift plant. Watering Needs: The Chinese Money Plant prefers moderately moist soil. Water thoroughly when the top – cm (about  inch) of soil feels dry to the touch. Reduce watering frequency during the cooler months when the plant’s growth slows. Avoid overwatering and make sure the pot has proper drainage, as the plant is sensitive to waterlogged conditions which can lead to root rot. Soil and Potting: Use a well-draining, high-quality potting mix rich in organic matter. A general-purpose indoor plant mix with added perlite or pumice will help improve drainage and aeration. Avoid using heavy soils that retain too much moisture. Repot the plant every  to  years in early spring to refresh the soil and provide more room for root development and offset growth. Light Requirements and Lux Levels: Pilea peperomioides thrives in bright, indirect light but is adaptable to moderate indoor conditions. Using a lux meter can help you assess whether the plant is receiving adequate light. If the plant starts leaning toward a light source, rotate it regularly to maintain balanced growth. Temperature and Humidity: The Chinese Money Plant thrives in average indoor temperatures between °C and °C (°F to °F). Avoid exposure to cold drafts, temperatures below °C (°F), or sudden changes in environment. It prefers moderate humidity but can tolerate typical indoor levels. If the air is very dry, occasional misting or placing the pot on a humidity tray can help maintain leaf health. Fertilization and Pruning: Feed your Chinese Money Plant once a month during the growing season (spring through early autumn) with a balanced liquid houseplant fertilizer diluted to half strength. Avoid fertilizing during the winter months when growth is minimal. Pruning is minimal—simply remove any yellow or damaged leaves at the base. You can also pinch off the top of the main stem to encourage a bushier form if the plant becomes too tall or leggy. Chinese Money Plants are very easy to propagate by division thanks to their habit of producing basal offshoots or “pups” around the base of the main stem. These can be removed and grown into new plants with minimal effort. Here’s how to propagate them successfully: Step : Prepare Your Tools and Materials Step : Locate a Pup – Look for a healthy offset or pup growing from the base of the mother plant. It should be at least – cm (– inches) tall and have several leaves of its own. Ideally, it will also have visible roots emerging from the base. Step : Detach the Pup – Using sterilised shears or a sharp knife, gently cut the pup away from the mother plant, taking care to retain any attached roots. If the pup has no roots, you can still propagate it, but rooting may take longer. Step : Plant the Pup – Fill a small pot with fresh potting mix and plant the pup at the same depth it was growing in the mother plant’s pot. Firm the soil gently around it to support the stem. Step : Water and Maintain – Water lightly and place the new plant in a bright, indirect light location. If the pup lacks roots or humidity is low, covering it with a clear plastic bag can help retain moisture and speed up rooting. Within a few weeks, roots should develop and growth will resume. Chinese Money Plants are generally pest-resistant but may occasionally attract common indoor pests such as aphids, spider mites, or fungus gnats. Inspect the plant regularly and treat infestations with neem oil or insecticidal soap. Yellowing leaves often indicate overwatering, while curling or crispy edges may suggest low humidity or excessive sunlight. Leggy stems are typically a sign of inadequate light. With its symmetrical growth and sculptural appeal, the Chinese Money Plant is perfect for tabletops, shelves, and windowsills. Its compact size makes it ideal for minimalist and Scandinavian-inspired interiors. Group several propagated pups together in different pots for a charming and modern plant display. It also pairs beautifully with decorative planters that highlight its unique foliage. In summary, Pilea peperomioides is a visually striking, easy-care plant that’s perfect for modern homes and beginner gardeners alike. With proper care and occasional propagation, this charming species can become a long-lasting and shareable part of your indoor plant collection. Whether you’re drawn to its appearance, symbolism, or ease of care, the Chinese Money Plant is a delightful addition to any home.;Deep Green Permaculture
"Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana), often called sugar leaf, is a tender perennial herb famously cultivated for its sweet-tasting leaves. In frost-free climates, plants can live multiple years, but they’re commonly grown as annuals where winters are cold. They typically reach – cm (– in) in height, forming upright stems adorned with elliptical leaves about – cm (– in) long. The leaves contain steviol glycosides, which provide a sweetness substantially stronger than table sugar, though with a distinct flavor profile. In summer or early autumn, small, white, daisy-like flowers bloom at stem tips, each producing tiny, light-brown seeds. However, stevia is often propagated vegetatively to ensure consistent sweetness levels and vigor. Stevia is best suited to temperatures in the range of –°C (–°F). Optimal growth occurs around –°C (–°F). It requires warm soil, consistent sunlight, and mild conditions, making late spring or early summer ideal for outdoor planting after the threat of frost has passed. Since stevia is sensitive to cold, temperatures below °C (°F) can hamper its growth and delay leaf production. In regions with cooler or shorter growing seasons, starting stevia cuttings or seeds indoors – weeks before the last frost and transplanting them once nighttime temperatures reliably exceed °C (°F) can significantly improve success. Stevia also prefers well-drained, fertile soil and moderate watering—moist but not waterlogged. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Harvest Time: Leaves can be harvested once plants reach about – cm (– in) tall, typically – weeks after transplant. For best sweetness, some gardeners wait until stevia begins to form flower buds. You can harvest leaves gradually throughout the season or cut the entire plant for a final harvest before temperatures drop. Harvesting Tips: Use scissors or pinch off leaves and stem tips, leaving enough foliage for continued growth. Rinse leaves gently and pat them dry if planning to store or process. Dry them in a well-ventilated, shaded area or use a food dehydrator. Once crispy, crush the leaves into a powder or store them whole. Produce New Plants From: Seeds, but cuttings or divisions are more reliable. Stem cuttings root readily in water or moist potting mix Stevia’s primary culinary appeal lies in its leaves’ intense sweetness—certain glycosides can be up to – times sweeter than cane sugar. Fresh leaves can be used directly for sweetening herbal teas or fruit salads; simply bruise or chop them so the sweet compounds release. However, the raw leaf taste may exhibit a slight, licorice-like or bitter aftertaste, which some find more pronounced than refined sugar. Drying or lightly processing leaves can mitigate bitterness while retaining sweetness. When dried, crushed stevia leaves can be sprinkled into coffee, smoothies, or sauces for a sugar-free sweet boost. Alternatively, many cooks brew a stevia “tea” concentrate by simmering fresh leaves in water, then straining it—creating a sweet liquid that can be stored in the refrigerator for a week or two. This infusion can be drizzled over cereals, yogurt, or baked goods. Commercial stevia extracts often refine away some of the more bitter glycosides, resulting in a smoother flavor, but home gardeners can experiment with different approaches to find what works best for their palate. Drying stevia leaves removes their high water content, concentrating the sweet compounds—primarily steviol glycosides—and making dried leaves significantly sweeter than fresh ones. While exact ratios can vary, dried stevia leaves are generally several times sweeter than fresh leaves by weight. This heightened sweetness necessitates careful measurement when substituting dried stevia in recipes to prevent over-sweetening. While stevia provides sweetness, it does not offer sugar’s bulk or caramelizing properties in baked goods—recipes often require adjustments, such as adding bulking agents or altering cooking times. Despite this, stevia can be an excellent choice for those managing sugar intake, using it in recipes like fruit sauces, whipped toppings, or dessert dips where sugar’s textural role is less critical. Whether used fresh or in a homemade extract, stevia offers a naturally sweet alternative that can complement a wide array of healthy, sugar-reduced dishes. In conclusion, stevia presents a unique opportunity for gardeners seeking a naturally sweet herb that can thrive in warm conditions. While slightly more sensitive to cold and variable in taste if grown from seed, stevia rewards careful cultivation with leaves that can sweeten beverages, desserts, and sauces—all from a simple, green plant in your home garden.";Deep Green Permaculture
Buckwheat is a fast-growing, herbaceous broadleaf annual plant belonging to the Polygonaceae (knotweed or smartweed) family, which also includes rhubarb, sorrel, and dock. It is grown for its seeds which can be used in a similar way to wheat or oats. Although it is used like a grain, buckwheat is classified as a pseudocereal, because, it is not a true cereal, as it does not belong to the grass family (Poaceae). The buckwheat plant is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to poor soil conditions as it is abile to grow in low-fertility, well-drained soils where many other crops would struggle.. Plants have a spindly, upright form and typically grow to a height of – cm (– inches) and have hollow, grooved, and often reddish-green stems that branch in the upper portion of the plant. Buckwheat has a short taproot with few fibrous side roots and a relatively shallow root system. It grows best in light, well-drained soils where its limited root depth allows for rapid early growth, but it does not tolerate compacted or waterlogged conditions well. Plants have small heart-shaped leaves that are typically – cm (.– inches) wide. The leaves are alternate and broadly triangular to heart-shaped (sagittate or cordate), with smooth edges and prominent veins, with long petioles (leaf stems). The lower leaves are larger and basal (forming a rosette near the base of the stem), while the upper ones are smaller and more lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of of small, five-petaled flowers that range from white to pale pink, that when pollinated, quickly produce seeds. Each flower is hermaphroditic (containing both male and female reproductive organs) and rich in nectar, making buckwheat highly attractive to pollinators. Flowering begins approximately – weeks after sowing and continues over several weeks, even as seeds mature. The plant is indeterminate in flowering and seed production (it continually flowers and sets seed over an extended period rather than all at once). The fruits of the buckwheat plant are small, hard, triangular achenes—technically a type of dry fruit—that measure – mm (.–. inches) in length. They develop from the pollinated flowers and change in color from light green to reddish-brown or black as they mature. Each achene consists of a starchy inner seed, known as a groat, enclosed within a thick, fibrous hull. The seeds do not mature all at the same time across the plant, which makes harvest timing critical to minimize seed loss from early shattering. Buckwheat typically reaches maturity around – weeks after sowing. Buckwheat is an excellent cover crop, taking only – weeks from seed to flower and can protect against soil erosion and invasion by weeds. Unlike many grains, buckwheat does not tolerate frost at any stage of growth and is typically grown as a summer crop. Buckwheat may also be referred to by local names such as qiáomài (荞麦) in Chinese and ogal in Korean. It was likely first domesticated in the highlands of southwestern China, particularly in the Yunnan region, from its wild ancestor Fagopyrum esculentum ssp. ancestrale. Buckwheat can be used as a wheat substitute in a wide range of foods, including pancakes, cakes, and biscuits. It is also commonly used in breakfast cereals or ground into flour for baking. Additionally, the grain can serve as animal fodder. Buckwheat is a warm-season crop that grows optimally in temperate or sub-tropical climates where the temperatures are between –°C (–°F), with the optimal growing temperature being around °C (°F). It may also be grown successfully in more tropical climates at higher elevation. Buckwheat is sensitive to frost, and temperatures below °C (°F) can damage the plants. Additionally, buckwheat plants require a period of dry weather for harvest. Buckwheat grows best in well-drained, moderately fertile loamy soils with consistent sunlight. While it is tolerant of poor or low-fertility soils and often used as a soil-improving cover crop, it performs best when soil is not waterlogged. Excess moisture can lead to root rot, so good drainage and moderate, consistent watering are important for optimal growth. Buckwheat is best sown in late spring to early summer, after the danger of frost has passed, as it is highly sensitive to cold, and thrives in warm conditions. Although sometimes planted in autumn in warmer climates, it performs best when stimulated by warm temperatures and longer day lengths, which promote rapid growth and flowering. In cooler climates or regions with short summers, buckwheat can be used as a fast-growing summer cover crop to improve soil health, suppress weeds, and support pollinators. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Buckwheat groats can be cooked similar to rice, used in porridge, ground into flour for baking, or toasted (known as kasha), making them a versatile pseudocereal used in various culinary traditions worldwide. Groats and Kasha: Buckwheat groats, the hulled seeds of the plant, can be cooked similarly to rice or quinoa. When roasted, they are known as kasha, a staple in Eastern European cuisine. Kasha can be prepared as a savory side dish or incorporated into dishes like kasha varnishkes, which combines kasha with pasta and onions. Porridge: Buckwheat groats can be boiled to make a hearty porridge, often enjoyed for breakfast. This porridge can be sweetened with honey or fruit or made savory with additions like mushrooms or herbs. Flour Applications: Buckwheat flour is gluten-free and imparts a nutty flavor to baked goods. It is commonly used in pancakes, crepes (such as French galettes), muffins, and bread. In Japanese cuisine, buckwheat flour is the primary ingredient in soba noodles. Salads and Side Dishes: Cooked buckwheat groats can be cooled and added to salads, providing a chewy texture and nutty flavor. They can also be used as a base for grain bowls or mixed with roasted vegetables. Desserts: Buckwheat flour is used in various desserts, including cookies, cakes, and tarts, offering a unique flavor profile. Its earthy taste pairs well with ingredients like chocolate, nuts, and fruits. Overall, buckwheat’s adaptability in both sweet and savory dishes, along with its nutritional benefits, makes it a valuable ingredient in diverse culinary contexts. In conclusion, buckwheat is an incredibly versatile and beneficial crop, suitable for improving soil health, providing quick harvests, and supporting local wildlife and pollinators. It’s an excellent choice for gardeners looking to explore new and beneficial crops.;Deep Green Permaculture

The Fiddle Leaf Fig, scientifically known as Ficus lyrata, has become a modern indoor design icon thanks to its dramatic, violin-shaped leaves and bold vertical presence. Its striking foliage and architectural form make it a favorite for adding a sophisticated, sculptural touch to interiors. This detailed guide covers everything you need to know about caring for the Fiddle Leaf Fig, ensuring it thrives and brings beauty to your space. Scientific Name: Ficus lyrata Common Names: Fiddle Leaf Fig, Banjo Fig Origin: Native to the lowland tropical rainforests of western and central Africa Description: The Fiddle Leaf Fig is a tall, upright-growing evergreen tree with large, glossy green leaves shaped like a fiddle or violin—broad at the top and tapering at the base. Indoors, it typically grows between . to  metres ( to  feet) tall but can be pruned to maintain a manageable size. Each leaf can reach up to  cm ( inches) long, and the plant grows best when allowed to stretch upward in bright, airy spaces. Benefits: Beyond its visual impact, the Fiddle Leaf Fig is also known to help improve indoor air quality by filtering airborne pollutants. It adds bold, structured greenery to rooms and pairs well with modern and minimalist décor. While a bit finicky about its environment, with the right conditions and care, it can become a long-lasting and rewarding indoor plant. Watering Needs: Fiddle Leaf Figs prefer consistently moist, but not soggy, soil. Water thoroughly once the top – cm (– inches) of soil are dry, allowing excess water to drain away completely. Avoid letting the plant sit in standing water. In winter, reduce watering frequency as growth slows. Sudden changes in moisture can cause leaf drop, so strive for consistency in your watering routine. Soil and Potting: Use a well-draining, peat-based potting mix enriched with perlite or pine bark for improved aeration. Ensure your pot has good drainage holes to prevent root rot. Repot every – years in spring or early summer, or when the plant becomes root-bound. Choose a pot just one size larger to avoid overpotting, which can retain too much moisture. Light Requirements and Lux Levels: Fiddle Leaf Figs thrive in bright, indirect light and prefer a consistent source of natural light. Using a lux meter to measure light intensity can help ensure your plant is receiving enough light to maintain healthy leaf development and upright growth. Temperature and Humidity: Fiddle Leaf Figs prefer warm conditions between °C and °C (°F to °F). They are sensitive to drafts, sudden temperature fluctuations, and cold air, so keep them away from vents, doors, and windows during colder months. Humidity should be kept above %. If indoor air is dry, especially in winter, consider misting the leaves, using a humidifier, or placing the pot on a pebble tray with water. Fertilization and Pruning: Feed with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half strength every  weeks during spring and summer. Pause fertilizing in autumn and winter when growth slows. Prune in late winter or early spring to control height and shape. Always cut just above a leaf node to encourage branching. Remove any dead, damaged, or lower leaves to promote airflow and improve appearance. Fiddle Leaf Figs are prone to common indoor plant pests such as spider mites, mealybugs, scale, and thrips. Inspect regularly and wipe leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust and check for signs of pests. Treat infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Browning leaf edges may indicate low humidity or inconsistent watering, while yellowing leaves can signal overwatering. Dropping leaves often result from environmental stress—especially moving the plant, low light, or cold drafts. Maintain stable conditions for best results. Fiddle Leaf Figs can be propagated from stem cuttings using either water or soil as the rooting medium. Here’s how: Step : Prepare Your Tools and Materials Step : Take a Cutting – Select a healthy stem that is – cm (– inches) long and includes at least one node (a slightly raised area on the stem where a leaf is or was attached—this is where roots will form) and several healthy leaves. Using sterilised shears, make a clean cut just below a node. Step : Prepare the Cutting – Remove the lower leaves on the cutting to expose the node(s), leaving one or two leaves at the top to support photosynthesis. If using rooting hormone, dip the cut end into the powder to encourage faster root growth. Step : Plant the Cutting Step : Water and Care for the Cutting – Roots typically form within – weeks. In water, wait until roots are at least .– cm (– inches) long before transplanting into soil. For soil-propagated cuttings, gently tug after a few weeks to feel for resistance, indicating root formation. Once rooted, treat the cutting as a young fiddle leaf fig and care for it in bright, indirect light with regular watering. The Fiddle Leaf Fig’s dramatic leaves and tall, upright form make it an exceptional statement plant. It is most often displayed as a floor plant in bright corners, living rooms, or near large windows where it can receive ample light. Its bold silhouette complements modern, Scandinavian, and mid-century décor. For visual balance, pair it with pots in neutral tones or natural materials like wood and stone. Smaller, younger plants can also be placed on plant stands, shelves, or console tables. Grouping it with other tropical plants or contrasting textures like ferns or trailing vines can create a dynamic indoor plant arrangement. In summary, the Fiddle Leaf Fig (Ficus lyrata) is a bold and elegant houseplant that, with the right care, can transform an interior with its towering height and oversized foliage. While it demands a bit more consistency in light, humidity, and watering than some easier houseplants, the payoff is substantial. By following the care guidelines outlined in this article, your Fiddle Leaf Fig can thrive, adding sculptural beauty and lush greenery to your living space for years to come.;Deep Green Permaculture
Endive is a cool-season leafy vegetable generally grown as an annual. It forms a dense rosette of frilly, lobed leaves, which can be broad and curly (frisée) or slightly flatter (escarole). Mature plants often measure – cm (– in) high and equally wide, though some varieties can be larger. Leaves range from pale to dark green on the exterior, with paler or even yellowish inner foliage. If allowed to bolt—usually under high heat or left for a second season—endive produces an inflorescence (cluster or group of flowers arranged on a plant’s branches) consisting of – small, blue to lavender flowers typical of the chicory species of plants, followed by dandelion-like seed heads containing small, ribbed seeds. Although it is technically biennial, most gardeners harvest endive in a single season for its tender, mildly bitter leaves. Endive is a cool-season crop that grows best in temperatures ranging from about –°C (–°F), with the optimal growing temperature around –°C (–°F), making spring or autumn plantings ideal in most climates. Prolonged heat above °C (°F) can trigger bolting or produce overly bitter leaves. The plants will tolerate light frost and harvesting after frost will improve the flavor of the leaves. They prefer full sun but tolerate partial sun, especially in hot climates. Endives requires a loose, fertile, well-draining soil and consistent moisture. Sow seeds directly into the ground or start them indoors in seedling pots or trays. Endive seeds germinate at temperatures between .–.°C (°F and °F), with °C (°F) being optimal. In cooler or short-season areas, starting endive seeds indoors – weeks before the average last frost allows transplants to establish more quickly outdoors once soil temperatures warm slightly. For direct sowing, plant seeds outdoors  to  weeks before the average last frost date, when the soil is workable. Conversely, in milder-winter regions, a late-summer sowing can mature in the more comfortable autumn period. For an autumn crop, sow seeds about three months before the average first autumn frost date. When sowing seeds directly into the ground, sow seeds – cm (– in) apart, leaving approximately  cm ( in) between rows. Once seedlings are .– cm (–. inches) high, thin them to – cm (– inches) apart to allow adequate space for growth. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Harvest Time: Endive is ready when the head forms a rosette of sufficient size—usually – weeks after sowing for mature heads, or earlier for baby-leaf salads. If you’re blanching, factor in an additional – weeks at the end of the growth cycle. For best quality, harvest before outer leaves turn coarse or the center bolts. Harvest the plants early if very hot weather or a hard frost is expected. Harvesting Tips: Use a sharp knife to cut the plant at the base, just above the soil surface. Discard tough or damaged outer leaves. For a cut-and-come-again approach, trim only the outer leaves, letting the center regrow. Store harvested heads in the refrigerator, lightly wrapped in a breathable plastic bag to retain moisture. Endive’s crisp texture and distinctive, mildly bitter flavor lend themselves to various culinary applications. In salads, frisée endive (frilly leaves) contributes a dramatic appearance alongside more tender greens, offering a pleasant contrast that pairs well with tangy dressings. Escarole, a broader-leaf endive type, is commonly used in Italian-style soups (like “escarole and bean”) or simply wilted in olive oil and garlic, where its natural bitterness balances rich or savory flavors. Because endive leaves retain a sturdy structure when heated, they can be braised or grilled to highlight a caramelized sweetness that contrasts with the mildly bitter undertone. One classic preparation is to gently cook escarole in chicken or vegetable stock with aromatics until the leaves become silky and succulent—a technique that emphasizes its adaptability to gentle cooking. For a quick weeknight side, a simple sauté of chopped escarole with minced garlic, chili flakes, and a splash of lemon juice transforms it into a bright, flavorful dish. In French and Belgian cuisines, endive might be wrapped in ham and baked with a creamy sauce, highlighting its ability to stand up to richer ingredients. Raw endive—particularly the narrower Belgian endive variety (though botanically a different Cichorium species)—often acts as a vessel for dips or fillings, thanks to its elongated leaves. Similarly, young escarole leaves can be torn into smaller pieces and combined with fruit, nuts, and cheese in robust salads. From fresh salads to comforting soups, endive’s versatility makes it a favorite among cooks seeking a green that brings an interesting flavor edge to meals. In conclusion, endive offers a slightly bitter twist on typical salad greens, thriving in cooler conditions and benefitting from careful timing and modest care. Whether eaten raw in crisp salads or gently braised, endive’s culinary range and nutrient benefits make it a worthy addition to diverse home gardens.;Deep Green Permaculture
"The way plant leaves work, they face a perpetual trade-off: they must open microscopic pores (stomata) to breathe in the carbon dioxide needed for sugar production, yet every open pore also loses precious water and exposes the green chlorophyll, the key carbon-fixing enzyme that produces sugars, to disruptive levels of oxygen—especially when leaf temperature soars. Over time, plants have evolved to solve this dilemma in three distinct ways utilize distinct anatomical features and biochemical processes: Understanding how anatomy, physiology and biochemistry mesh in each pathway explains real-world contrasts: cool-season lettuces bolt in midsummer heat while sorghum races ahead; a temperate lawn browns during drought, yet a bed of agaves remains pristine. The sections that follow profile C₃, C₄ and CAM in that order—moving from leaf structure through functional dynamics to the molecular steps that drive carbon gain—and finish with clear, pathway-specific advice on crop timing, irrigation and nutrient practice for gardeners and growers. A typical foliage leaf is a layered organ. The epidermis on each surface carries adjustable pores called stomata (sing. stoma), each pore bordered by two guard-cells that open or close to balance gas exchange with water loss. Beneath the upper epidermis lies the palisade mesophyll, a column of chloroplast-rich cells where most light is captured. Deeper still is the spongy mesophyll, a looser tissue riddled with air spaces that let CO₂ diffuse toward chloroplasts and let O₂ and water vapour escape. Veins, wrapped by bundle-sheath cells (large, starch-storing cells packed with chloroplasts in some species), deliver water and export sugar. Finally, many succulent species enlarge a central membrane-bounded vacuole that can store organic acids overnight—crucial for one of the pathways described later. Knowing this anatomy establishes where each carbon-fixation strategy plays out. When stomata open, CO₂ diffuses inward but water vapour diffuses out far faster. At moderate temperature and humidity the loss is acceptable. Under high light, high heat or dry wind, two linked problems emerge: Plants that keep the classical arrangement must tolerate these costs; others evolved work-arounds that either increase the internal CO₂ concentration or shift gas exchange to a safer time of day. With the leaf’s structure and its CO₂-versus-water dilemma now clear, the next section explains how plants have evolved three distinct carbon-concentration pathways—C₃, C₄ and CAM—to keep photosynthesis running efficiently under very different climates. By seeing how each pathway builds on specific anatomy and timing tricks, you’ll understand why some species flourish in cool gardens, others in blazing summer fields, and still others on the driest desert rock. C₃ photosynthesis is the oldest and by far the most widespread mode of carbon fixation, powering about  % of all vascular plant species and accounting for the bulk of global terrestrial productivity. It dominates whole biomes—from boreal conifer and temperate hardwood forests to the shaded understorey of tropical rainforests—because it functions efficiently where daytime leaf temperatures remain below roughly  °C and soil moisture is dependable. Under those conditions, temperate cereals (wheat, rice, oats), legumes, deciduous fruit trees, tall forest trees and many shade-adapted ornamentals achieve their highest yields. With a few specialised exceptions, the vast majority of familiar food and landscape plants rely on the C₃ pathway: almost all legumes (whether grown for dry pulses, fresh pods or nitrogen-fixing green manure), the temperate leafy and brassica vegetables we use in salads and stir-fries, the warm-season “fruit” vegetables such as tomato, capsicum, eggplant and cucumber, nearly every root, tuber and bulb crop from potato and carrot to onion and garlic, the soft fruits and berries like strawberry, raspberry and blueberry, the classic orchard trees in the pome and stone-fruit groups (apple, pear, peach, cherry, plum), most evergreen or subtropical fruit trees including citrus, avocado and olive, the common temperate nut trees (almond, walnut, hazelnut and pecan), the cool-season forage and turf grasses such as perennial ryegrass and tall fescue, and the dominant shade or forest trees and ornamentals—oaks, maples, beeches, hostas and impatiens—are all C₃ plants. How the pathway works: C₃ (direct fixation)
During daylight, C₃ plants open their stomata fully, accept the resulting moisture loss, and let chloroplasts fix the incoming CO₂ straight into a three-carbon compound—an arrangement that is highly productive in cool, moist environments but becomes wasteful of both water and energy under heat or drought. Daylight prompts guard-cells to open the stomata, admitting CO₂ into the leaf. The gas diffuses through intercellular air spaces to the mesophyll chloroplasts. There, the enzyme RuBisCO (ribulose-,-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) joins each CO₂ molecule to the five-carbon acceptor RuBP and initiates the Calvin–Benson cycle—a reduction sequence that converts CO₂ into triose-phosphate. Those three-carbon units are then assembled into sucrose (sugar) for transport, or into starch and cellulose for storage and structure. Energy economy: Because the CO₂ feeds directly into the Calvin–Benson cycle—carbon fixation in this context means RuBisCO chemically attaches inorganic CO₂ to RuBP—no anatomical pump or temporal storage is required. As a result, the leaf invests only three molecules of ATP (the cell’s universal energy-storage currency) and two of NADPH for every CO₂ fixed, giving C₃ crops excellent energy efficiency under cool, well-watered conditions. Heat-season limitation: When leaf temperature climbs above ≈  °C, the enzyme RuBisCO increasingly reacts with oxygen rather than CO₂, triggering photorespiration—an ATP-consuming salvage pathway that releases some of the carbon the leaf has just fixed back into the atmosphere. Under sustained midsummer heat, photorespiration can waste up to  % of newly made carbohydrate, sharply curbing growth and yield. To offset these losses, a plant must keep its stomata open wider and longer to raise internal CO₂, and that response accelerates water loss, driving higher irrigation demand during hot, dry periods. As state earlier, most common food and landscape plants use the C₃ pathway, with some special exceptions. Here are a few more C₃ examples of common cereal grasses: Cool-season cereals & pseudocereals C₄ photosynthesis evolved independently in at least  plant lineages—predominantly warm-season grasses and a few dicot families—and now dominates many tropical and subtropical grasslands. Because it maintains high carbon-fixation rates at leaf temperatures of – °C while using roughly half the water of comparable C₃ species, C₄ metabolism underpins the prodigious midsummer growth of maize, sorghum, sugarcane and several drought-tolerant turf grasses. Its success rests on a built-in biochemical CO₂ pump that suppresses photorespiration—a wasteful process that consumes energy and releases fixed carbon—even under intense heat and light. How the pathway works: C₄ (spatially separated pump)
C₄ species meet the same challenge by opening their stomata only part-way and splitting the job in space: outer leaf cells capture CO₂ and turn it into a four-carbon acid, then inner leaf cells use that acid to make sugar, a design that slashes water loss and photorespiration in hot, sunny climates. Daylight opens stomata just enough for CO₂ entry, after which the leaf’s two concentric cell layers take over: Energy and nutrient balance: Running the pump costs about two additional ATP per CO₂ fixed compared with the C₃ route. However, the near-elimination of photorespiration means the plant needs far less RuBisCO enzyme, lowering leaf-nitrogen requirements and offsetting part of the extra ATP draw. Performance advantages. Trade-offs. Although the CO₂ pump all but eliminates photorespiration, it is not free: each molecule of CO₂ costs about two extra ATP compared with the C₃ route. When light is weak or air is cool—conditions that limit ATP production—this additional energy demand slows C₄ photosynthesis, making C₄ grasses poor performers in early spring, high altitudes and shaded forest floors. Moreover, the pump depends on Kranz anatomy (two concentric cell layers), a design absent from most plant lineages; as a result, C₄ species are concentrated in grasses and a few dicot families and seldom dominate closed-canopy ecosystems. These examples show the breadth of the C₄ strategy—from staple grains and turf grasses to biomass giants, sedges and even opportunistic dicot weeds—highlighting its importance in hot, sunny and often water-limited environments. Warm-season cereals Forage and turf grasses High-sugar or biomass grasses C₄ sedges Broad-leaf (dicot) C₄ plants Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis is the specialist among the three pathways, used by only ≈  % of vascular species yet dominating some of the harshest plant habitats—hot deserts, fog‐shrouded rock faces, and sun-scorched tree canopies. Vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) is the driving stress there; it is the gap between the moisture a warm leaf could hold at full saturation and the smaller amount present in the surrounding air. A high VPD strips water rapidly from any open pore, so CAM plants avoid that daytime hazard by opening their stomata only at night and storing the absorbed CO₂ as organic acids for use the next day. Typical examples include most fleshy succulents—such as cacti, agaves, aloes, and jade plants—along with pineapple and many (though not all) epiphytic orchids and bromeliads that have also evolved the CAM pathway. How the pathway works: CAM (temporally [time] separated storage)
Succulents and other CAM plants shift the entire routine into two different times of day—stomata open at night to store CO₂ as crassulacean acid, then close by day while that stored CO₂ feeds sugar production— trading rapid growth for extreme drought survival. This nightly-daytime rhythm unfolds in two distinct phases, each with its own set of reactions: Energy and nutrient balance: Two resource considerations determine how efficiently CAM operates compared with C₃ and C₄ systems: Performance advantages: Taken together, the timing strategy gives CAM plants a distinctive ecological edge: Trade-offs: CAM’s night-time storage bottle-necks daily photosynthesis; as a result, CAM plants grow slowly and are easily out-competed in moist, temperate habitats. The pathway also requires succulent anatomy—large vacuoles for acid storage and thick cuticles to minimise cuticular water loss—which limits its occurrence to taxa that can develop such tissues. In mesic (moderately moist habitat) gardens and high-productivity croplands, CAM species remain niche choices, valued more for their drought endurance than for rapid biomass production. CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) allows plants to fix CO₂ at night, reducing water loss during the day. These examples include tropical fruits, desert succulents, epiphytic “air-plants,” and facultative halophytes—highlighting how the CAM pathway enables survival in hot, dry, or epiphytic conditions where daytime stomatal opening would be wasteful of water. Note: CAM is not a single mode but a spectrum. Virtually all stem-succulent cacti (e.g. Carnegiea, Opuntia, Ferocactus, Stenocereus) are obligate CAM throughout their adult life cycle. Their green, photosynthetic stems show classic nocturnal malate accumulation and stomatal opening at night. In contrast, leafy basal cacti such as Pereskia and Rhodocactus are mostly C₃ and show only weak or facultative CAM when severely water-stressed. About –% of Tillandsia species use CAM, especially “atmospheric” epiphytes adapted to dry air and exposed canopies. A minority from cooler, wetter habitats remain C₃ or exhibit weak, facultative CAM. Kalanchoë species include both obligate and facultative CAM plants, well studied in CAM research. Sedum species vary—many temperate species use facultative CAM, switching modes under drought. Crassula spans obligate CAM shrubs, facultative CAM herbs, and some purely C₃ annuals. These plants are notable for their ability to toggle between pathways depending on environmental stress, using C₃ or C₄ by day, and weak to moderate CAM at night under drought or salinity. Often cited in CAM lists, Sansevieria species (now Dracaena) show low-level or facultative CAM, useful in low-light indoor environments due to their ability to fix some CO₂ at night. Plants have evolved three main photosynthetic strategies—C₃, C₄, and CAM—to adapt to different environments. These pathways differ in how they capture and process carbon dioxide, how efficiently they use water, and how much energy (ATP and NADPH) they consume to fix each CO₂ molecule into carbohydrate. Notes: Understanding which photosynthetic pathway a plant uses helps growers decide what to plant in each season, how often to irrigate, and how intensely to fertilise. C₃ crops reward cool-weather planting and frequent watering, C₄ crops excel in hot summers with deeper but less-frequent irrigation, and CAM succulents thrive on minimal water once established. The sections that follow translate those principles into concrete recommendations for species choice, watering schedules, nutrient rates, and heat-wave protection. During the cool half of the year—or whenever daytime highs stay near or below  °C—C₃ vegetables and turf species exploit the low-energy cost of the direct pathway. Crops such as lettuce, spinach, brassicas and most cool-season lawn grasses respond quickly to moderate light and make full use of spring or autumn rainfall. Once daytime highs regularly exceed  °C, the tables turn. Warm-season C₄ plants—maize, sorghum, pearl millet and warm-climate turf grasses—maintain high photosynthetic rates while keeping their stomata only partly open, so they produce more biomass per litre of water. In side-by-side trials, Illinois Extension agronomists have measured up to twice the midsummer dry-matter yield in C₄ forages versus cool-season ryegrass under identical irrigation regimes. Where water is the scarcest resource, CAM succulents take centre stage. Cacti, agaves and many sedums tolerate month-long dry spells because they import CO₂ at night; These plants are ideal to be grouped together in low-maintenance xeriscapes and green-roof installations . Water strategy should mirror the way each pathway balances carbon gain and water loss. By matching irrigation depth and frequency to the plant’s photosynthetic pathway, this can prevent both over-watering of drought-hardy species and under-watering of cool-season vegetables in midsummer, keeping each plant group in its optimum physiological comfort zone, while also minimizing water waste. C₄ plants, such as warm-season grasses and maize, generally require less nitrogen than C₃ plants. In practice, this means you can reduce mid-season nitrogen top-dressing on C₄ pastures or lawns without sacrificing growth or performance. This not only cuts fertilizer costs but also lowers the risk of nutrient runoff or leaching, especially in sandy soils or during wet weather. The reason is biochemical: C₄ leaves contain and require less of the nitrogen-rich enzyme RuBisCO (which drives the first step in the cycle that converts CO₂ into sugars during photosynthesis) because their internal CO₂-concentrating mechanism keeps this enzyme operating efficiently. As a result, C₄ plants can maintain high photosynthetic rates with leaf nitrogen concentrations up to % lower than those of C₃ plants under similar conditions. CAM succulents—such as jade plants, aloes, and agaves—by contrast, grow slowly and store water in thickened leaves or stems. They require only light, infrequent feeding, typically no more than a quarter-strength balanced fertiliser once per warm season. Overfeeding can damage their roots or promote soft, weak growth. Their low nutrient demand reflects both their slow growth and the energy cost of running photosynthesis primarily at night. When an unexpected spell of  °C+ weather hits a C₃ vegetable patch: These measures stabilise internal CO₂ levels and reduce water stress without saturating the soil. By aligning species choice, watering frequency and nutrient inputs with a plant’s photosynthetic pathway, growers can extract the maximum performance from each square metre—whether that means lush lettuces in spring, towering maize in high summer, or a drought-proof succulent garden that thrives on neglect. In conclusion, knowing a plant’s photosynthetic pathway turns theory into practice. C₃ species excel in cool, moist seasons but need frequent watering when it’s hot; C₄ crops thrive on high heat and deep, infrequent irrigation; CAM succulents survive long dry spells with almost no extra water. Identify the pathway, adjust planting time and water schedule accordingly, and you’ll harvest more with less effort and fewer inputs by working with the plants needs and evolutionary adaptations.";Deep Green Permaculture
Parsnip is a biennial plant in the Apiaceae family, closely related to carrots, celery, fennel, and parsley. It is typically grown as an annual vegetable for its edible taproot, which develops during the first year of growth. In the second year, if not harvested, it produces a flowering stalk and sets seed before completing its life cycle. The plant develops a rosette of finely divided, pinnate leaves in its first year, each leaf composed of broad, toothed or lobed leaflets with a bright to dark green color. The foliage resembles that of celery or flat-leaf parsley and emerges from a short crown at the top of the root. The stems are grooved and hollow, particularly in the flowering phase, with a robust vertical growth that reaches . to . meters (. to  feet) tall in its second year. The most distinctive feature of parsnip is its thick, creamy-white, tapered taproot, which can grow – cm (– inches) long depending on soil conditions. It is cylindrical, often with a swollen upper portion that tapers to a fine point. The root has a smooth skin and dense flesh that becomes sweeter after exposure to cold, due to the conversion of starches to sugars. In its second year, parsnip sends up a tall flowering stalk topped with compound umbels of small yellow flowers. These flowers are pollinated by insects and give rise to flat, oval, winged seeds that are light brown in color. These seeds are short-lived and typically remain viable for only one season, making annual seed replacement necessary for reliable germination. Parsnip is adapted to cool temperate climates and requires a long growing season to fully mature. It performs best in deep, loose, stone-free soils where its long taproot can develop unimpeded. While primarily cultivated as a root vegetable, all aboveground parts of the parsnip plant—including leaves and stems—contain chemical compounds called furanocoumarins. These compounds are released when the green tissues are damaged—for example, during harvesting or trimming. If the sap contacts skin and is then exposed to sunlight (specifically ultraviolet light), it can trigger phytophotodermatitis, a painful inflammatory reaction that may cause blistering, rash and long-lasting skin discoloration. Although this reaction is more severe and frequent with wild parsnip, cultivated varieties still carry a risk, particularly in sunny conditions. Gardeners should wear gloves and long sleeves when handling damaged foliage or harvesting plants to prevent accidental exposure. Parsnips are a cool-season crop that thrives in temperatures between –°C (–°F), with optimal growth occurring around –°C (–°F). They grow best when temperatures do not exceed °C (°F). High summer temperatures can reduce growth, decrease quality, and cause bitter or off-flavored roots. Parsnips can tolerate light frosts, and exposure to cold temperatures can enhance their sweetness. They require deep, fertile, well-drained soils rich in organic matter. Consistent moisture is essential, especially during germination and root development. Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers, which can cause excessive top growth and forked roots. Parsnips are best planted in early spring, as they need a long growing season of – weeks to mature. Seeds should be sown directly into the garden – weeks before the average last frost date in spring. In regions with mild winters, planting can occur in late summer for a fall harvest. Seeds germinate best at soil temperatures between –°C (–°F). Germination can be slow, typically taking – days. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Harvest Time: Harvesting Tips: Storage: Parsnips are highly versatile in the kitchen and have long been valued for their sweet, earthy, and slightly nutty flavor. The flavor intensifies after exposure to frost, as cold temperatures convert starches in the root to sugars—a unique characteristic that sets parsnips apart from most other root vegetables. They are commonly used in savory dishes, but their natural sweetness also allows for applications in baking and desserts. The most popular cooking method is roasting, where chopped parsnip pieces are drizzled with oil and baked until caramelized. This brings out their rich, toasty flavor. Parsnips can also be boiled and mashed, often in combination with potatoes or carrots, or served alone as a creamy puree. Steaming or sautéing are good methods for retaining their subtle flavor, especially when used as a side dish or in vegetable medleys. In soups and stews, parsnips are added for both flavor and body. Their starch contributes to thickening the broth, making them an ideal addition to root vegetable chowders or winter soups. In vegetarian broths, they offer a natural sweetness and depth. They’re also often cubed or shredded and added to casseroles or baked savory pies. For more adventurous uses, grated raw parsnip can be included in slaws or salads, though this is less common due to its fibrous texture. In historical and modern baking, parsnips have been used in cakes, muffins, and quick breads—similar to carrot cake—where they contribute both sweetness and moisture. When preparing parsnips, the root should be peeled, especially if large or mature, as the skin can be tough. The inner core can also become woody in larger roots and is best removed. To preserve their quality, store parsnips in a cool, humid environment like a root cellar or the crisper drawer of a refrigerator. Avoid storing them near ethylene-producing fruits like apples, which can hasten spoilage. In conclusion, parsnips are a rewarding crop for gardeners willing to invest time and care. Their unique flavor and nutritional benefits make them a valuable addition to any garden.;Deep Green Permaculture

In recent decades, antioxidants have garnered significant attention for their health-promoting properties in human nutrition. However, the presence of antioxidants in plants is not merely coincidental nor primarily for human benefit. Instead, plants have evolved sophisticated biochemical mechanisms involving antioxidants primarily for their own survival, functioning as vital defenses against environmental stressors. This article explores the intricate biochemical relationships between plant stress responses, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the antioxidant defense systems that plants utilize to sustain their cellular integrity and health. Plants encounter numerous environmental stresses, including intense light, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, temperature extremes (heat or cold), drought, salinity, and chemical herbicides. Exposure to these stressors significantly increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)—highly reactive molecules derived from oxygen metabolism. Many individuals are familiar with the concept of harmful free radicals—molecules that possess an unpaired electron, making them highly unstable and reactive. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a subset (or type) of free radicals that contain oxygen and accept electrons from other molecules, making them primarily act as oxidizing agents, leading to oxidative damage in living cells. The normal metabolic processes of respiration and photosynthesis that occur within plant cells produce small quantities of highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules—collectively called reactive oxygen species (ROS)—which are toxic by-products of these otherwise vital pathways. The primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in plant cells include: At lower concentrations, these reactive oxygen species (ROS) are necessary for various cellular signaling and developmental processes in plants. They function as key signaling molecules that enable cells to rapidly respond to different stimuli. ROS play a role in the control and regulation of biological processes such as growth, the cell cycle, programmed cell death, hormone signaling, biotic and abiotic stress reactions and development. The way they function in the critical role of plant stress response is by altering the expression of defensive genes which stimulate the plant’s defense mechanisms in order to induces tolerance to extreme environmental conditions and increase plant resilience overall. However, at higher concentrations, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels cause abnormal cell signaling, cell damage through oxidative stress, and oxidative cell death. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly reactive chemically, and are known to damage DNA, lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins, the building blocks of living cells. They cause damage to plant cell organelles and membrane components (internal cell structures) and interrupt various metabolic pathways (series of linked biochemical reactions occurring within a cell) until oxidative cell death occurs. Without effective antioxidant defense mechanisms, extensive cell damage accumulates, potentially leading to the decline and eventual death of the plant. To counteract the harmful effects of ROS, plants have evolved complex antioxidant defense systems, categorized broadly into enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Antioxidants are substances that prevent or minimize oxidative damage by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS). These systems work in complementary ways to maintain cellular redox balance. This balance, known as ROS homeostasis, is achieved when ROS production is matched by ROS scavenging through antioxidant compounds and enzymes. Enzymes are specialized proteins that catalyze (speed up) biochemical reactions without being consumed in the process. In the context of antioxidant defense, enzymatic antioxidants catalytically convert harmful ROS into less reactive or harmless molecules. This distinguishes them from non-enzymatic antioxidants, which act by directly donating electrons to neutralize ROS but are often used up in the process. Non-enzymatic antioxidants include: These antioxidants function primarily by donating electrons to ROS, neutralizing them and converting them into less harmful molecules. Key antioxidant enzymes include: The antioxidant defenses of plants operate at multiple, sequential yet overlapping levels, involving both antioxidant molecules and enzymes. These levels include radical prevention, radical scavenging, repair of oxidative damage, and adaptive responses to oxidative stress. Each of these defense levels plays a specific role in mitigating oxidative damage, and together they form a layered, multi-tiered response system, as outlined below: The antioxidant defenses of plants can be described as operating at multiple sequential levels: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form mutualistic associations with the roots of most terrestrial plants, facilitating improved nutrient and water uptake. In addition to these well-known benefits, AM fungi play a key role in enhancing the plant’s antioxidant defense system. This is achieved by stimulating the expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and various peroxidases, which help to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced under stress. This symbiosis not only improves the plant’s physiological tolerance to abiotic stresses—such as drought, salinity, and heavy metal toxicity—but also mitigates ROS-induced cellular damage, particularly in root and shoot tissues. The presence of AM fungi often leads to reduced lipid peroxidation and stabilized cellular membranes, demonstrating a direct role in moderating oxidative stress. These effects reflect a highly integrated response, in which the plant’s endogenous (internal) antioxidant system is reinforced by (external) microbial interaction, highlighting the ecological and functional interdependence between plants and soil microorganisms in stress adaptation. Antioxidants mitigate oxidative stress by: Key antioxidant molecules such as ascorbic acid and glutathione, linked through the ascorbate–glutathione cycle, function as vital redox buffers. This cycle plays a central role in detoxifying the hydrogen peroxide ROS in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and the cytosol. Ascorbate reduces hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) to water (H₂O) via ascorbate peroxidase, and is regenerated through a series of enzymatic steps involving glutathione. This continuous cycle maintains cellular redox homeostasis (a balance of oxidation and reduction reactions within a cell, which is crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and health), allowing plants to modulate ROS levels dynamically and support both stress tolerance and signalling. In conclusion, plants employ sophisticated antioxidant defense systems as critical adaptations to survive and thrive amidst environmental stress. Understanding these biochemical mechanisms underscores the importance of antioxidants beyond their human health benefits, highlighting their fundamental role in plant resilience and survival strategies.;Deep Green Permaculture
Collard greens (also known as tree cabbage or non-heading cabbage) are a leafy, non-heading, wild form of cabbage that is a biennial plant grown as annuals for their large, smooth, oval leaves. Plants have an erect, upright form and typically reach – cm (– ft) in height, forming a loose rosette rather than a firm head. Stems are thick, branching at times, and the leaves have prominent veins with broad petioles (leaf stems). The leaves can be dark green to bluish-green and develop a waxy coating that helps them retain moisture. If allowed to overwinter or bolt, collards produce small, yellow, four-petaled flowers typical of the Brassica family, followed by slender seed pods containing round seeds. Though technically biennial, most gardeners harvest leaves throughout the growing season and do not allow the plant to flower unless saving seeds. Collard leaves can be eaten raw when they are small and tender, while the larger, tougher, more mature leaves can be cooked, stewed, braised, stir-fried, or made into chips much like kale. Collard greens are a cool‐season crop that thrives in temperatures ranging from - °C (- °F). Once established, plants tolerate light frosts and even withstand lows to -. °C ( °F), frequently developing a sweeter flavor after exposure to frost. Seeds will germinate in soils as cool as  °C ( °F) and plants will continue productive growth when monthly averages reach  °C ( °F). However, sustained temperatures above  °C ( °F) can reduce both yields, toughen leaves, cause leaves to develop a stronger flavor and trigger premature bolting (flowering and going to seed). Plants prefer well-drained, fertile soil enriched with organic matter, with regular watering to maintain constant moisture levels. In regions with hot summers, sowing seeds in early spring or late summer is best, so plants mature during the cooler weather. In cooler climates, sow seeds directly into the soil after the danger of frost has passed, or start seeds indoors – weeks before the last frost. The optimum soil temperatures for germination are generally – °C (– °F). Seedlings started indoors (or in a cold frame) are ready to be transplanted when they have – true leaves, which indicates that they have reached a sufficient level of growth to adapt effectively to outdoor conditions. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Harvest Time: Harvesting Tips: Storage: Collard greens are a culinary mainstay in many parts of the world, most famously in Southern U.S. cuisine. Slow simmering is a classic preparation, often combined with smoked meats (like ham hocks or bacon) and seasoned with onions, garlic, or chilies. This cooking style mellows their hearty flavor and renders the fibrous leaves tender. In other regions, lighter cooking methods are popular. For instance, collard greens may be sautéed with olive oil and garlic or briefly blanched before adding to stews, providing an earthy balance to robust flavors. Beyond these methods, collards’ sturdy leaves make them suitable as wraps for fillings—an alternative to tortillas or cabbage leaves. Lightly steaming or blanching them softens the leaves, making them pliable enough to roll around grains, proteins, or vegetables. When fresh and young, collard greens are tender enough to be thinly sliced into salads or slaws. Combining them with bright dressings or citrus highlights their slightly sweet, earthy character. Collards can also be chopped and added to soups, lending body and nutrients to broths. Because they hold up well under heat, they won’t disintegrate quickly, giving soups a heartiness. Pairing them with beans, tomatoes, or root vegetables creates a satisfying, nourishing meal. The mild flavor accommodates various seasonings, from smoked paprika to curry blends, making collard greens a versatile addition to global cuisines. Whether braised in a rustic Southern dish or folded into a modern fusion recipe, collards bring a nutritious, fibrous depth to the table. In conclusion, collard greens are a resilient, easy-to-grow crop that can adapt to a wide range of climates. With proper soil preparation, consistent watering, and timely harvest, you can enjoy a season-long supply of nutritious leaves that enrich your kitchen with everything from classic comfort foods to inventive new recipes.;Deep Green Permaculture
"Mizuna is a cool-season leafy green with ling, thin, crip, upright growing stems and finely serrated, feathery leaves that form dense rosettes. There are several varieties of mizuna with different colored stems and leaves, including light green stems with darker green leaves, purple stems and green leaves, or green stems and dark purple leaves. The leaves have a mild mustard flavor, somewhat similar to arugula (rocket) but less peppery. Although mizuna is technically a mustard, its flavor is so mild that it is used as salad leaf green in salad mixes. Plants generally reach – cm (– in) in height and can spread similarly wide when grown to maturity. Under favorable conditions, mature mizuna plants may produce small, yellow, four-petaled flowers typical of the Brassicaceae family. If allowed to set seed, slender pods (siliques) follow. While often cultivated as an annual for baby greens or full-sized leaves, mizuna in milder climates can behave like a short-lived biennial, bolting once day lengths extend and temperatures rise. Mizuna is a cool-season crop that thrives in temperatures ranging from about –°C (–°F), with the optimal temperature being around –°C (–°F). Mizuna is remarkably tolerant of both heat and cold, enabling you to extend your harvest season from late spring/early summer through the autumn and even into early winter in most years. it is tolerant of light frosts and very slow to bolt, making it an ideal choice for early spring or autumn planting, to avoid bolting (going to seed) in summer heat. It is sensitive to high temperatures above °C (°F), , which can prompt flowering and reduce leaf quality, and typically bolts when summer temperatures consistently reach around °C (°F) or higher, but you can start growing it again in early fall as the weather cools. It prefers slightly moist, well-drained, nutrient-rich soil with full sunlight but can also grow in partial shade. Water regularly to keep the soil moist but avoid waterlogging to prevent root rot or mildew. Mizuna can tolerate slightly alkaline soil. In cooler climates or regions with short growing seasons, starting seeds indoors – weeks before the last frost date and transplanting them outdoors once temperatures stabilize can yield earlier harvests. This is rarely done though, as mizuna seed is most commonly directly planted. The optimal temperature range for seed germination is about °C to °C (°F to °F), although the seeds can begin to sprout at temperatures as low as approximately °C (°F). seedlings emerge after around  to  days. The seeds have a long storage life, and can be saved for  years. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Harvest Time: Harvesting Methods: . Harvesting the Entire Plant at Once . Cut-and-Come-Again (Partial Harvest) . Individual Leaf Harvest (Leaf-by-Leaf) Harvesting Tips: Storage: Produce New Plants From: Seeds Mizuna’s mildly spicy, crisp leaves lend themselves to numerous culinary applications. Often served raw, these feathery greens add a delicate mustard note to salads. Because mizuna is less pungent than some other Asian greens, it’s popular in mesclun mixes where it brings subtle pepperiness without overwhelming other flavors. Some cooks pair mizuna with sweeter dressings or fruits to balance its mild bite; think of a salad with sliced pears, toasted nuts, and a tangy vinaigrette. When briefly wilted, mizuna maintains a tender texture. Add it at the last moment to soups or stir-fries for a bright, leafy finish. In Japanese cuisine, mizuna is sometimes used in nabemono (hot-pot dishes) or lightly pickled with other vegetables. A quick sauté with garlic, sesame oil, or soy sauce transforms it into a simple, nutrient-rich side dish. Because it cooks faster than heartier greens like kale or collards, watch carefully to avoid overcooking and preserving its vibrant color. For a fusion spin, chop mizuna into omelets or quiches for a mild mustard accent, or toss it into pasta dishes with sautéed onions, mushrooms, and olive oil. It can also be blended into pestos or sauces in small amounts to add complexity alongside basil or parsley. Despite its slender appearance, mizuna is adaptable—equally at home in warm or cold recipes. Whether used raw in salads or briefly cooked for a subdued peppery tone, mizuna offers a flavorful, flexible addition to the kitchen repertoire. In conclusion, mizuna is a fast-growing, cold-hardy green that fits effortlessly into home gardens. By planting in mild conditions, ensuring consistent moisture, and harvesting regularly, you can enjoy multiple flushes of its finely serrated leaves. Given its broad culinary range—from fresh salads to quick stir-fries—mizuna stands out as a reliable, adaptable leafy green for both novice and experienced gardeners.";Deep Green Permaculture
"Regrowing pineapples from pineapple tops is a fun and educational way to grow a tropical plant right at home. Pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a member of the bromeliad family, known for its unique flowering structure and sweet, juicy fruit. Pineapples are slow growing plants. While you won’t get a new pineapple overnight—most plants grown this way take two to three years or more to bear fruit—the process is surprisingly straightforward and can add a striking, ornamental accent to your home or garden. Read on for a step-by-step guide, along with useful tips and potential pitfalls to watch out for. A healthy, green top is more likely to produce strong roots and robust new growth. Pineapples with damaged or decaying leaves can harbor diseases or pests. Fun Fact: Pineapple “fruit” is actually many small fruits produced by individual flowers on the pineapple’s core fused together. After fruiting, the main plant can also produce suckers (side shoots) which can be removed and planted to grow additional pineapple plants. Exposing the stem encourages new root growth. Allowing the cut end to dry (or callus) slightly reduces the chance of fungal and bacterial infections. You can start rooting your pineapple in water or directly in soil: Rooting Pineapple in Water Method Rooting Pineapple in Soil Method Pineapple tops can root readily in water or soil. The water method makes it easier to monitor root development, while the direct-soil method avoids transplant shock later. Proper root development ensures that the pineapple top will continue growing in its new environment. Good drainage is critical for preventing root rot. Pineapples usually thrive in warm, tropical or subtropical climates. They are sensitive to cold and cannot tolerate freezing temperatures. While pineapples can adapt to a variety of indoor or outdoor environments, maintaining the right balance of warmth, humidity, and sunlight is critical for their robust growth and eventual fruit production. Place the pot in a sunny spot. Pineapple plants need at least – of bright, direct sunlight each day, or supplemental grow lights (indoors/greenhouse) to maximize growth and fruiting potential if light is insufficient. Water regularly but sparingly—allow the top inch of soil to dry before watering again. Overwatering can lead to root rot. Because pineapples’ water requirements fluctuate with temperature and growth cycles, adjusting your watering schedule seasonally is essential for healthy, consistent development. Plants need nutrients for growth. Feed your plant with a balanced, general-purpose water-soluble fertilizer every every – weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). Some gardeners use a bromeliad fertilizer or a balanced (-- or --) blend. Be careful to avoid over-fertilizing, as it can burn the roots. Keep temperatures in the range of -°C (-°F). Pineapple plants are sensitive to frost and cold drafts. In addition to warm temperatures, proper humidity levels play a vital role in keeping pineapple plants healthy and preventing stress or leaf damage. Moderate to high humidity is beneficial. Pineapples generally prefer relative humidity levels of –% or higher. Pineapples are tropical plants and thrive in warm, sunny conditions. Regular, light watering and balanced nutrition help ensure healthy foliage and eventual fruit production. Pineapple plants typically fruit within .– years, and only one fruit is produced per pineapple plant. Flowering and fruiting can be naturally encouraged by ensuring the plant receives adequate light, water, and nutrients. It’s also possible to artificially induce flowering use the “apple method”. Some gardeners place a ripe apple in a plastic bag around the pineapple’s leaves for a week to release ethylene gas, a natural plant hormone that can trigger flowering. This method can be tricky and is best done when the plant is mature (usually after a year or more of growth). When growing pineapples, it’s also important to be patient: Once the plant flowers, it takes about  months for the fruit to mature. If you’re lucky, your pineapple will eventually flower and produce fruit! But when is it ready to eat? Your pineapple is ready to harvest when the fruit is golden yellow or orange in color, the leaves pull out easily with a gentle tug, and the fruit emits a sweet, fragrant aroma that indicates ripeness. This transformation signifies that the pineapple has reached its peak flavor and sweetness, making it ideal for consumption. Examine the fruit’s appearance; it should be plump and have a slight give when gently squeezed. To harvest, cut the pineapple fruit from the plant using a sharp knife, Many gardeners usually leave a short section (about an inch) of that stalk (or “stem”) attached to the bottom of the pineapple to make handling easier and minimize damage to the fruit. After fruiting, the mother pineapple plant may decline, but it often produces slips or suckers (also called pups) at the base—these are new baby plants. These offshoots can be carefully separated and replanted in fertile soil, typically reaching maturity more quickly than pineapples grown from crown cuttings. With proper sunlight and watering, you can establish a continuous cycle of growth and harvest, ensuring a sustainable source of fresh pineapples right in your garden. Regrowing a pineapple from a store-bought pineapple top is an enjoyable project that offers a first-hand look into tropical horticulture. While it may take a couple of years—or longer—before your plant is ready to produce fruit, nurturing a pineapple crown can be very rewarding. Keep in mind that pineapples are tropical plants needing warm temperatures, bright light, and well-draining soil. If you do not live in a tropical or subtropical climate, you can still raise them indoors or in a greenhouse—much like other warm-climate houseplants—though successfully producing fruit requires more dedication and expertise. While ornamental houseplants are largely grown for their foliage and rarely flower, growing a pineapple plant to bear fruit is a far greater horticultural achievement. If it never fruits indoors, you will still have a striking ornamental bromeliad, appreciated for its unique foliage and structure. If your main goal is to harvest fruit sooner, buying an established pineapple plant from a reputable nursery is the faster route. Otherwise, savor the process of watching a humble kitchen scrap transform into a vibrant, ornamental bromeliad—and possibly even produce its own sweet pineapple someday.

"Boston Ferns, scientifically known as Nephrolepis exaltata, are a classic favorite among houseplant enthusiasts for their lush, arching fronds and elegant appearance. These ferns can add a touch of verdant beauty to any indoor space, making them a popular choice for hanging baskets and pots. Despite their somewhat finicky reputation, Boston Ferns can thrive with proper care and attention. This guide covers everything you need to know about Boston Fern care, ensuring your fern remains healthy and vibrant. Scientific Name: Nephrolepis exaltata Common Names: Boston Fern Origin: Native to the humid, tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Florida, the West Indies, Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. Over time, it has been introduced worldwide due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability. Description: The plant is characterized by its long, graceful fronds, which can grow up to m ( feet) in length. The fronds are composed of numerous small leaflets, giving the plant a full, feathery appearance. Boston Ferns are typically grown as houseplants, but they can also be used in outdoor gardens in suitable climates. Benefits: Besides their ornamental appeal, Boston Ferns are effective at purifying indoor air. They are known to remove toxins such as formaldehyde and xylene, contributing to a healthier indoor environment. Watering Needs: Boston Ferns prefer consistently moist soil. Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels dry, ensuring even moisture throughout the pot. During the growing season (spring and summer), you may need to water more frequently, while in the fall and winter, reduce watering slightly. It’s crucial to avoid letting the soil dry out completely or become waterlogged. Soil and Potting: A well-draining, peat-based potting mix is ideal for Boston Ferns. Use a premium quality general purpose potting mix will provide the necessary moisture retention with good drainage. Ensure the pot has adequate drainage holes to prevent water accumulation at the bottom. Repotting should be done every - years to refresh the soil and accommodate growth. When repotting, be gentle with the roots to avoid damage. Light Requirements and Lux Levels: Boston Ferns thrive in bright, indirect light but can adapt to various lighting conditions. Using a lux meter to measure light intensity can help you determine the best spot for your Boston Fern, ensuring it receives the appropriate amount of light without being exposed to harsh direct sunlight. Temperature and Humidity: Boston Ferns thrive in warm, humid environments. They prefer temperatures between °C to °C (°F and °F) and high humidity levels, ideally above %. To increase humidity, consider placing the plant on a pebble tray filled with water, using a humidifier, or misting the fronds regularly. Fertilization and Pruning: Feed your Boston Fern with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half strength every - weeks during the growing season, reducing feeding in the autumn and winter when the plant’s growth slows, or use a solid slow-release solid fertilizer that comes in pellets or prills (little round balls) in spring. Pruning is minimal; simply remove any brown or dead fronds to keep the plant looking healthy. Regularly trim back older fronds to encourage new growth. Boston Ferns (Nephrolepis exaltata) are popular houseplants known for their lush, feathery fronds. Propagating these ferns can be done through two primary methods: division and spores. Division is the most common and easiest method for home gardeners. Propagating by spores is more complex and time-consuming, typically used by more experienced gardeners or commercial growers. Here’s a detailed guide on how to propagate Boston Ferns using these methods. Step : Prepare Your Tools and Materials Step : Remove the Plant from Its Pot – Gently remove the Boston Fern from its current pot. Turn the pot upside down while supporting the plant with your hand, and tap the bottom to loosen the root ball. Step : Divide the Root Ball – Place the fern on a tarp or old newspaper. Examine the root ball and look for natural divisions or clumps of fronds. Use your hands or a clean, sharp knife to carefully separate the plant into smaller sections. Each section should have several fronds and a portion of the root system. Step : Repot the Divisions – Fill new pots with fresh potting mix. Place each division into its own pot, ensuring that the roots are well-covered with soil. Firmly press the soil around the base of the plant to provide support. Leave some space at the top of the pot for watering. Step : Water and Care for the New Plants – Water the newly potted divisions thoroughly, ensuring the soil is evenly moist. Place the plants in a location with bright, indirect light and maintain high humidity levels to encourage growth. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Step : Collect Spores – Spores are found on the underside of the fronds, in small brownish spots called sori. To collect spores, place a piece of paper or a paper bag under a mature frond and gently shake or tap it. The spores will fall onto the paper. Step : Prepare a Growing Medium – Fill a shallow tray or container with a sterilized, peat-based potting mix or a mix of peat moss and sand. Moisten the medium thoroughly with distilled water. Step : Sow the Spores – Evenly distribute the collected spores over the surface of the moistened growing medium. Do not cover the spores with soil, as they need light to germinate. Step : Create a Humid Environment – Cover the tray or container with a clear plastic lid, plastic wrap, or a clear plastic bag to maintain high humidity. Place the container in a warm location with indirect light. Step : Monitor and Maintain – Keep the growing medium consistently moist by misting with distilled water as needed. After a few weeks to a couple of months, the spores will germinate, forming a thin green film called prothalli. Step : Transplant the Prothalli – Once the prothalli develop small, fern-like fronds and roots, they can be carefully transplanted into individual pots with fresh potting mix. Continue to provide high humidity and indirect light as the young ferns grow. By following these propagation methods and care tips, you can successfully propagate Boston Ferns and enjoy their lush, green fronds in various parts of your home or share them with friends and family. Boston Ferns can be susceptible to pests such as spider mites, mealybugs, and aphids. Regularly inspect your plant and treat any infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Common issues include yellowing or browning fronds, which can indicate low humidity, improper watering, or nutrient deficiencies. Ensuring consistent moisture and humidity levels, along with proper fertilization, can help prevent these problems. With their lush, arching fronds, Boston Ferns make excellent decorative plants for hanging baskets, shelves, and plant stands. They can add a touch of greenery to any room and are particularly well-suited to bathrooms and kitchens, where humidity levels are typically higher. Their elegant appearance also makes them ideal for creating a natural, serene atmosphere in living rooms and bedrooms. In summary, Boston Ferns are a beautiful addition to any indoor garden, offering both aesthetic appeal and air-purifying benefits. While they may require a bit more attention than some other houseplants, the effort is well worth it for the lush, vibrant fronds they provide. By following the care guidelines outlined in this article, you can ensure your Boston Fern thrives, bringing life and beauty to your indoor spaces. Whether you’re a seasoned plant enthusiast or a beginner, Boston Ferns are a rewarding choice that will add a touch of classic elegance to your home.";Deep Green Permaculture
"Antioxidants have captured widespread attention for their vital role in promoting health and preventing cellular damage. They are frequently featured in nutritional guides, scientific research, and on product labels, yet questions often persist: What exactly are antioxidants? How do they work? And which foods and supplements provide the highest concentrations of these beneficial compounds? This article provides a comprehensive exploration of these topics by examining: Antioxidants are molecules capable of inhibiting the oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation can be defined as the loss of electrons by an atom, molecule, or ion. The chemical process of oxidation generates free radicals—unstable molecules with one or more unpaired electrons. Under normal physiological conditions (normal functioning of the body and its systems), free radicals form as by-products of cellular metabolism, immune responses, and exposure to external factors (e.g., pollution, UV radiation). High levels of free radicals are harmful though, and and are responsible for premature aging and play a role in cardiovascular disease. degenerative diseases such as cataracts, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer. Generally speaking, antioxidants either neutralize free radicals or prevent their formation. Key antioxidants found in foods include: Starting first with a more general and accessible explanation, antioxidants work in various ways to protect the body—they help neutralize free radicals or stop them from forming by donating electrons, or by binding to metals. They also work by breaking down free radicals and associated molecules to remove them, in the following ways: Oxidative stress arises when free-radical levels exceed the body’s natural antioxidant defenses, resulting in potential damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA. Chronic oxidative stress is linked to accelerated aging and heightened vulnerability to various chronic conditions. By donating electrons or chelating metal ions, dietary antioxidants help maintain a balance that protects cells from these damaging processes. Research consistently demonstrates that diets abundant in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds—key sources of antioxidants—are associated with healthier inflammatory profiles and a reduced incidence of chronic diseases. Such protection is observed in population studies and supported by laboratory evidence showing how antioxidants stabilize harmful free radicals before they can inflict cellular damage. A growing body of data underscores the beneficial effects of antioxidants on heart and blood vessel function. Polyphenols (e.g., those found in berries, cocoa, and certain teas) contribute to: Large-scale observational research and meta-analyses have documented an inverse relationship between diets rich in antioxidant polyphenols and the incidence of cardiovascular events. These findings also suggest that combining multiple antioxidants (e.g., vitamin C, vitamin E, polyphenols, and carotenoids) may produce synergistic cardioprotective benefits. Extensive preclinical research has established that many antioxidant compounds can inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells, induce apoptosis (programmed cell death), and reduce tumor angiogenesis. For instance, green tea flavonoids—particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)—show consistent anticancer activity in in vitro and animal models, ranging from limiting tumor growth to suppressing metastatic processes. Other antioxidant compounds found in foods like berries (anthocyanins) and cruciferous vegetables (isothiocyanates) exhibit similarly robust mechanisms, including DNA protection and anti-inflammatory effects that impede cancer progression. While human clinical evidence continues to evolve, especially regarding optimal dosages and long-term outcomes, many findings indicate that antioxidant-rich dietary patterns are linked to lower rates of certain cancers. Ongoing clinical trials aim to refine the role of specific antioxidants (or combinations thereof) in cancer prevention and adjunctive therapy. Antioxidants are pivotal for brain health, as neurons are especially sensitive to oxidative damage. Research shows that diets high in antioxidants like vitamin E, flavonoids (in grapes, berries, and cocoa), and carotenoids (in leafy greens) can help preserve cognitive function and protect neuronal structures. Compounds like EGCG and resveratrol cross the blood-brain barrier, mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation within neural tissues. Evidence from observational studies links higher antioxidant intake with better cognitive performance and a lower incidence of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease). Laboratory investigations confirm that certain antioxidants reduce aggregation of neurotoxic proteins and promote the survival of healthy neurons, offering substantial promise for preventive strategies. Clinical trials continue to clarify dosages and combinations most beneficial for neurological protection. Skin Health
Antioxidants are central to maintaining skin integrity, as the skin regularly encounters oxidative stress from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, environmental pollutants, and other external factors. Compounds like vitamin C, vitamin E, and polyphenols found in green tea, cocoa, and berries help: Immune Function
A well-functioning immune system depends on a steady supply of antioxidants to safeguard immune cells and signaling molecules. Dietary antioxidants can: Below is a list of  notable antioxidant-rich foods, drawn from various published sources (including older USDA ORAC data). Although the USDA discontinued its ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) database in —citing that in vitro (laboratory test tube) results don’t necessarily reflect in vivo (in-body) effects—these foods listed below are consistently cited by multiple research groups for their notable antioxidant content. Note: This list is not ranked by antioxidant levels, since these values can vary with growing conditions, storage, processing, and differences among cultivars (plant varieties). Also, a high lab-measured antioxidant score doesn’t always translate into equivalent benefits in the body due to differences in absorption and metabolism of antioxidant compounds.. Red kidney beans are highlighted separately for their especially high antioxidant content, but many other legumes—like black beans, pinto beans, and lentils—also offer similarly robust antioxidant benefits. Common varieties with notable antioxidant levels include thyme, rosemary, basil, sage, and marjoram. These herbs are classic to Mediterranean cuisine and share similar flavor profiles and antioxidant properties, making the category both accurate and cohesive. Antioxidants naturally occur in many foods, but an additional source is through supplements. Listed below is a broad overview of supplements known for their antioxidant properties: In this section, we delve into the cellular mechanisms by which antioxidants guard our bodies against oxidative damage. Although “antioxidant” is a broad term encompassing various compounds, most experts agree that these molecules mainly work in two ways. The following subsections provide detailed examples and explanations of these two fundamental modes of action. As we have mentioned them in prior sections, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are highly reactive molecules containing oxygen, produced both as by-products of normal cell metabolism, occurring naturally within cells (e.g., during mitochondrial respiration).and via external factors such as ultraviolet radiation, environmental toxins, and cigarette smoke. They can be broadly classified into two categories: free-radical ROS—molecules with unpaired electrons, making them extremely reactive (e.g., superoxide anion [O₂⁻·], hydroxyl radical [·OH]—and non-radical ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide [H₂O₂]​, which do not contain unpaired electrons but can readily generate or participate in radical-forming reactions. This distinction matters because free radicals directly attack biomolecules by “stealing” electrons, while non-radical ROS can transition into free radicals under suitable conditions, indirectly perpetuating oxidative stress. An essential takeaway is that when ROS levels exceed the cell’s antioxidant defenses, they can cause widespread oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins. Even though some ROS generation is part of normal cellular processes—such as mitochondrial respiration—excess amounts or inadequate defense (for instance, due to poor diet or excessive exposure to pollutants) can tip the balance toward harmful levels of oxidative stress. This relationship underscores the importance of antioxidants, which help stabilize or diminish ROS, thereby mitigating potential cellular and tissue damage. While the significance of ROS-induced damage to DNA and proteins is relatively straightforward to understand, the mechanisms involved and their implications are profound. When ROS attack DNA—the cell’s genetic blueprint—they can cause base modifications, strand breaks, and cross-linking, which in turn may result in mutations during replication. Such DNA damage, if unrepaired or misrepaired, can accumulate over time and contribute to the development of cancer and age-related genetic disorders. Similarly, oxidative damage to proteins affects their structure and function. ROS can modify amino acid residues, leading to misfolded proteins that lose their enzymatic activity or structural stability. This protein dysfunction can impair critical cellular processes, disrupt cellular signaling pathways, and even trigger the formation of toxic protein aggregates—a common feature in various neurodegenerative conditions. Although the impact of ROS on lipids—particularly through lipid peroxidation—is less immediately apparent, it is equally detrimental, as it compromises cell membrane integrity and contributes to chronic inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) primarily attack unsaturated lipids—particularly those found in cell and organelle membranes throughout the body. Since virtually every cell has a lipid membrane, no tissue is exempt from potential oxidative damage. Below are key sites where lipid peroxidation (the oxidative degradation of lipids) commonly occurs: In conclusion, antioxidants form a critical line of defense against oxidative stress by stabilizing free radicals and supporting overall cellular health. A diet emphasizing diverse, antioxidant-rich foods—such as dark chocolate, nuts, berries, beans, and green tea—can offer broad health benefits, potentially aiding in the maintenance of cardiovascular health, healthy aging, and immune function. While in vitro measurements (those done in a laboratory outside of the body of living things) like the FDA Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of Selected Food database have helped identify foods high in antioxidant capacity, real-world health outcomes also depend on factors like bioavailability, gut microbiome interactions, and the interplay with other nutrients. For those looking to optimize their dietary antioxidant intake, consider rotating through the variety of foods listed above and pairing them with balanced macronutrients (fats, proteins and carbohydrates). As research continues to evolve, these antioxidant powerhouses remain foundational to many science-backed nutrition recommendations.";Deep Green Permaculture
"Horseradish is a hardy perennial herb grown for its pungent, fleshy taproot. It typically produces a rosette of coarse, lanceolate leaves (spear-shaped—longer than wide, tapering to a point, and sometimes widest at the base) that can reach – cm (– ft) in height. The lower leaves are large and oblong with scalloped edges, while upper leaves become narrower. Flowering stems may rise above the foliage in late spring or early summer, bearing small, white, four-petaled flowers in loose clusters. The seed pods are small, elongated silicles, though most horseradish is propagated via root cuttings rather than seeds. Although horseradish is perennial, the above-ground foliage dies back in cold weather, while the taproot survives, remaining dormant underground during winter. When temperatures rise in spring, new growth sprouts from the root crown, producing new leaves. Below ground, the main root can penetrate deeply, with lateral (side) offshoots sprouting new plants if left in the soil. This vigorous growth habit contributes to horseradish’s invasive tendencies if not carefully managed. Horseradish is a warm-season herb thrives in temperate climates, performing best in temperatures around –°C (–°F). Optimal growth and root development typically occur at about –°C (–°F). Horseradish is sensitive to extremely high temperatures above °C (°F), which can slow growth or lead to spindly leaves. While horseradish does best in full sun, it will tolerate partial shade. It required soils that are well-draining, with moderate moisture, and prefers deep, fertile, loamy soil, but will grow just about anywhere. Horseradish also tolerates heavier clay if it is not waterlogged. Roots become misshapen and smaller in size when horseradish is grown in hard, shallow, stony soils. Soil rich in organic matter will produce the largest, most pungent roots, with less branching. In most regions, root cuttings, called “sets,” are planted in early spring or or late autumn. In cooler regions or areas with short growing seasons, planting root cuttings as soon as the soil is workable in spring can speed up establishment. For a typical garden, four to six horseradish plants are sufficient to adequately fulfill the needs of an average family. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Easy to Grow Note: While horseradish readily regrows from root fragments left in the soil, it is NOT invasive in the sense of spreading aggressively throughout a garden bed. It does not have a running or creeping root system like mint; instead, its roots grow in a single clump, making it persistent rather than spreading. Harvest Time: Harvesting Tips: Storage for Immediate Consumption: Storage: Produce New Plants From: Root cuttings (“sets”) Horseradish is propagated from root cuttings, commonly called “sets.” These are small sections of root, usually taken from the side roots of a mature plant. Even tiny root fragments can sprout new plants, but using properly prepared cuttings ensures more reliable growth and uniformity. Because horseradish grows slowly at first, marking the planting site ensures you don’t accidentally disturb the cuttings while weeding. . Select Healthy Roots: . Prepare the Sets: . Prepare the Planting Site: . Plant the Cuttings: . Water Gently and Maintain: . Label or Mark Rows (Optional): Horseradish root is best known as a spicy condiment that brings a fiery punch to dishes. Freshly grated horseradish is pungent—so strong that it often irritates the nose and eyes, similar to onions. Typically, it’s ground and mixed with vinegar or sour cream to create a tangy sauce for roast beef, prime rib, or smoked fish. In Germany and Eastern Europe, grated horseradish (sometimes combined with beet juice to form a milder blend) commonly accompanies sausages, hams, and other cured meats. Due to its intense heat, horseradish is used sparingly—just a tablespoon of freshly ground root can intensify a large serving dish. Cooks sometimes incorporate it into salad dressings or dips for vegetables, adding a sharp, peppery note. You’ll also find it as a key ingredient in cocktail sauce for seafood, pairing well with ketchup, lemon, and Worcestershire sauce. For a subtler effect, many chefs fold a small amount of grated horseradish into mashed potatoes or deviled eggs, injecting a gentle kick without overpowering the dish. Horseradish’s heat dissipates when exposed to prolonged cooking, so it’s generally added near the end of recipes. If you want a pronounced bite, stir it in just before serving. On the other hand, combining it with creamy elements like sour cream, mayonnaise, or yogurt tempers its heat and stretches the flavor throughout a sauce. Whether used to enliven hearty winter meals or to elevate everyday dips, horseradish remains a beloved garnish and condiment across numerous cuisines. In conclusion, horseradish is a vigorous, easy-to-grow perennial prized for its peppery root. With adequate sunlight, fertile soil, and consistent moisture, you can enjoy abundant harvests—just be sure to keep its spreading nature in check. Harvest in the cooler months for maximum pungency, and preserve the root’s intensity by storing and preparing it with care.";Deep Green Permaculture

"Picture this scenario: you’ve just finished reading an article that clearly states, “Putting gravel in the bottom of pots doesn’t improve drainage.” Then you flip to another gardening guide that says, “Before adding soil to your raised bed, line the bottom with coarse gravel or stones to enhance drainage.” Suddenly, you’re left wondering: “Wait, aren’t these two bits of advice completely contradicting each other?” You’re not alone in this confusion. Gardeners often hear both recommendations—no gravel in pots, yet gravel in raised beds—and assume something must be amiss. But the difference, as it turns out, is rooted in how water behaves in large, heavy soil volumes vs. small containers with soilless potting mixes. This article clears up that discrepancy, explaining why and when a drainage layer might be useful in a raised bed (especially on hard surfaces) but does little good in small pots. By the end, you’ll see how the science of soil compaction, water movement, and perched water tables all come together to clarify the mystery. Let’s dig in! When a raised bed is positioned on top of a flat, impermeable surface like concrete or compacted pavement, the escape path for water is limited. Water cannot easily drain away if there is no gap underneath the bottom edge of the raised bed, or if the raised bed has poorly placed drainage outlets. The large volumes of soil in a raised garden bed can trap or slow water movement at the bottom. The way that water drains through soil is by trickling through the air spaces between soil particles which create porosity. Soil is heavy, and has a high bulk density. “Mineral soil” typically has a bulk density in the range of .–. g/cm³ (,–, kg/m³). When you fill a tall, confined bed with a several hundred kilograms to a metric ton or more of soil, the bottom layers will compress under the weight, squeezing soil particles closer together, reducing the size of soil pores that water needs to flow through. Heavily compacted soil restricts drainage by cutting down on the air pockets between soil particles, causing water to become trapped in a waterlogged layer at the base. The trapped water can result in oxygen‐starved (anaerobic) conditions, which harm plant roots and beneficial microorganisms. A “drainage layer” of coarse material (e.g., coarse organic matter, stone, or gravel) can create a zone where water can move more freely into if and only if there is a way for that water to escape beyond the bed. By having a small air gap at the bottom edge of a raised garden bed, or appropriately placed “weep holes” around the perimeter, this can reduce water pooling by allowing the water to escape. A layer of coarse material helps funnel water to those exit points. Note: Many horticultural experts do not always recommend a specific drainage layer in raised beds that sit on native soil with an open bottom. Water typically percolates downward if the subsoil is not heavily compacted. In that scenario, adding a separate coarse layer can sometimes impede drainage (a phenomenon similar to the perched water table in pots) by interrupting the natural wicking that occurs in soil from the raised bed to the ground. Modern potting mixes (soilless media) are generally formulated from peat, coir, bark fines, perlite, or other materials. They aim to maintain a high percentage of air‐filled pore space (often % or more). This design ensures: In containers, water drains until it hits a balance point known as the perched water table—a thin zone at the bottom of the pot where capillary forces hold onto water like a sponge. This occurs regardless of whether there’s gravel or “rocks” below: It’s important to keep in mind that no additional drainage occurs in a potting mix once saturation level is met. Placing rocks or coarse gravel under the potting mix simply raises the bottom of the media and can actually increase the depth of the perched water zone higher up in the pot. As a useful analogy, if you have a saturated sponge, placing it on rocks, on a flat surface, or even suspending it in the air will not squeeze out more water. The moisture held by capillary action will stay. Similarly, potting mix retains a certain level of moisture that depends on the media’s particle size and pore structure, not what’s beneath it. It’s the plant’s roots that actively take up this water, it doesn’t passively drain away. Many university extension documents note that adding a “drainage layer” in small containers does not improve drainage: To quote the article by Linda Chalker-Scott, Ph.D., Extension Horticulturist and Associate Professor,
Puyallup Research and Extension Center, Washington State University – The Myth of Drainage Material in Container Plantings: “Add a layer of gravel or other coarse material in the bottom of containers to improve drainage” (download document here): “Nearly  years ago, soil scientists demonstrated that water does not move easily from layers of finer textured materials to layers of more coarse textured. Since then, similar studies have produced the same results. Additionally, one study found that more moisture was retained in the soil underlain by gravel than that underlain by sand. Therefore, the coarser the underlying material, the more difficult it is for water to move across the interface.“ For more information on drainage in pots and containers, see the following articles: The reason why we treat soil and soilless potting mixes differently in terms of drainage is because they have very different physical properties, and they are used in completely different ways in their application. There are practical, evidence-based approaches, supported by sound science, that we can take to improve drainage in raised garden beds and containers. Below is a concise overview of the most important guidelines for keeping plants healthy, preventing waterlogging, and ensuring the root zone maintains a proper balance of air and moisture. By applying these best practices, gardeners can keep roots healthy, maintain proper moisture levels, and ensure their plants thrive—regardless of whether they’re growing in tall raised beds or small decorative pots.";Deep Green Permaculture
"The Rubber Plant, scientifically known as Ficus elastica, is a popular and eye-catching indoor tree prized for its large, glossy leaves and upright growth habit. Native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant adapts well to indoor environments and can become a striking focal point in any home. As a point of historical interest, Ficus elastica is commonly called the “Rubber Plant” because it produces a milky latex in its sap. People experimented with extracting rubber from it in the th century; however, it never became a major source of natural rubber, a role that fell to Hevea brasiliensis (the Para rubber tree). Despite being a minor historical source of rubber, its latex-laden sap gave rise to the name “Rubber Plant,” and elastica references the latex’s elastic quality. This guide covers everything you need to know about caring for the Rubber Plant, ensuring it thrives and brings a splash of color and interest to your space. Scientific Name: Ficus elastica Common Names: Rubber Plant, Rubber Tree Origin: Native to Southeast Asia, including regions of India, Indonesia, and Malaysia Description: The Rubber Plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that range in color from deep green to burgundy, depending on the variety. It grows upright with a sturdy trunk and can reach impressive heights indoors, often requiring pruning or support as it matures. In its natural habitat, it can grow into a large tree, but indoor specimens are typically kept at a more manageable size. With proper care, the Rubber Plant adds a lush, tropical element to any indoor space. Benefits: Aside from its bold, attractive appearance, the Rubber Plant is known for its air-purifying qualities. It helps filter toxins such as formaldehyde from the indoor environment, contributing to a healthier living space. Its robust nature and ease of maintenance make it a great choice for both experienced plant enthusiasts and beginners looking to add a touch of greenery to their homes. Watering Needs: Rubber Plants prefer consistently moist soil but do not tolerate being waterlogged. Water thoroughly, allowing excess water to drain, then wait until the top inch of soil feels dry before watering again. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure the pot has proper drainage. In the cooler months, reduce watering frequency as the plant’s growth slows. Soil and Potting: A well-draining potting mix is ideal for Rubber Plants. Use a premium quality general purpose potting mix. You can also amended the mix with perlite to further improve drainage though this is usually never necessary. Make sure the pot has drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating at the bottom. Repotting is only necessary every - years or when the plant becomes root-bound. Light Requirements: Rubber Plants thrive in bright, indirect light but can adapt to a range of lighting conditions. Using a lux meter to measure light intensity can help determine the best placement for your Rubber Plant, ensuring it receives the right amount of light without being exposed to harsh direct sunlight. Temperature and Humidity: Rubber Plants thrive in temperatures between °C to °C (°F and °F). They are sensitive to cold drafts and should be kept away from vents or doors where temperatures may drop below °C (°F). Average household humidity levels are generally sufficient, but if the air is particularly dry, consider misting the leaves occasionally or using a humidifier. Fertilization and Pruning: Feed your Rubber Plant with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half strength once a month during the growing season (spring and summer), or use a solid slow-release solid fertilizer that comes in pellets or prills (little round balls) in spring. Reduce feeding in autumn and winter when growth naturally slows. Pruning is best done in late winter or early spring, just before or as the plant begins its most vigorous growth phase; this timing allows the plant to recover quickly and produce new, healthy shoots. To prune, use clean, sharp shears and make cuts just above a leaf node or branching point, which encourages bushier growth and helps maintain a balanced shape. Avoid removing more than one-third of the plant’s foliage at a time to minimize stress, and always remove any yellow, damaged, or diseased leaves as needed. Keep in mind that Ficus elastica produces a milky latex sap when cut, which can irritate skin—wear gloves and wipe away any dripping sap promptly to prevent damage to other leaves or surfaces. Rubber Plants are relatively resistant to pests but can occasionally be affected by spider mites, mealybugs, or scale. Regularly inspect your plant and treat any infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Common issues include leaf drop, which can indicate overwatering or sudden environmental changes, and brown leaf edges, often a sign of low humidity or inconsistent watering. Ensuring consistent moisture levels and providing proper light can help prevent these problems. Rubber Plants can be propagated through stem cuttings. Here’s how: Step : Prepare Your Tools and Materials Step : Take a Cutting – Choose a healthy stem with at least one leaf and a node (the point where a leaf attaches to the stem). Cut a -cm (- inch) section below the node. Step : Prepare the Cutting – Remove any lower leaves, leaving a few at the top. If you choose to use rooting hormone, dip the cut end into the powder to promote root growth. Step : Plant the Cutting – Fill a small pot with fresh, well-draining potting mix. Insert the cutting into the soil, burying at least one node. Gently firm the soil around the base for support. Step : Water and Care for the Cutting – Water the cutting thoroughly and place the pot in a location with bright, indirect light. If desired, cover the pot with a clear plastic bag or plastic wrap to create a humid environment. Keep the soil slightly moist but not soggy. New roots should form within a few weeks, at which point you can remove the cover and continue caring for the young plant as usual. With its broad, glossy leaves and upright growth habit, the Rubber Plant makes a striking statement in any indoor setting. It can serve as an eye-catching floor plant in living rooms, offices, or entryways, adding a touch of natural elegance. Smaller, younger plants can be placed on tables or desks to bring life to smaller spaces. Rubber Plants pair well with other tropical houseplants like Monstera or Philodendron, creating a lush indoor jungle. Their bold foliage also contrasts beautifully with finer-textured plants, offering visual variety. Whether displayed on its own or grouped with other greenery, the Rubber Plant adds a contemporary, sophisticated feel to your home decor. In summary, the Rubber Plant (Ficus elastica) is a resilient and visually appealing houseplant that brings a touch of tropical sophistication to any indoor space. Whether you’re a seasoned plant enthusiast or just starting your indoor garden, the Rubber Plant is a rewarding choice that will continue to grow and enhance your living environment for years to come.";Deep Green Permaculture
Growing strawberries from seeds can be a fun and rewarding project, but it does come with certain challenges and considerations. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to extract seeds from store-bought strawberries, plant them, grow them, and understand the best practices and potential issues. Note: Many strawberry varieties (but mot all) have improved germination rates if the seeds experience a period of cold stratification, a process used to break seed dormancy by exposing seeds to cold and moist conditions, typically in a refrigerator, to simulates the natural winter conditions that some seeds require before they can germinate. For better germination, place dried seeds in a labeled, airtight bag or container in the refrigerator for – weeks. After this chilling period, sow them as described. Try this method if germination rates are low, it’s worth experimenting to see what happens! Strawberry plants typically produce their best harvests for about – years. After this period, the plants become less vigorous, partly due to accumulated diseases in the soil and natural aging of the crown. As a result, gardeners often replace or renew their strawberry beds by either purchasing fresh plants or propagating healthy runners from more productive, younger specimens. Alpine strawberries (Fragaria vesca) also experience a gradual decline in yield, but they may continue producing smaller harvests slightly longer than commercial garden varieties. Recognizing this natural decrease helps prevent disappointment—declining yields after a couple of seasons are normal and not necessarily a result of poor care. While growing strawberries from seeds can be more time-intensive and uncertain compared to purchasing established plants or using runner propagation, it is a rewarding way to experiment with new varieties and experience the full plant life cycle. By following the steps above—along with cold stratification for some types—and monitoring for pests and diseases, you can successfully grow strawberries from store-bought seeds. For quicker and more predictable results, consider buying certified disease-free runners or seedlings from a reputable nursery.;Deep Green Permaculture
Mustard greens are cool-season leafy vegetables known for their peppery taste (a hot mustard flavor) and quick maturity. Depending on the variety, the plants produce either upright rosettes or sprawling clumps of broad, lobed leaves with distinct vein patterns. Mature heights often range between – cm (– ft), though certain cultivars may grow taller. Leaves can appear smooth, ruffled, or frilled, commonly ranging from green to reddish-purple. If allowed to mature fully, mustard greens eventually produce elongated flower stalks bearing small, four-petaled yellow flowers typical of the Brassicaceae family, followed by slender seed pods (siliques). Gardeners often harvest them as baby leaves for milder flavor or wait for mature foliage, which can deliver a sharper bite. Mustard greens are a cool-season crop that thrive in temperatures ranging from –°C (–°F), with an optimal range around –°C (–°F). They require consistent moisture and moderate sunlight, making them best suited for planting in early spring or autumn to avoid summer heat that can trigger bolting. Mustard greens are sensitive to high temperatures above °C (°F), often turning bitter or going to seed prematurely in hot conditions. In cooler regions or short-season areas, starting seeds indoors – weeks before the last frost date can hasten their establishment. While autumn plantings are tolerant of frost, they may be damaged by a hard freeze, particularly if not adequately protected. These leafy greens thrive in well-drained, fertile soil with adequate organic matter, along with regular watering to maintain turgid foliage. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Produce New Plants From: Seeds Mustard greens infuse dishes with a sharp, peppery edge that can range from mild to pungent depending on the variety and growth stage. In many Southern U.S. kitchens, large mustard leaves are slow-cooked with onions, garlic, and cured meats to produce a savory side dish served alongside cornbread. Traditional Asian cuisines—particularly Chinese and Indian—feature mustard greens in pickles, stir-fries, and curries, sometimes blending them with other leafy greens for balance. Lightly wilting mustard greens in a sauté with oil and aromatics can reduce their intensity while retaining a pleasing bite. Baby mustard greens can also be added to salads, offering a slightly spicy accent. When used raw, they pair well with sweet dressings or fruit slices to mellow their pepperiness. Blanching or steaming the leaves also softens the texture and flavor, making them suitable as a base for thicker sauces or in layered casseroles. In Japanese cuisine, mustard greens (like takana) are salted, fermented, or pickled, contributing a piquant element to rice dishes. Meanwhile, in the Middle East, mustard greens sometimes appear in stews or combined with lentils, harnessing their earthy tang. Those looking to experiment can finely chop mustard greens into soups, substituting them for kale or spinach at the end of cooking for a unique taste. Whether braised, boiled, pickled, or eaten raw, mustard greens thrive in myriad recipes. The key is balancing their spicy undertone with complementary flavors—like sweet, acidic, or rich fatty components—to craft a harmonious dish that highlights their distinct, robust character. The seeds of mustard greens are used to flavor brown mustard, which is a popular condiment known for its rich and tangy taste. These tiny seeds, when ground, release a pungent aroma and distinctive flavor that not only adds depth to dishes but also enhances the overall culinary experience. In addition to their use in mustard, the seeds are also rich in nutrients and can be used in various healthful recipes, making them a versatile ingredient in many kitchens worldwide. In conclusion, mustard greens are a productive, fast-growing leafy crop that can easily fit into spring or fall garden plans. By selecting a suitable variety, providing regular watering, and protecting young plants from common pests, you’ll enjoy numerous harvests of vibrant, flavorful leaves that bring a peppery zest to both raw and cooked dishes.;Deep Green Permaculture
"Pruning is a common practice that’s used to maintain the health, shape, and productivity of trees. However, it creates wounds that can expose trees to infections and pests. To protect trees, it was once standard practice to paint fresh pruning cuts and bark damage on trees with a bitumen-based pruning sealer. This was done to prevent bacteria and fungi from entering the wound and causing decay, and to also create a barrier against infestations of pest insects such as borers. The practice has largely fallen out of favour in the arboriculture world after certain research in the s concluded that pruning sealants were not particularly helpful. The study “Wound Dressings: Results of Studies Over  Years” was published by scientists Alex L. Shigo and Walter C. Shortle from the USDA Forest Service in the Journal of Arboriculture in December . Their conclusion was as follows: “Many materials were used in and on experimentally inflicted wounds in many studies over a -year period. No material prevented decay. The individual tree had a greater effect on the wound than the treatments. Some individual trees of a species closed and compartmentalized wounds rapidly and effectively, regardless of treatment, while other trees did not close and compartmentalize treated or control wounds.” The original study can be downloaded here – “Wound Dressings: Results of Studies Over  Years” by Alex L. Shigo and Walter C. Shortle, USDA Forest Service. Prior research, as early as the s, had also found that tree wound dressings did not prevent decay, and were of limited benefit for wound closure, so the matter had been raised half a century before these results were published. Regardless, pruning sealants still are in use today, and there are many more modern formulations available with promises of improved performance. In this article, we will look at how trees naturally repair damage they sustain, what effects pruning sealers have on tree healing processes, whether any pruning sealants are worth using, and what preventative measures we can use when pruning to help trees heal faster and more effectively. One of the reasons gardeners think it’s necessary to cover tree wounds created by pruning cuts is because that’s what we naturally do for ourselves when we cut or scrape our skin. Covering our own wounds reduces bleeding, keeps wounds clean while keeping harmful pathogens out, and generally helps promote healing. The only problem with this reasoning is that trees are not animals like us, they are plants, and they therefore function and repair themselves very differently from the way that we do. In biology, humans and trees belong to different kingdoms and therefore occupy different branches of the taxonomic classification system. In biology, when organisms belong to the same taxonomical categories, they are more closely related, and therefore share more similarities. When they’re from completely different taxonomic kingdoms, they naturally tend to differ vastly in appearance and function. The way we humans repair bodily damage is that we heal our wounds, while trees seal their wounds. Our skin is capable of repairing itself, and after wounds have healed, the skin usually regenerates, restoring the wound site back to the way it was originally, with damage no longer visible. Trees in their natural environment are vulnerable to injury through physical damage from fire, frost, winds, and falling trees. They may also be attacked by animals, insects, fungi, and bacteria. In areas of human habitation, they can be accidentally damaged by lawn equipment such as brush cutters, line trimmers and mowers, as well as by vehicles. Also, when trees are pruned to establish and maintain their form and shape, injury is also incurred as the pruning cuts create wound sites. When trees are damaged, the wounded tissue releases certain phytochemicals (plant chemicals) such as terpenes, phenolics, aldehydes and phytohormones, many of which play a protective role, but their presence may also attract the attention of pests and diseases that are drawn to the exposed, unprotected tissue beneath the bark. Many pests and diseases intentionally seek out trees in distress, as the wounded and newly exposed plant tissue offers a convenient entry point for them. Unhealthy trees also have weakened natural defenses and are less capable of protecting themselves, making them even more attractive targets. Since trees have existed on the planet for around  million years, they have evolved natural defense mechanisms to manage such problems in order to ensure their continued survival. However, some people feel the need to “manage” the natural processes that plants have developed over eons. In the next section, we will explore the intricate processes that trees have evolved to repair their injuries. Trees do not heal injuries in the same way animals do. Instead, they rely on a defensive process called compartmentalization, in which damaged or diseased tissues are sealed off from healthy wood. This involves the formation of suberized, lignified tissues that physically and chemically deter pathogens. Around the edge of the wound, callus (or “woundwood”) develops and gradually grows inward. Because bark does not regenerate the same way skin does in animals, any resulting scars remain within the tree for its lifetime. This strategy prevents decay or pathogenic organisms—such as bacteria, fungi, and other microbes—from spreading unchecked throughout the trunk or branches. By building a chemical and structural barrier around the injury, compartmentalization allows the tree to continue growing around or even over the damaged area. In practice, this is sometimes referred to as “wound closure,” but it is distinct from true healing because the compromised wood remains contained rather than restored to its original condition. When a tree is wounded—by pruning cuts, fire damage, storm breakage, or pest/disease invasion—it cannot replace the exact lost tissue. Instead, it surrounds that damaged section with new, healthy wood. The end result is a lifetime sequestration (compartmentalization) of any decay or pathogens within the injured zone, rather than their elimination. Over time, the injured tissue becomes an isolated compartment, visible later on if the trunk or branch is cut open. How this process unfolds can be understood through four key steps (as described in the CODIT model). In essence, the tree forms chemical and physical barriers both within existing wood and at the perimeter of the wound, creating a stable compartment that slows or prevents the spread of further damage. In Dr. Alex Shigo’s CODIT model, the tree sets up “walls” internally to reduce the movement of pathogens along the sap stream: These “reaction zones” are not perfect barriers. Their role is to “compartmentalize” rather than eliminate the decay, keeping it confined as much as possible within one section of the wood. After the tree has set up the internal reaction zones, it begins producing new tissues on the outside of the wounded area: Because the old, injured wood cannot “heal” in the same way an animal might heal a wound, the damaged tissue remains inside the tree forever, locked behind these compartmentalizing walls. If the trunk or branch is cut open years later, one might see: In summary, compartmentalization is how trees “manage” injuries. Instead of healing them in the animal sense, trees create internal and external barriers to contain decay or infection, then form new layers of wood and bark around the wound. This process allows the tree to safely coexist with an internal column of damaged tissue, often for its entire lifespan. As long as the walls remain intact and the tree’s health is generally good, the overall structure and longevity of the tree remain largely unaffected by the old wound. Another reason gardeners think pruning cuts need to be painted with pruning sealer is to help prevent the tree from losing too much sap, and literally ‘bleeding to death’. This is an understandable concern, but trees don’t actually ‘bleed’ as they don’t have blood, they have sap, which performs a very different function. The blood in animals is critical to their survival because it carries oxygen to all the cells within the body to keep them alive. By contrast, plant sap carries water, minerals and sugars, which serve as food, or an energy source, but doesn’t carry oxygen. Therefore, trees can lose a fair bit of sap, and still survive without major injury. Sap loss can weaken a tree because it’s losing stored energy, but the dripping sap does run back into the soil where the tree’s roots are, so it might be able to reclaim some of the water and nutrients from the ground. To prevent excessive sap loss, avoid pruning deciduous trees and vines too late in the winter dormant season, when the weather warms and the sap begins to rise. Grape vines and mulberry trees in particular can bleed copious amounts of sap if pruned at the time when buds are beginning to swell. Regardless, pruning sealers aren’t effective at all in reducing the dripping of sap from a pruning cut, as the pressure of the sap flow just forces its way through the layer of sealer before it hardens or sets. I’ve tried it, and can confirm it doesn’t work! The sap flow will just stop naturally of its own accord when the tree compartmentalises the wound, and as part of that process, seals off the vascular tissue (tubes in its tissues that carry the liquid) around the wound site. Trees do not heal wounds in the same way animals do. Instead, they compartmentalize damage—forming barriers within the wood and producing callus (woundwood) around pruning cuts to contain decay and pathogens. When you apply pruning sealer to a fresh cut, the artificial coating can: Research and practical experience have led many arborists and horticulturists to conclude that pruning sealers generally do more harm than good. Key reasons include: Although rarely recommended, there are scenarios where a pruning sealer (often a latex-based product) may be used: While research supporting this advice is questionable at best, it may be justifiable to use a fungicide or insecticide during spring or summer pruning. Ideally, avoid pruning susceptible trees during active disease periods (usually spring/summer) whenever possible. Dormant-season pruning (late fall or winter) reduces both insect activity and disease pressure, lessening any need for sealers. Instead of relying on pruning sealers, proper tree care and maintenance are generally more effective for promoting healthy wound closure: By following these steps—pruning properly, choosing the right timing, and supporting overall tree health—you can help your trees recover naturally without the drawbacks associated with most commercial pruning sealers. There are various ways we minimise pruning damage to trees, allowing them to heal faster or more easily, as detailed below: Retain the Branch Collar: Flush cuts that are level with the surface of the trunk leave a larger wound opening, and damage trunk tissue, leaving the tree vulnerable and susceptible to pests, diseases, and decay. A proper pruning cut is a clean cut made at a -degree angle, outside of the branch collar. Prune Earlier Rather Than Later: When we need to reshape a tree, we should make those formative pruning cuts earlier in the tree’s life. If we cut off an unwanted side branch on a young tree when the branch is thin, it will leave a very small pruning wound that’s only as wide as the branch itself. That pruning wound may only be cm (/″) for example, which will heal fairly fast and seal over quite easily. Pruning wounds don’t grow in size as the tree grows, they stay the same size. On the other hand, if we wait many years, and cut off the same branch when it’s cm thick, this will leave a cm wound, which is much larger, causes more tissue damage to the tree, and is harder for the tree to seal off. With some simple mathematics, the area of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = π x r, where π=/ or . and r is the radius, or half the diameter of the circle. Shape trees by training (pruning them to the desired form) them when they are young. Cutting small branches when the tree is young avoids the need to cut larger branches later. The large wounds produced by removing large branches create greater injuries to the tree that are more difficult to repair. The time it takes for a tree to close a wound can vary dramatically among species and depends on environmental conditions, genetic capacity, and the overall health and vigor of the tree. In some cases, a tree may never fully seal a wound due to genetic limitations or lack of resources. Nonetheless, research consistently shows that quicker wound closure reduces the likelihood of long-term health problems, making rapid healing beneficial. Healthy, vigorously growing trees—especially younger ones—typically seal wounds more quickly. Good soil conditions (including adequate drainage, favorable soil texture and structure, and sufficient nutrients) also help support faster wound closure. Therefore, when planting new trees, it’s important to consider site selection and soil quality, as these factors can greatly influence a tree’s growth and its ability to recover from wounds. Decades of arboricultural research—most notably by Dr. Alex Shigo—demonstrate that pruning sealers are generally unnecessary and can even harm a tree’s natural healing processes. While marketed as a way to prevent sap loss, disease, and insect infestations, sealers often trap moisture and decay organisms, interfere with callus formation, and fail to keep pests out. Trees rely on compartmentalization to isolate damaged tissue and grow new wood around the wound; sealers do little to improve or speed up that process. The sole exception is when pruning highly susceptible species (like oaks prone to oak wilt) during active disease-transmission periods. In such cases, a thin coat of latex-based paint—or a fungicide or insecticide—may offer partial protection. Even then, dormant-season pruning is strongly recommended to minimize disease and insect activity from the outset. Ultimately, the best defense against infections and pests lies in proper pruning practices: In short, let trees do the work they’ve evolved to do. Healthy trees, pruned correctly, can generally compartmentalize wounds effectively—without the added complications of synthetic sealants.";Deep Green Permaculture
"The Parlour Palm, also known as Chamaedorea elegans, is a classic and elegant houseplant that has graced indoor spaces for generations. With its arching fronds and gentle, feathery appearance, this palm adds a touch of tropical charm to any home. This guide covers everything you need to know about caring for the Parlour Palm, to ensure it thrives and flourishes. Scientific Name: Chamaedorea elegans Common Names: Parlour Palm, Neanthe Bella Palm Origin: Native to the rainforests of Southern Mexico and Guatemala Description: The Parlour Palm is a compact, slow-growing palm characterized by its slender, cane-like stems and delicate, pinnate fronds. Each frond bears numerous leaflets, giving the plant a lush, feathery appearance. Typically reaching heights of  to  cm ( to  feet) indoors, this palm is perfect for small spaces, tabletops, or as an accent in any room. In ideal conditions, it may produce small, inconspicuous yellow flowers at the base of the fronds. Benefits: Apart from its graceful form, the Parlour Palm is known for being relatively low-maintenance and highly adaptable to indoor conditions. It also helps improve air quality by filtering out common indoor pollutants. With its ability to thrive in moderate to low light environments, this palm is an excellent choice for both beginner and experienced plant enthusiasts. Watering Needs: Parlour Palms prefer evenly moist soil but can tolerate slight drying between waterings. Water thoroughly, allowing excess water to drain, then wait until the top inch of soil feels dry before watering again. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so be mindful of soil moisture levels. During the cooler months, reduce the frequency of watering as the plant’s growth slows. Soil and Potting: A well-draining potting mix is ideal for Parlour Palms. Use a premium quality general purpose potting mix. You can also amended the mix with perlite to further improve drainage though this is usually never necessary. Ensure the pot has drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating at the bottom. Repotting is only necessary every - years or when the plant becomes root-bound. Light Requirements: Parlour Palms adapt well to a range of lighting conditions, from low to bright, indirect light. Using a lux meter to measure light intensity can help determine the best placement for your Parlour Palm, ensuring it receives the appropriate amount of light without direct sun exposure. Temperature and Humidity: Parlour Palms thrive in temperatures between °C to °C (°F and °F). They are sensitive to cold drafts and should be kept away from temperatures below °C (°F). These palms enjoy average household humidity levels but appreciate additional moisture in very dry environments. If the air is particularly dry, consider misting the fronds or placing the pot on a pebble tray filled with water. Fertilization and Pruning: Feed your Parlour Palm with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half strength once a month during the growing season (spring and summer), or use a solid slow-release solid fertilizer that comes in pellets or prills (little round balls) in spring. Reduce feeding in the autumn and winter when the plant’s growth slows. Pruning is minimal; simply remove any yellow or brown fronds at the base to maintain a tidy appearance and encourage healthier growth. Parlour Palms are relatively pest-resistant but can occasionally be affected by spider mites, mealybugs, and scale. Regularly inspect your plant and treat any infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Common issues include browning fronds, which can indicate low humidity or underwatering, and yellowing fronds, often a sign of overwatering or inadequate drainage. Ensuring consistent moisture levels and providing proper light can help prevent these problems. Parlour Palms are typically propagated from seed or by dividing clumps, although the process can be slow and challenging. Here’s how: Step : Prepare Your Tools and Materials Step : Identify Where to Divide the Plant – Parlour Palms do not produce traditional stem cuttings. Propagation is usually done by carefully separating clumps from the base or starting from seed. If dividing, identify a clump with its own roots and gently separate it from the main plant. Step : Prepare the Division – If removing a clump, ensure that each section has a healthy root system and a few fronds. Trim away any damaged roots or dead fronds. Step : Plant the Division – Fill a small pot with fresh, well-draining potting mix. Place the separated clump or seedling into the soil, ensuring the roots are well-covered. Press the soil gently around the base to provide support. Step : Water and Care for the Division – Water the newly potted division or seedling lightly and place it in a location with bright, indirect light. Keep the soil slightly moist but not waterlogged.

Dill is an annual herb grown for its aromatic, feathery green leaves, known for their distinct flavor, and for its seeds, which are commonly used as a spice. The plant has slender, upright, branched hollow stems with delicate, finely divided compound leaves that are blue-green in color, and can grow – cm (.– ft) in height. Dill plants typically flower in mid-to-late summer, producing small fragrant yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels that attract beneficial insects. The flowers after - weeks produce tiny, oval seeds (around – mm long) that are flattened and ridged. While dill typically completes its life cycle in one season—germinating, flowering, and setting seed—volunteer plants can appear if seeds drop naturally and sprout the following year. Both leaves (dill weed) and seeds are widely used for culinary and medicinal purposes. In many cuisines, dill is prized for its ability to enhance pickling brines and lighten the flavor of rich dishes. Eastern European soups and stews often feature dill, while Scandinavian cultures use it to season fish and potatoes. Across continents, dill weed and seeds lend a fresh, tangy twist to foods. Dill is a warm-weather annual herb that grows best in temperatures ranging from –°C (–°F), with an optimal range around –°C (–°F). It can grow in a range of soils but thrives well-drained, moderately fertile, slightly acidic soil (pH .-.), rich in organic matter. Dill grows best in full sun and should be planted in an area that receives  to  hours of direct sunlight every day, in a location sheltered from strong winds which can easily damage the hollow stems of the plant. It requires consistently warm soil and ample sunlight to produce lush foliage and abundant flower heads. Regular watering is important, however take care to avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and diminished vigor. Dill seeds are typically sown directly into the ground because the plant’s long delicate taproot is easily damaged when disturbed during transplanting. This root damage can lead to transplant shock or stunted growth, making direct sowing the preferred method. Sow seeds outdoors into the garden in early spring after all danger of frosts has passed. Seedlings will emerge after - days, depending on soil temperature. For a continuous supply of fresh dill, you can sow seeds in succession at intervals ranging anywhere from every two weeks to every six weeks. Sow seeds every - weeks in cooler climates or where the season is relatively short, for more frequent but smaller harvests. In regions with longer growing seasons, spacing sowings every - weeks allows each planting enough time to mature before the next round goes in. Ultimately, the best approach depends on your local conditions and personal preference for how often you want fresh dill. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location >Dill is a hardy plant and can tolerate temperatures down to -.°C (°F) once established, Dill plants require little water, usually irrigating once or twice a week is sufficient and one light application of fertilizer late in the Spring should be enough to sustain the plant for the entire growing season. If the plant is not sufficiently sheltered from wind, the plants will benefit from staking to prevent the hollow stems from snapping.  Harvesting Time: Harvesting Tips: Dill is cherished worldwide for its bright, tangy flavor and herbal aroma, and it’s a popular herb in many cuisines for seasoning soups, salads, pickles, fish dishes, and more. The leaves and seeds of dill have distinct culinary profiles. Dill leaves (commonly called dill weed) provide a light, grassy flavor ideal for garnishing, whereas dill seeds possess a sharper, more robust taste similar to caraway. This versatility allows dill to be used in both delicate sauces and pungent spice blends. In Scandinavian and Eastern European cooking, dill frequently pairs with fish, potatoes, and yogurt-based dressings, lending a fresh twist that complements rather than overwhelms other ingredients. Notably, dill is integral in cucumber pickles, contributing that signature dill-infused bite. The seeds, which taste slightly bitter and stronger than the leaves, are often used whole or crushed in baking, spice mixes, and pickling brines. Middle Eastern and Mediterranean recipes may incorporate dill into rice dishes, creamy dips like tzatziki, and fresh salads. In Indian cuisine, fresh dill is occasionally sautéed with lentils or added to vegetable dishes for an aromatic boost. For best results, dill weed is commonly added at the end of cooking to preserve its delicate taste and bright aroma. Beyond savory applications, dill can also be worked into bread dough or stirred into compound butter for a subtle herbal note. Steeping dill leaves in hot water makes a light herbal tea. However it’s used, dill adds an unmistakable brightness to dishes, reflecting its legacy as a long-time culinary staple in various regional cuisines around the globe. In conclusion, growing dill is rewarding for both its culinary uses and its ability to attract beneficial insects. This easy-to-grow herb can be sown multiple times throughout the growing season to ensure a continuous supply. With its minimal care requirements and quick growth, dill is an excellent addition to any herb garden.;Deep Green Permaculture

The burning of Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA)–treated timber and synthetic wood products bonded with urea-formaldehyde (UF) or phenol-formaldehyde (PF) glues poses serious hazards to human health and the environment. Combustion releases carcinogenic (cancer-causing) and toxic chemicals—such as arsenic trioxide, hexavalent chromium, formaldehyde, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)—that contaminate air, soil, and water. This article explains the science behind these dangers, examines the health and environmental risks of burning them, and outlines safer disposal options. Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA)-treated timber is a type of pressure-treated wood designed for durability and resistance to biological decay. Introduced in the s, CCA treatment involves impregnating wood with a preservative solution containing chromium, copper, and arsenic, which binds to the wood fibers, providing long-term protection against rot, fungi, and insect damage. Due to its ability to withstand outdoor conditions, CCA-treated timber has been widely used in applications such as utility poles, fence posts, decking, landscaping timbers, and agricultural structures. However, concerns about arsenic leaching into soil and water, as well as health risks associated with handling and disposal, have led to restrictions or bans on its use in residential settings in many countries since the early s. Despite these regulations, CCA-treated timber remains prevalent in industrial and commercial applications, where its longevity and resistance to environmental degradation are highly valued. CCA is composed of three main chemical components: chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), and arsenic (As), each serving a specific purpose in the preservation of the wood: While CCA treatment enhances wood longevity, these same chemicals make improper disposal hazardous. When burned, CCA-treated timber releases toxic byproducts, including arsenic trioxide and hexavalent chromium, which pose severe health and environmental risks. The combustion of CCA-treated timber produces several toxic byproducts, primarily these involve the transformation of chromium, arsenic, and copper into more hazardous forms. Chromium in CCA-treated wood is usually in the trivalent state (Cr(III)). However, during combustion, some Cr(III) can be oxidized to turn into hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), a highly toxic compound. This oxidation is facilitated by the high temperatures and the presence of oxygen during burning. Conversely, Cr(VI) present in the wood can also undergo reduction to turn back back to the less toxic form Cr(III), depending on the combustion conditions. Although hexavalent chromium is not considered highly volatile, the high temperatures during combustion can cause it to bind to fine particulate matter and become airborne, increasing inhalation risks. During the burning of CCA-treated wood, arsenic compounds present in the wood are oxidized to form arsenic trioxide (As₂O₃), a highly toxic and volatile compound. The high temperatures facilitate the volatilization of arsenic, allowing it to become airborne as fine particles or gases. Copper in CCA-treated timber is primarily present as Cu(II) (Cu+) compounds. During combustion, copper is oxidized to form copper oxides, such as cupric oxide (CuO) and cuprous oxide (Cu₂O). These compounds are less volatile than arsenic and chromium compounds but still pose environmental risks when released into the atmosphere or left behind in ash residues. In this section we will look at how the toxic byproducts produced by burning Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA)-treated timber pose health risks through inhalation and by entering the food chain. Hexavalent chromium is classified as carcinogenic to humans by multiple agencies, including the IARC, due to its strong association with lung cancer. Inhalation of airborne Cr(VI) particles poses a significant health risk, as these fine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs, leading to chronic health conditions and increased cancer risk. Inhalation of Cr(VI)-laden dust or fumes can also damage mucous membranes, cause respiratory irritation, and lead to chronic health conditions. Even short-term exposures may result in skin burns upon contact with airborne particles, whereas prolonged or repeated exposure amplifies the risk of both respiratory and systemic toxicity. Trivalent chromium, while less toxic, can still cause adverse health effects, including allergic reactions and irritation. Arsenic in CCA-treated wood exists primarily in forms that remain bound to the wood matrix. However, during combustion, it can transform into arsenic trioxide (As₂O₃), which is extremely toxic and is also classified as a Group  carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Inhalation of As₂O₃ can lead to acute symptoms such as respiratory distress, coughing, and irritation of the mucous membranes. Long-term exposure increases the risk of developing lung cancer, skin lesions, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological damage. Arsenic trioxide’s volatility means it can easily disperse into the environment, contaminating air, soil, and water sources once released. While copper is an essential trace element for many organisms, it becomes toxic at higher concentrations. When CCA-treated timber burns, copper is released primarily as copper oxides. Inhalation of copper fumes or oxides can lead to metal fume fever, , a condition characterized by flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, respiratory irritation, and fatigue. Repeated or prolonged exposure to copper compounds can cause liver and kidney damage, as well as neurological effects. Copper oxides from the ash can also persist in the environment, contributing to soil and water contamination. While inhalation is the primary concern, toxic compounds from burned CCA-treated timber can settle onto land or water bodies, eventually entering the food chain. Direct skin contact with ash containing Cr(VI), As₂O₃, or copper oxides can result in skin irritation or chemical burns. Furthermore, accidental ingestion of contaminated soil or residue—particularly a risk for children and animals—can lead to a broad range of gastrointestinal and systemic illnesses. Burning CCA-treated timber has significant and long-lasting environmental impacts. The ash left behind after combustion contains concentrated amounts of chromium, copper, and arsenic, which are highly toxic to plants, animals, and microorganisms. These metals can leach into the soil, contaminating it and reducing its fertility. Arsenic, being highly soluble, can easily migrate and leach through soil layers, leading to groundwater contamination. This not only affects the quality of drinking water but also poses a threat to aquatic life and ecosystems. The airborne release of toxic metals during combustion also contributes to air pollution. These pollutants can travel significant distances, depositing in soil and water bodies far from the original burn site, leading to widespread environmental contamination. The persistence of these toxic metals in the environment means that the impacts of burning CCA-treated timber can last for decades, making it crucial to avoid this practice and seek safer disposal methods. In addition to CCA-treated wood, synthetic timber products also pose significant risks when burned. This section explores the types of synthetic adhesives commonly used in these products and their associated hazards. Synthetic timber products, such as plywood, particleboard, medium-density fiberboard (MDF), and other engineered wood materials, are widely used in building construction, furniture making, and various other applications. These products are manufactured by bonding wood fibers, particles, or veneers together using synthetic resins. Among the most commonly used adhesives in these products are urea-formaldehyde (UF) and phenol-formaldehyde (PF) glues. Urea-Formaldehyde (UF) Glue: Phenol-Formaldehyde (PF) Glue: Synthetic timber products bonded with UF and PF glues are ubiquitous in both residential and commercial construction, as well as in furniture manufacturing. Their versatility, affordability, and adaptability to various uses have made them indispensable in modern building practices. Below are some of the common applications for these materials: Plywood is made by bonding thin layers (veneers) of wood together, with the grain of each layer running perpendicular (crossways at  degrees) to the one below it. This cross-grain construction provides strength and stability, making plywood a favored material in construction, flooring, cabinetry, and furniture. UF glues are often used in interior-grade plywood, while PF glues are used in exterior-grade plywood due to their moisture resistance. Urea-formaldehyde glues are widely used in engineered wood products, but when these materials are burned, they release dangerous chemicals. This section examines the combustion process and the toxic byproducts that emerge. Urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins are thermosetting polymers widely used as adhesives in the production of engineered wood products, such as particleboard, plywood, and medium-density fiberboard (MDF), as mentioned above. When UF glues are exposed to high temperatures during combustion, they undergo thermal decomposition, breaking down into a variety of toxic chemical byproducts. The combustion process is complex and involves several stages, including pyrolysis, oxidation, and volatilization of the breakdown products. During the initial stages of combustion, the heat causes the urea-formaldehyde polymer to decompose, releasing formaldehyde gas as one of the primary volatile organic compounds (VOCs). As the temperature increases, the urea component also decomposes, producing ammonia (NH₃), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and carbon monoxide (CO). Additionally, under certain conditions, the decomposition of nitrogen-containing compounds in the UF resin can lead to the formation of highly toxic gases like hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and various nitrogen oxides (NOx). The combustion of UF resins produces several hazardous byproducts that pose significant risks to both human health and the environment. These byproducts include formaldehyde, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and other volatile organic compounds. In combination, the inhalation of the toxic byproducts produced from the combustion of urea-formaldehyde glues presents significant health risks. Acute exposure to formaldehyde, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide can cause severe respiratory distress, irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and in the case of hydrogen cyanide, potentially fatal poisoning. The fine particles and gases released during combustion can penetrate deep into the lungs, leading to long-term health issues, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and an increased risk of cancer. The inhalation of carbon monoxide is particularly dangerous because it can occur without immediate symptoms, leading to unconsciousness or death before a person realizes they are being poisoned. The cumulative effects of exposure to these toxic byproducts underscore the severe dangers associated with burning UF-bonded synthetic timber products. The environmental impacts of burning urea-formaldehyde resins are significant. The release of VOCs and NOx contributes to air pollution and the formation of smog, which can have widespread effects on public health and the environment. The chemicals released during combustion can also settle on soil and water bodies, leading to contamination and harming plant and aquatic life. Formaldehyde and other VOCs are particularly persistent in the environment, where they can contribute to the degradation of air quality over large areas. The environmental consequences of burning UF-containing materials emphasize the importance of proper disposal methods and avoiding combustion whenever possible. Phenol-formaldehyde glues are another common adhesive used in synthetic timber products, particularly those intended for outdoor use. This section examines the combustion process and the toxic byproducts that emerge. Phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins are a type of thermosetting polymer commonly used in the production of exterior-grade plywood, laminated beams, and other structural wood products that require high durability and resistance to moisture. PF resins are synthesized through a chemical reaction between phenol (C₆H₅OH) and formaldehyde (CH₂O), resulting in a cross-linked polymer that provides strong adhesive properties and long-lasting performance. However, when subjected to high temperatures, such as during combustion, PF resins undergo thermal degradation, producing a variety of toxic byproducts. The combustion of PF glues involves several stages, including pyrolysis, oxidation, and volatilization of the breakdown products. During pyrolysis, the heat causes the polymer chains of the PF resin to break down, releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases, and particulates. As the temperature increases, these compounds undergo further oxidation, forming hazardous substances that can volatilize and become airborne, posing significant risks to human health and the environment. The combustion of phenol-formaldehyde resins produces several toxic byproducts, including phenol, formaldehyde, benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and carbon monoxide. Each of these compounds poses distinct health and environmental risks. The inhalation of the toxic byproducts produced from the combustion of phenol-formaldehyde glues presents significant health risks. Phenol, formaldehyde, benzene, and PAHs are all potent carcinogens, and their presence in smoke can lead to acute and chronic health problems. Immediate exposure can result in respiratory distress, irritation of the mucous membranes, and systemic toxicity. Long-term exposure to these chemicals increases the risk of developing cancers, particularly of the lungs, skin, and blood. Carbon monoxide, though less persistent in the environment, poses an immediate and severe risk to human health due to its ability to cause poisoning with little warning. The cumulative effects of exposure to these toxic byproducts underscore the severe dangers associated with burning PF-bonded synthetic timber products. The environmental impacts of burning phenol-formaldehyde resins are significant. The release of VOCs, benzene, and PAHs contributes to air pollution, which can have widespread effects on public health and the environment. PAHs, in particular, are persistent pollutants that can contaminate soil and water, leading to long-term ecological damage. These compounds can bioaccumulate in the food chain, posing risks to wildlife and humans who consume contaminated food. Benzene and other VOCs can also contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone and photochemical smog, both of which are harmful to human health and can lead to respiratory problems, reduced lung function, and other health issues. The environmental consequences of burning PF-containing materials emphasize the importance of proper disposal methods and avoiding combustion whenever possible. Given the serious health and environmental risks associated with burning CCA-treated and synthetic timber, understanding safe disposal methods is crucial. This section outlines recommended practices for managing these hazardous materials. CCA-Treated Timber: Synthetic Timber Products (with UF and PF Glues): Long-term strategies include replacing hazardous materials with less toxic alternatives. For instance, naturally rot-resistant wood species (like cedar or redwood) and non-toxic adhesives (such as soy-based glues or formaldehyde-free resins) offer safer options for construction and manufacturing. In summary, burning CCA-treated timber or synthetic wood products containing urea-formaldehyde (UF) and phenol-formaldehyde (PF) glues poses serious risks to both human health and the environment. The release of carcinogens—such as hexavalent chromium, arsenic trioxide, and formaldehyde—can contaminate air, soil, and water, causing acute and long-term harm. To prevent these hazards, it is critical to avoid burning these materials and instead follow proper disposal methods, such as using licensed landfills or specialized waste facilities. Whenever feasible, choosing safer alternatives—like non-toxic adhesives or naturally rot-resistant wood—further reduces the potential for toxic exposure and safeguards ecosystems over the long term.;Deep Green Permaculture

"Citrus fruits – such as oranges, lemons, limes, mandarins (tangerines), and grapefruit – do not ripen or sweeten once they’re off the tree. Unlike apples, pears or peaches, citrus must reach maturity on the tree for best flavor​. This means picking at the right time is crucial. But how can you tell when your citrus fruit is at peak ripeness? In this guide, we’ll cover all the practical indicators for determining ripeness of each type, including color, texture, firmness, scent, and weight, and explains how growing conditions and varietal differences may influence these signs. Before exploring how each particular citrus variety ripens, it helps to be familiar with the key ripening characteristics common to all citrus fruit. With these general principles in mind, let’s look at specific fruits and the signs we can use to judge their ripeness. Sweet oranges are generally harvested in the cooler months, but it depends on the variety. Early-season oranges like navels and Hamlins typically ripen in the early to mid part of autumn through winter, while late-season oranges like Valencia mature in maturity during mid to late winter and can even hang on the tree into early spring. Keep in mind local climate affects timing – in warm tropical areas, oranges may ripen a bit differently (and might not turn fully orange in color due to lack of cold nights). One useful quirk of oranges is that they can hang on the tree after they’re ripe without immediate spoilage. In fact, farmers often leave Valencia oranges on the tree for months longer to boost sweetness; they’ll even reabsorb chlorophyll and turn green again on the outside during summer, a phenomenon called “regreening,” while the inside stays sweet​. So don’t panic if your late oranges start to get a green tinge – check the taste. As long as the flavor is good, they are fine to eat despite the color. (Note: This regreening mainly happens with Valencia-type oranges in late season; winter oranges like navels usually don’t regreen.) How to Tell They’re Ripe: Harvesting: Ripe oranges should detach easily from the tree with a gentle twist or tug. If an orange resists, it’s best to allow a little more time for it to reach its optimal firmness and weight. Be careful not to pull too hard and damage the branch, if in doubt, use pruning shears to clip mature oranges. Also, watch for any fruit that has naturally fallen – healthy-looking oranges dropping to the ground are a sign many of them are ripe and ready to harvest (just check fallen fruit for splits or damage). For a tree full of oranges, you don’t have to harvest all at once. In many cases—especially with varieties like Valencia oranges, that are renowned for being able to hang on the tree for extended periods and remain in excellent condition—growers often allow these fruits to remain on the tree well past the initial signs of ripeness to further enhance sugar development and flavor, even if slight regreening occurs in warmer conditions. Instead, they can be picked gradually over several weeks when needed, as they reach their peak. Oranges can hang in “storage” mode on the tree without losing much quality​, especially in cooler weather (just beware of hard freezes – if a freeze is coming, pick any ripe fruit to avoid frost damage). Lemons typically turn from green to yellow as they ripen. Common lemon varieties (like Eureka and Lisbon) often have main crops that ripen in winter. In some climates, lemons can produce multiple crops per year – it’s not unusual to see green lemons and ripe yellow lemons on the tree at the same time. Meyer lemons, a sweeter orange-lemon hybrid, may bloom and ripen year-round but peak in the later part of autumn into winter. Generally, lemons take about  to  months to develop and ripen after flowering​. Once mature, they can hang on the tree for a while. In fact, it’s often fine to leave ripe lemons on the tree until you need them (within reason). Many citrus growers note lemons (and limes) don’t drop as quickly as some oranges do, so you have some flexibility. However, an overripe lemon might eventually fall or start to dull in flavor, so don’t leave them indefinitely. How to Tell They’re Ripe: Harvesting: Ripe lemons can be clipped or gently twisted off the tree. If a lemon does not pull off with moderate pressure, give it a bit more time. Often lemons will start to drop on their own when extremely ripe – if you find lemons falling to the ground in wind or by a light touch, they’re at peak (or maybe a tad overripe). It’s a good practice to pick any that fall, and use them if they’re in good shape. Also, because lemons can hang on the tree, you can harvest in batches. For example, you might pick the fully yellow ones now and leave any that are still showing green for a few more weeks. Limes can be tricky because we often use them in their immature (green) stage for peak tartness. The most common lime, the Tahitian lime (also known as the Persian or Bearss lime), is typically harvested when it’s green and full-sized, before it turns yellow. However, a fully ripe lime is actually yellow. Tahitian limes, if allowed to fully ripen on the tree, will turn a yellowish color and become less acidic, and juicer with a with a more mild, mellow flavor. Key limes (Mexican limes) likewise turn yellow-orange when ripe. In many regions, limes have a main crop in late summer to early winter. For instance, in some warm climates limes ripen in winter and might even drop in the cooler months. If you’re in a cold temperate zone growing limes indoors or in a greenhouse, they may follow a similar - month cycle from bloom to ripe as lemons do​. The key with limes is to decide how you like them: green limes are more tart with a stronger aroma and tang, while yellow limes are less tart and yield more juice. A fully yellow lime will be sweeter and juicier than a green one. However, if you prefer the stronger aroma and tang of a green lime, you might pick it slightly earlier. Keep in mind that green limes are not fully mature—they’re used that way as a preference for their distinctive flavor. If your goal is to ensure full ripeness, let at least some limes turn yellow on the tree; these will have the best juice content and a sweeter taste. Commercially, limes are picked while still green, but at home you have the luxury of letting them fully ripen for maximum juice and a hint of sweetness. How to Tell They’re Ripe: Harvesting: Limes are usually picked by twisting, or clipping them from the tree with pruning snips/secateurs. They may may be harder to notice when they drop, so check trees frequently once limes reach full size. In the cooler months look out for fruit that have naturally fallen from the tree—these are usually ripe and ready to use. It’s usually best to harvest limes before a freeze (they are sensitive to cold). Also, harvest all limes once they’re yellow to prevent them from going bad on the tree. For juice and flavor, decide whether you prefer the tart green stage or the sweeter, juicer, less acidic yellow stage. If you’ve only ever bought green limes from the store, try letting some of your homegrown limes turn yellow. You’ll notice they become much juicier and slightly less sour​. Many gardeners are surprised by how flavorful a truly ripe (yellow) lime can be. Of course, for that punchy tart flavor, use them green – it’s really about what stage you need them. Just remember, green or yellow, the lime won’t improve after picking, so get them at the stage you want while they’re still on the tree. Mandarins is a broad category that includes tangerines, clementines, satsumas, and other small, easy-peel citrus, which are often among the first citrus fruits to ripen in the season. They typically reach their peak during early to mid-autumn or early winter. However, many mandarins do not hold on the tree quite as long as oranges or grapefruit after ripening. Many will begin to drop or deteriorate a few weeks after peak ripeness. Satsumas, for instance, are infamous for their limited or short hang time on the tree once they ripen and reach peak quality. If not picked, they can become overripe relatively quickly (the rind gets puffy and the fruit loses flavor)​. They may quickly drop or deteriorate, so it’s best to harvest promptly when ready. How to Tell They’re Ripe: Harvesting: Mandarins usually detach quite easily with a gentle tug. If a fruit is stubborn, use clippers to avoid tearing the skin. Be gentle – their peels are thinner than oranges, so they can tear if pulled too hard. Because many mandarins have a short tree-life after ripening (some only a couple of weeks of prime time​), plan to pick them promptly once they taste good. Satsumas, for example, might only stay perfect on the tree for about – weeks after they first ripen​. After that, they’ll start to get puffy and drop. So for mandarins, a timely harvest is important. Pick all the good ones and leave any that are still partly green for a later pass. Varietal Considerations: Different types of mandarins—such as early-ripening satsumas, the slightly later maturing clementines, or even hybrid tangerines—will show subtle differences in skin texture, flavor, and the ideal time for picking. Use these characteristics alongside the general signs of ripeness to guide your harvest. Grapefruit often bloom in spring and the fruit typically ripen during the cooler parts of the year, from mid-winter into early spring. They can have a long harvest season – growers sometimes pick grapefruit over a - month period. Many varieties, such as Ruby Red, are known for achieving their best flavor after hanging on the tree for a period, allowing their initially high acidity to mellow into a more balanced sweetness. Grapefruit gradually transition from highly acidic to sweeter as they remain on the tree. They should be harvested when the sugar-to-acid ratio is optimal, as they do not sweeten after being picked. The rule is similar to other citrus: they do not ripen off the tree, so you want them fully mature (sweet enough) before picking​. However, be mindful that while a grapefruit can remain on the tree for some time, waiting too long may lead to overripeness or drying out. Also, be mindful if grapefruit are left hanging into late spring, as they may get hit by heat waves or pests. How to Tell They’re Ripe: Harvesting: Because grapefruit tend to have a thick stem attachment, it’s best to use clippers or pruners to cut them off, rather than twisting them off by hand, to avoid tearing the peel. Any tear in the peel will invite rot if the fruit is stored. They don’t always “pull” off as easily as oranges. Harvest the lowest fruits first, as those are often the earliest, and also more prone to frost damage​, and get the higher ones later. Grapefruit can hang for a while, but by late spring (or sooner in hot areas) they should be picked to make way for the new crop that will start setting. If your grapefruit taste too tart initially, leaving some on the tree (while keeping a careful watch) might allow them to develop a sweeter, more balanced flavor. However, don’t leave them so long that they become dry or damaged from heat waves or pests. Usually, by the time the tree begins its spring bloom, the previous season’s grapefruit should be harvested. In summary, a ripe citrus fruit will generally be fully (or mostly) colored, feel heavy and firm, give off a rich aroma, and – most importantly – taste right. If in doubt, do what growers do: sample one! With a little experience, you’ll get to know the look and feel of perfectly ripe oranges, lemons, limes, mandarins, and grapefruit from your own trees. There’s nothing quite like harvesting citrus at its peak – the reward is fruits bursting with juice and flavor. Happy harvesting!";Deep Green Permaculture
Celeriac, also known as celery root, turnip-rooted celery, knob celery or German celery, is a cool-season biennial grown primarily for its crisp, celery-flavored, bulbous root. This knobby, globe-shaped root develops partially above the soil line and is actually a swollen stem base. Though celeriac is a biennial, it is usually cultivated as an annual and harvested after its first year, when the root reaches a good size. The plant typically grows to about – cm (– in) and produces upright, green stems with leaves resembling parsley. If allowed to mature through its second year and successfully overwinter, celeriac will sproduce small white umbels (the characteristic flower clusters of Apiaceae plants like carrots and parsley), eventually forming seed pods. However, it is not typically grown for these seeds. The spice known as celery seed generally comes from smallage—a wild variety of Apium graveolens—the same wild ancestor that gave rise to modern cultivated celery with its thicker, milder stalks and celeriac with its enlarged, edible root.. Celeriac is closely related to celery but is often considered easier to grow in cool, moist conditions. Its dense, fine-grained white flesh has a smooth, celery-like flavor and stores well. Celeriac can be eaten raw—grated or sliced into salads—or cooked in soups, stews, and other mixed vegetable dishes. It is particularly popular in European cuisine, where its versatility and distinctive flavor make it a staple in many recipes. Celeriac is a cool-season crop that performs best in temperatures ranging from about –°C (–°F). It needs a relatively long growing season and tolerates light frost, and is more frost-tolerant than celery, though prolonged exposure to temperatures below °C (°F) can slow its development. In many regions, starting seeds indoors and transplanting outdoors after the risk of hard frost has passed is common. Grow celeriac in much the same way as celery. Start seeds indoors about  to  weeks before your last expected frost. Plant several seeds per hole. Seeds need light to germinate, so don’t cover them deeply. About % germination is considered normal for celeriac. Keep the soil moist and warm at roughly °C to °C (°F to °F) until seeds sprout in  to  weeks. Thin to one plant per hole once the seedlings are established. When plants are -cm ( to  / in) tall, transplant into the garden. Harden off seedlings first by gradually introducing them to cooler outdoor conditions—around °C to °C (°F to °F)—and brighter sunlight before transplanting. Celeriac thrives in full sunlight, though partial shade is acceptable if daytime temperatures are consistently cool. It prefers moist, fertile soil with good organic matter content to encourage uniform root development, and consistent watering is essential throughout the season to prevent woody or hollow centers. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Celeriac, with its mildly sweet and nutty flavor, is a versatile root vegetable that can be enjoyed both raw and cooked. Its cream-colored interior lends itself to a variety of preparations, from crisp salads to rich, comforting soups. Below are some practical tips on how to prepare and serve celeriac in everyday meals. Peeling and Preparing: Celeriac has a thick, knobby skin that should be removed before use. Cut off the top and bottom, then use a sharp knife or sturdy peeler to remove the rough exterior. Aim to remove just enough to reveal the smooth, cream-colored flesh underneath. Like many root vegetables, celeriac can oxidize and turn brown if left exposed to air for too long. If you’re preparing it in advance—or working slowly—immerse peeled pieces in a bowl of cold water with a splash of lemon juice or vinegar. Raw Uses Cooking Methods Serving Suggestions Celeriac is relatively low in calories, its natural sweetness and moderate starch make it a healthy alternative to more carbohydrate-dense tubers. Celeriac stores well and remains fresh in a cool, humid environment, making it an excellent ingredient to have on hand. With its subtle sweetness and earthy undertones, celeriac offers a refreshing change from more common root vegetables, whether it’s used in a hearty stew or a light salad. In conclusion, growing celeriac can be a rewarding crop for gardeners seeking an unusual, flavorful root crop. With proper care, consistent moisture, and a long, cool growing season, celeriac will reward you with distinctively aromatic and nutritious bulbs that can elevate a range of culinary dishes.;Deep Green Permaculture

"Soil along busy roadsides and near industrial sites often is polluted by heavy metals and persistent hydrocarbons that have accumulated there over decades, posing environmental and health risks. This article explores the sources of these contaminants, their behavior in soils, and the dangers they pose to ecosystems and human health. It also discusses precautions – especially for urban gardeners – to reduce exposure and grow food safely in affected areas. Industrial Activities and Transportation Emissions: Industrial operations (such as mining, metal smelting, and manufacturing) and vehicular traffic are primary sources of soil contamination. Smokestack emissions and particulate fallout from factories deposit toxic metals onto surrounding land, while cars and trucks emit pollutants that settle into roadside soils. For much of the th century, automotive exhaust was a major contributor to lead contamination due to the use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline. Lead was added to fuel in the s as an anti-knock agent, and for decades leaded fuel was burned worldwide. Lead particles drifted and settled on nearby soil, creating long-lasting contamination along highways and urban areas. Although leaded petrol was phased out (banned in the U.S. in  and eliminated globally by ), the toxic lead it left in topsoil remains a pressing issue. Brownfields – The Remnants of Past Pollution: The term brownfield refers to abandoned or underused properties where redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived contamination. These sites, often former factories, gas stations, or dry cleaners, may have soil and groundwater polluted with hazardous substances from prior use. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a brownfield is any property where reuse is hindered by the presence or potential presence of hazardous pollutants. There are hundreds of thousands of brownfields in the United States alone. Cleaning up and revitalizing these lands is important not only to remove environmental health hazards but also to return the land to productive use. Brownfields are less severely contaminated than “Superfund” sites (which contain more acute toxic waste) but still pose significant long-term risks if not addressed. Other Sources of Contaminants: Other historical practices have added to soil pollution. The use of lead- and arsenic-based pesticides (for example, lead arsenate in old orchards) left residues in agricultural soils. Pressure-treated lumber preserved with chromated copper arsenate (CCA) can leach arsenic into adjacent soil over time. Creosote (used on railroad ties and telephone poles) is a source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Leaks or spills of petroleum products (oil, diesel, gasoline) at industrial facilities or gas stations can introduce a range of hydrocarbons into the subsurface. Over time, these contaminants persist unless actively remediated, contributing to the patchwork of polluted soils in many urban and industrial areas. Heavy metals are dense metallic elements that are toxic even at low concentrations. Once deposited in soil, they do not biodegrade; instead, they remain indefinitely, cycling between soil, water, and living organisms. Among these pollutants, lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic are most concerning in roadside and industrial soils. The EPA classifies them as priority contaminants due to their toxicity and prevalence. Each metal has unique sources, behavior in soil, and health effects: Lead is the most common heavy metal contaminant found in soils​. It can originate from many sources: leaded gasoline (petrol) exhaust, peeling lead-based paint from old buildings, emissions from smelters, and past use of lead in products such as pesticides and plumbing. Chemically, lead is an element, so it cannot break down any further into anything else, and does not break down over time. Once lead particles settle into soil, they tend to bind to soil particles and remain near the surface, especially in the top few inches of soil​. How far lead spreads in soil depends on soil type and environmental conditions, but generally it doesn’t leach deeply unless the soil is very acidic or certain chelating (binding) agents are present.

How far lead spreads in soil depends on soil type and environmental conditions, but generally it doesn’t leach deeply unless the soil is very acidic or certain chelating (binding) agents are present. Most plants do not readily absorb large amounts of lead into edible tissues, but the degree of uptake varies by crop part. Lead tends to bind strongly in the root zone, resulting in much higher concentrations in roots than in shoots or fruits​. In fact, studies show root vegetables like carrots can accumulate significantly more lead than other crops when grown in contaminated soil​. Leafy greens (e.g. lettuce, spinach) generally take up some lead into their leaves, though typically less than root vegetable. By contrast, fruiting crops (tomatoes, peppers, beans, etc.) usually have the lowest lead levels in their edible fruit, even when grown in the same contaminated soil​. This is because lead is largely retained in roots and only a limited amount translocates (moves) to above-ground parts​. However, “limited” translocation does not mean no translocation – even small lead amounts in leaves or fruits can contribute to human exposure, especially with frequent consumption​. Moreover, any edible root that has accumulated lead (e.g. a carrot or beet) poses a direct ingestion risk if grown in lead-rich soil. Even if internal uptake by plants is limited, lead in soil can still enter the human food chain through external contamination. In other words, a greater risk of lead exposure comes from eating unwashed vegetables (with soil on them), inhalation of wind-blown dust, and hand-to-mouth contact with contaminated soil, than from the plant tissue itself. Growing food in lead-rich soil is risky because even relatively low soil lead levels can contribute to lead exposure. Soil with a total lead concentration of a few hundred parts per million (ppm) can result in produce that, if not properly handled, adds to lead ingestion. Since there is no physiological need for lead in our diet and any additional burden is harmful, conservative exposure limits are set. In the U.S., the EPA’s current guidance is to avoid planting food crops in soil that exceeds  ppm lead. Many university extensions recommend that if your soil tests high for lead, you should not use it for growing vegetables. Instead, mitigation measures include: For more detail on practical risk reduction and remediation (correction) measures, see the section “Best Practices for Growing Food in Contaminated Soil” towards the end of this article. Using Bioremediation to Remove Lead Contamination from Soils: It’s important to note that phytoextraction (bioremediation using plants) is not a quick fix for lead in soils. While certain plants (like some Brassica species or sunflowers) can uptake more lead than typical crops, lead’s limited bioavailability means remediation is a slow, difficult process​. Most of the lead remains in the ground or confined to roots, even after many growing cycles. Thus, trying to “clean” a vegetable plot by growing lead-accumulating plants would take many years and still leaves you with contaminated plant matter to dispose of. For home gardeners, removing the soil or covering it is usually more reliable than attempting to extract lead with plants​. In short, if your soil lead is high, the safest course is not to grow food in it without remediation – use safe soil or find a different site for your vegetable garden. If you suspect high lead levels in your soil, get it tested and err on the side of caution. Lead is a a toxic heavy metal and potent neurotoxin with no safe level of exposure that can affect almost every organ system, with the nervous system being its main target—especially in developing children. Even very low blood lead concentrations—just a few micrograms per deciliter—have been linked to developmental problems in children. Low levels of lead exposure can cause developmental delays, learning and behavior problems, reduced IQ, and attention disorders in children. In adults, chronic exposure to lead can contribute to high blood pressure, kidney damage, and reproductive problems. Importantly, the effects of lead are cumulative; lead stored in the body (for example, in bones) continues to cause harm over time. When produce grown in lead-contaminated soil is eaten, especially unwashed root or leafy vegetables, small amounts of lead can be ingested. Over time, continued exposure may contribute to elevated blood lead levels. The human body can accumulate lead by storing it in bones and organs, and even low doses may build up to harmful levels with repeated exposure. Children are particularly vulnerable because their developing brains and bodies are more sensitive to lead’s effects, and they absorb a higher fraction of ingested lead than adults. For example, young children playing in a lead-contaminated yard or garden may pick up lead-rich dirt on their hands and then ingest significant amounts of lead by putting their hands in their mouths, even if they are not consuming garden produce. This cumulative toxicity is why legacy lead in soil from sources such as past gasoline (petrol) use or paint remains a significant public health concern long after the original sources have ceased. Cadmium is a naturally occurring metal, but industrial activities have greatly increased its concentration in certain soils. Major sources of cadmium pollution include metal mining and smelting (cadmium is often a byproduct of zinc and lead refining), combustion of fossil fuels (coal burning can release cadmium), and application of phosphate fertilizers and sewage sludge to fields (both can contain cadmium). Cadmium was also used in some pigments and coatings. Along roadsides, cadmium can be deposited from tire and brake wear and from diesel emissions. In soil, cadmium strongly binds to organic matter and clay particles. It does not volatilize or degrade, though it can change chemical forms. Cadmium can travel through air as fine particles and eventually settle onto soil and water bodies, sometimes far from the source, due to wind transport. Importantly, cadmium is more readily taken up by plants than lead. Plant roots can absorb cadmium from soil, and it may accumulate in leaves, grains, and fruits to some extent. In fact, cadmium enters the food chain primarily through agriculture: leafy vegetables, grains, and legumes grown in cadmium-rich soils can have elevated cadmium levels​. For example, spinach, lettuce, and rice are known to sometimes accumulate cadmium from contaminated soils. Smoking tobacco is another significant exposure route, since tobacco plants readily uptake cadmium and smokers inhale it with cigarette smoke. Cadmium is highly toxic to kidneys. Long-term exposure, even at low levels, leads to cadmium accumulation in the body (particularly in the kidneys), which can result in kidney damage or kidney disease. Cadmium also causes bones to become fragile (a condition called itai-itai disease was observed in Japan due to cadmium-polluted rice causing severe osteoporosis and fractures). Inhalation of cadmium (e.g., occupational exposure in factories or from smoking) can damage the lungs. Cadmium is classified as a human carcinogen – it has been linked to lung cancer and is considered a probable human carcinogen by the EPA. Due to these risks, even relatively low concentrations of cadmium in soil are concerning if that soil is used to grow food. Mercury is unique among heavy metals for being liquid at room temperature (in its elemental form) and for its ability to vaporize and travel through the atmosphere. Mercury has been released into the environment from coal burning, mining (especially gold mining, which historically used mercury to extract gold), and industrial processes like chlor-alkali production. Along roads, mercury from car exhaust (small amounts from fuel impurities) and wear of certain components can contribute, but generally mercury soil hotspots are associated with industrial sites or spills. In the environment, mercury cycles through different forms. Elemental mercury can evaporate into air and travel long distances before redepositing. In soil, mercury tends to adhere strongly to soil and sediment particles. It does not degrade and can remain in topsoil or sediment for many years. Certain bacteria can transform inorganic mercury into organic forms, such as methylmercury, especially in waterlogged soils or sediments (like wetlands). Methylmercury is of particular concern because it can bioaccumulate in living organisms. Plants can absorb some mercury (especially methylmercury) from soil, and it can also deposit on plant surfaces from air. However, most human exposure to mercury comes not directly from soil, but from the consumption of fish and seafood in which mercury has bioaccumulated. That said, a mercury spill or high mercury content in soil is still dangerous: mercury vapor from soil can be inhaled, and mercury can leach into groundwater under certain conditions. All forms of mercury are toxic, with the nervous system and kidneys being primary targets. Methylmercury, which accumulates in the food chain, causes neurological damage – impairing coordination, vision, and cognitive development (famously illustrated by the Minamata mercury poisoning disease outbreaks in Japan in the s). Elemental mercury vapors can also cause tremors, memory loss, and organ damage with chronic exposure. Pregnant women and young children are most vulnerable, as mercury can cross the placenta and affect fetal brain development. While garden plants are unlikely to contain dangerous levels of mercury, contamination of soil with mercury requires careful management to prevent human contact and further environmental spread. Arsenic, which is actually a metalloid, is often discussed alongside heavy metals because of its similar toxicity and persistence. It occurs naturally in many soils at low concentrations (background levels are typically – ppm), but certain human activities have greatly increased arsenic levels in some locations. Historically, arsenic-based compounds were widely used in pesticides and herbicides – for example, lead arsenate was a common insecticide in fruit orchards in the early th century. Arsenic is also used as a wood preservative in chromated-copper-arsenate (CCA) treated timber and in some industrial processes such as glass manufacturing. Mining and smelting operations can release arsenic as well, since arsenic is often present in metal ores. In some regions, arsenic contamination is natural: certain geological formations lead to high arsenic groundwater which, when used for irrigation, can deposit arsenic into agricultural soil over time (which is why some groundwater shouldn’t ever be tapped into). In soil, arsenic tends to remain in inorganic forms (combined with oxygen, chlorine, or sulfur). It does not vaporize from soil, and while it can change form (for instance from one mineral form to another or to an organic form in plants), it doesn’t break down or disappear. Arsenic is relatively immobile in many soils – it often binds to iron oxides and clays and stays in the upper layers. However, changes in soil chemistry (like flooding or shifts in pH) can mobilize arsenic into water, causing it to move through the soil. Plants can take up arsenic from soil; certain ferns are known arsenic hyperaccumulators, and rice paddies (waterlogged soils) have been notorious for causing arsenic uptake into rice grains. Most crops, however, accumulate only limited arsenic in edible parts under normal conditions. The bigger risk is direct ingestion of arsenic-contaminated soil or dust, and use of arsenic-contaminated water. Arsenic is a well-known poison and carcinogen. Ingesting high doses of inorganic arsenic can be acutely (short-term) lethal. Chronic (long-term) exposure to lower doses causes a range of problems: skin pigmentation changes, keratosis (small corn-like growths on skin), peripheral neuropathy (a “pins and needles” feeling in hands and feet), and various organ damage. In the long term, arsenic in drinking water or food increases the risk of cancers, particularly skin, bladder, lung, and liver cancer. Health agencies like the EPA and WHO have set very low limits for arsenic in water ( μg/L, or . ppm, in drinking water) because of these cancer risks. Children exposed to arsenic may suffer developmental effects; some studies suggest lower IQ and increased child mortality with prolonged exposure to even moderate levels of arsenic. Unlike lead or mercury, arsenic does not preferentially attack the nervous system, but its systemic (whole body) effects and cancer risk make it extremely dangerous. In summary, heavy metals (and arsenic) persist in soils for centuries if not longer. They can be taken up to varying degrees by plants or move into groundwater, and they accumulate in animal and human bodies, causing chronic toxicity. Lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic each pose serious health hazards, from neurological damage and kidney failure to cancer. The presence of these metals in roadside and industrial soils is a cause for careful concern and management. Alongside metals, many polluted soils – especially near roads, factories, or fuel storage areas – contain organic contaminants known as hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are compounds made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. The ones of concern in contaminated soils typically come from petroleum and combustion processes. They can be broadly grouped into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs). These substances are notable for their persistence (resistance to breakdown) and potential toxicity. PAHs are a class of complex organic molecules consisting of multiple fused aromatic rings (flat, cyclic structures composed of carbon atoms with alternating double bonds and delocalized π electrons, giving them extra stability). They are generally produced by incomplete combustion of organic material. Common sources of PAHs include vehicle exhaust, coal and wood burning, waste incineration, and even charbroiling of food. They also occur in crude oil, tar, and asphalt. There are over  different PAH compounds; examples include naphthalene, benzo[a]pyrene, and anthracene. PAHs tend to be semi-volatile – they can exist attached to airborne particulates or as residues in soil and sediment. In soil, PAHs are quite persistent. Because they are hydrophobic (water-repelling), PAHs strongly bind to soil organic matter and clay particles. This means they don’t readily dissolve and wash away; instead, they remain in the soil, especially heavier PAHs with larger ring structures. Microorganisms can slowly degrade some PAHs, breaking them down over weeks to months, but the rate of breakdown decreases as the PAH size increases. High-molecular-weight PAHs (with four or more rings, like benzo[a]pyrene) are particularly resistant to biodegradation and can persist for years in the soil​ Lighter PAHs (two to three rings, like naphthalene or phenanthrene) are somewhat more prone to degradation or even evaporation. Sunlight can also help break down PAHs on soil surfaces (a process called photodegradation) over time. PAHs can migrate in the environment under certain conditions. While they mostly stick in place, some PAHs can leach through soil to contaminate groundwater – especially the lighter, more soluble ones. However, the majority tend to stay in the topsoil or move into sediments if carried by erosion. PAHs also have a tendency to bioaccumulate (build up in living organisms): plants and animals in contaminated areas can end up with PAH concentrations higher than those in the surrounding soil or water. For example, shellfish living in PAH-polluted waters concentrate PAHs in their tissues, and crops grown in PAH-contaminated soil may have PAH residues on or in them (mostly on surfaces or in fatty portions of plants). Many PAHs are toxic and several are known or suspected carcinogens. One of the most studied, benzo[a]pyrene, is classified as a human carcinogen and has been linked to lung and skin cancers in exposed populations. In general, PAHs can cause cellular damage through the formation of reactive metabolites that bind to DNA. Environmental exposure to mixtures of PAHs (for example, breathing highway soot or ingesting soot-contaminated soil) has been associated with increased cancer risk. Besides cancer, PAHs can also harm aquatic life and soil microorganisms. They can cause developmental and reproductive problems in wildlife. It’s worth noting that typical environmental PAH levels from urban soil or air are low, and the health effects of chronic low-level exposure are still being studied. But at contaminated sites (like old gas manufacturing plants or creosote-treated areas), PAH levels in soil can be very high and pose acute risks to health if not managed. Petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) refer broadly to the mixture of hydrocarbons found in crude oil and petroleum products (gasoline/petrol, diesel, kerosene, etc.). PHCs in soil typically come from oil spills, leaking underground storage tanks, pipeline ruptures, or chronic drips and emissions from vehicles. This category includes a wide range of chemicals, from light volatile compounds like butane and benzene to heavy oils and tars. Two important subcategories of PHCs are aliphatic hydrocarbons (which include alkanes and alkenes) and aromatic hydrocarbons (like benzene, toluene, and larger PAHs discussed above). Aromatics vs. Aliphatics: In petroleum, aromatic hydrocarbons (like BTEX compounds benzene, toluene, xylenes, and PAHs) are often the most toxic components. Benzene, for example, is a known carcinogen. Aromatics are more soluble in water and more bioavailable than large alkanes, which means they can more readily contaminate groundwater and enter living organisms​. They also tend to be more resistant to biodegradation if they have complex structures. Aliphatic hydrocarbons (straight-chain or branched alkanes, and alkenes) can be degraded by soil bacteria under the right conditions – indeed many oil-degrading microbes will preferentially consume simpler alkanes first. However, heavy oil residues (long-chain alkanes) can remain for years as well, especially if oxygen is limited. BTEX is an acronym that stands for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. These compounds are classified as aromatic hydrocarbons. Each of the compounds contains one or more benzene rings, which is the defining characteristic of aromatic compounds. These volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are commonly found in petroleum products and are often associated with petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in soil and groundwater. Here are some key points about BTEX compounds: BTEX compounds are particularly concerning because of their toxicity, their ability to migrate easily through soils and into groundwater, and their potential to volatilize into the air. Due to these factors, they are often monitored in environmental assessments and are a key focus in remediation efforts at contaminated sites. The persistence of a given petroleum hydrocarbon in soil depends on its molecular weight, structure, and environmental conditions. Light hydrocarbons (short-chain alkanes, small aromatics) might evaporate or be biodegraded in days to months. Heavy hydrocarbons (like those in crude oil or bunker fuel) can persist for many years, especially if they penetrate into subsurface soil where less oxygen is available. A spill of oil can leave behind an “aged” contamination where the lighter fractions have evaporated or degraded, leaving a tarry mix of heavy alkanes and PAHs that can persist for decades. Even when biodegradable, PHCs can create long-term issues because they can kill vegetation and soil life upon initial contamination – for example, a diesel spill might sterilize soil microbes in the area, reducing soil fertility. Over time, natural attenuation (biodegradation) often reduces the concentrations, but the intermediate breakdown products might still be harmful. Regarding human health, the risk depends on the specific compounds present: for instance, benzene in soil can evaporate and be inhaled, posing cancer and blood-disorder risks; PAHs in soil dust can be carcinogenic if ingested or inhaled; and even some aliphatic hydrocarbons can cause skin irritation or neurological effects with sufficient exposure. Many petroleum products also have additive chemicals (like solvents, or lead in the old leaded gasoline) that compound the hazard. In essence, the mixture of hydrocarbons in contaminated soils, whether from exhaust particles or oil spills, tends to stick around and can slowly leach or emit vapors. Both heavy metals and these persistent hydrocarbons often co-occur in soils near roads and industries (for example, lead and PAHs from traffic, or arsenic and diesel-range organics at old industrial sites). This combination can create complex risks for the environment and human health. One should also note that contaminated sites often have mixed exposures. For example, an industrial site might have both lead and PAHs in soil; the combination can be particularly harmful because multiple organs and systems are targeted by different toxins. Moreover, socioeconomic factors play a role – low-income communities are often closer to industrial areas or busy highways and thus more likely to be exposed to these soil hazards, compounding health disparities. When heavy metals and hydrocarbons accumulate in soil, they can significantly disrupt local ecosystems. Soil is not just an inert medium – it’s a living environment filled with microbes, fungi, insects, and plant roots. Heavy metal contamination can reduce soil biodiversity by poisoning sensitive microorganisms and soil fauna. For example, elevated mercury or cadmium levels can alter the soil microbial community, inhibiting beneficial bacteria and fungi that are crucial for nutrient cycling​. Plants growing in contaminated soil may experience stunted growth or yield reductions due to metal toxicity interfering with physiological processes (such as enzyme function and nutrient uptake). Some plants, however, tolerate or even accumulate heavy metals – these differences in plant response are exploited in phytoremediation strategies (using plants like certain ferns or alpine pennycress to extract metals from soil). Nonetheless, in a natural setting, heavy metal presence generally leads to lower plant diversity and can allow only metal-tolerant species to thrive, reducing overall ecosystem health. Hydrocarbon pollution in soil similarly harms soil life. Fresh petroleum hydrocarbons can be particularly damaging – they may coat soil particles and create oxygen-poor conditions, killing aerobic microbes and small invertebrates (like earthworms) in the contaminated zone. The result is often a patch of soil where normal decomposition and nutrient cycling are halted, leading to what is sometimes called “soil sterilization.” In aquatic ecosystems, runoff carrying PAHs or oil can be toxic to fish, amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates. Many PAHs cause mutations or cancers in wildlife; for instance, PAH-contaminated sediments have been linked to tumors in bottom-dwelling fish in polluted waterways. Hydrocarbon contaminants can also bioaccumulate: small organisms like worms may accumulate PAHs or other chemicals, which then move up the food chain to birds or mammals. Contaminants in soil also threaten groundwater and surface water quality. Rainwater percolating through contaminated soil can carry soluble contaminants downward. Arsenic, for instance, can leach into groundwater under certain geochemical conditions, leading to contaminated wells. Nitrates and salts typically leach more readily than heavy metals, but metals like cadmium and zinc can move if the soil pH changes or if they form soluble complexes. Some petroleum hydrocarbons, notably the benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) compounds in gasoline (petrol), are moderately soluble in water and can migrate to groundwater – this is a common problem at leaking underground fuel tank sites. Even heavier oil components can reach groundwater in non-aqueous phase form, creating a lasting source of pollution that slowly dissolves into the water over time​. Once contaminants reach groundwater, they can spread out as a plume, potentially tainting drinking water wells or discharging into streams and lakes. Ecosystems downstream may then be exposed to these pollutants. For example, arsenic or lead in groundwater can accumulate in sediments of a creek, affecting aquatic organisms; or a PAH plume seeping into a river can harm fish and make the fish unsafe for predators (including humans) to eat. Another environmental risk is the transfer of soil contaminants into the food chain. Plants growing in contaminated soil can take up certain heavy metals (especially cadmium and arsenic) into their roots, shoots, or fruits. When herbivores eat those plants, the metals enter their bodies, and can then move on to predators. Mercury provides a classic case of this: inorganic mercury from soil or water is converted by bacteria into methylmercury, which then accumulates in aquatic organisms and biomagnifies in each step of the food chain, reaching high concentrations in top predators like large fish. Humans who eat those fish are then exposed to potentially harmful mercury levels. Lead and arsenic do not biomagnify to the same extent, but chickens foraging on lead-contaminated soils, for instance, can have elevated lead in their eggs; cows grazing on polluted pastures could accumulate cadmium in their liver and kidneys over time. Similarly, animals can accumulate hydrocarbons. Grazing animals may ingest soil along with grass – if the soil contains PAHs or oil residues, some of that ingested material can be absorbed. Insects and worms in contaminated soil may concentrate PAHs, and insect-eating birds or mammals can thus dose themselves with those chemicals. While most hydrocarbon compounds will be metabolized or excreted by higher animals (unlike metals, they don’t permanently accumulate in tissues as much), continuous exposure can still cause chronic poisoning or increased cancer risk in wildlife. Urban agriculture and gardening in areas with a history of industrial or roadside contamination require thoughtful planning and proactive management. Although soils may contain heavy metals or hydrocarbons, effective strategies exist to minimize exposure and and make gardening safer. Below are some key best practices to help you manage soil contamination while growing healthy, edible plants. . Test Your Soil: Before planting edible gardens in urban or suspect areas, it’s wise to test the soil for common contaminants. Contact a soil testing laboratory (many government departments or university extension services offer this) and request analyses for heavy metals like lead, cadmium, and arsenic. If the site is near a roadway or former gas station, testing for petroleum hydrocarbons or PAHs may be warranted as well. Knowing your soil’s contaminant levels is the first step in managing risk. . Use Raised Beds with Clean Soil: One of the simplest and most effective strategies for growing food safely is to use raised garden beds filled with clean, uncontaminated soil or compost. By importing clean topsoil/compost and elevating the growing area above the native soil, you create a barrier between plant roots and the contaminated ground​. Make sure to line the bottom of raised beds with landscape fabric or another barrier such as root barrier plastic if there’s concern that roots might penetrate or that soil might mix. Raised beds also have the benefit of being easier to manage and can improve drainage. . Cover Bare Soil and Reduce Dust: If you have contaminated soil areas in your yard, keep them covered to prevent windblown dust and direct contact. Apply a layer of mulch around -cm (- inches) thick, or plant groundcover vegetation on bare soil​. This is particularly important around play areas for children. By covering the soil, you minimize the chances of contaminated dust sticking to vegetables or being inhaled. Also avoid tracking soil into the house – remove gardening shoes outside and use doormats. . Soil Amendments – Compost and pH Adjustment: Mixing substantial amounts of organic matter (compost) into soil can help dilute contaminants and bind heavy metals, making them less bioavailable. Note: While compost and pH control help, they do not remove soil contaminants – they simply stabilize them. The produce grown should still be handled carefully. . Crop Selection and Gardening Practices: If your soil has elevated heavy metals or PAHs but you still wish to garden in it, be strategic about what and how you grow: . Hygiene and Harvest Handling: Practice good hygiene to avoid ingesting soil particles: Remediation for the Long Term: If testing shows very high contamination (for instance, lead levels in the thousands of ppm, or a large oil spill), you should look into remediation options: By following these recommendations, the risks of gardening in contaminated urban soil can be greatly reduced. In fact, many community gardens have been successfully established on remediated brownfields or filled with clean soil over contaminated ground. The key is to know what’s in your soil, to keep contaminants out of your plants and mouth, and improve the soil conditions to minimize contaminant availability. In conclusion, heavy metal and hydrocarbon contamination is a lasting legacy of industrial and automotive activities that continues to pose risks to ecosystems and human health. Contaminants like lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, and PAHs persist in soils for decades, interfering with plant growth, reducing soil health, and entering the food chain. Despite progress in reducing such pollution, legacy contamination remains a serious concern. Through awareness, testing, proper gardening practices, and remediation where needed, it is possible to manage these risks. Healthy gardening means using safe soil to protect both our environment and public health.";Deep Green Permaculture
"NZ spinach, also known as Warrigal greens, is a hardy perennial leafy green that thrives in hot, dry conditions where conventional spinach often fails. It can be grown as a warm-season stand-in for traditional spinach. This sprawling, heat-tolerant ground-cover plant with a prostrate growing habit produces low, branching stems that typically creep or trail – cm (– ft) across. Its fleshy, triangular (deltoid to rhombic) leaves, usually – cm long and – cm wide, have a succulent-like texture and are covered in tiny water-storing bladders, giving them a slightly shimmering or “blistered” appearance. Both the thick leaves and stems are salt-spray tolerant, making NZ spinach ideal for coastal gardens. Highly resilient, NZ spinach often grows well in sandy or poor soils and requires little watering once established. Its succulent leaves store water, enabling the plant to withstand drier conditions. In coastal areas, it can tolerate some salinity due to its seaside origins. However, consistent watering in a garden setting provides the most tender and abundant foliage, especially if you plan on harvesting repeatedly. Under warm conditions, small yellowish-green flowers appear in the leaf axils (where leaf stems grow from the branch), eventually forming seed pods with hard, ridged exteriors. While many gardeners treat NZ spinach as an annual, it can act as a short-lived perennial in frost-free climates and will readily self-seed if the seed pods are left on the plant. In some regions, this self-seeding can be quite vigorous. Though not generally considered invasive, those looking to limit spread may remove spent seed heads. Conversely, gardeners wishing to keep a self-sustaining patch can allow a few pods to mature and ensure volunteer seedlings. Although NZ spinach is not a true spinach, it offers a similar flavor and texture, making it an excellent substitute in recipes that call for spinach. The leaves do contain oxalates, so if you plan to eat them frequently, blanching beforehand helps reduce oxalate levels. NZ spinach (Warrigal greens) is a warm-season crop that grows in temperatures ranging from about –°C (–°F), with the optimal growing range around –°C (–°F). It prefers sunny conditions, though it can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter regions. Below about °C (°F), growth slows significantly, and frost can damage or kill the plant. In cooler climates, sow seeds or plant cuttings after the last frost date. NZ spinach is more tolerant of heat than typical spinach, making it a good summer alternative in many areas. Soil should be moderately fertile, well-drained, and kept consistently moist, but avoid oversaturation, as waterlogged conditions can hamper root development. Pre-soaking seeds in water for a few hours or overnight can improve germination rates. The ridged, firm seed coat benefits from softening before sowing. Additionally, sow seeds in clumps of two or three, thinning to the strongest seedling per clump once they’re a few centimeters tall. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location NZ spinach (Warrigal greens) can be used in many dishes similarly to spinach, though it has a mild salty, slightly tangy note and a more succulent texture. Preparation
Because Warrigal greens have oxalate crystals on their leaves, a quick blanch or soak in hot water is recommended. This simple step helps remove any gritty texture or bitterness and neutralizes the oxalates. After blanching, you can safely use the leaves raw or cooked, depending on your recipe. Cooking Suggestions Flavor Pairings
Warrigal greens’ natural saltiness is easily balanced by sweet, acidic, or spicy elements—think garlic, chili, or citrus. If you find the flavor too mild, intensify it by cooking with robust seasonings like smoked paprika or strong cheeses. In Australia, some people highlight Warrigal greens as part of native bushfood cuisine, celebrating its adaptability and local heritage. Internationally, it finds place as a novel “spinach alternative,” especially in hot-summer regions. Whether whipped into creamy dips, folded into omelets, or served with grains, NZ spinach provides a versatile, nutritious leafy component that is reliably available in the warmer seasons. With proper blanching and imaginative recipes, it readily stands alongside other staple greens as a valuable part of the culinary repertoire. In conclusion, NZ spinach (Warrigal greens) offers a hardy, heat-tolerant solution for those seeking leafy greens in warmer climates or extended summer conditions. By giving it room to sprawl, maintaining moderate moisture, and occasionally blanching leaves before use, gardeners and cooks can enjoy a steady supply of flavorful, drought-resilient greens throughout the season.";Deep Green Permaculture
"Calathea plants, belonging to the Marantaceae family, are celebrated for their stunning foliage, featuring vibrant patterns and colors. Often referred to as prayer plants, Calatheas are prized for their ability to fold their leaves at night and reopen them during the day, adding an element of movement to their visual appeal. While they are somewhat demanding in their care requirements, the reward of their striking leaves makes the effort worthwhile. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about Calathea care, ensuring these beautiful plants thrive in your home. Scientific Name: Calathea spp. Origin and Description: Calatheas are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their large, decorative leaves. The leaves can come in various shades of green, purple, pink, and white, often with intricate patterns. Different species of Calathea, such as Calathea lancifolia (Rattlesnake Plant), Calathea orbifolia, and Calathea ornata (Pinstripe Plant), offer a diverse range of leaf designs. Typically, these plants grow up to cm ( feet) tall, making them suitable for indoor environments. Benefits: Beyond their aesthetic appeal, Calatheas are known for their air-purifying qualities, helping to filter indoor air and improve overall air quality. Their unique leaf movements also make them a fascinating addition to any indoor plant collection. Watering Needs: Calatheas prefer consistently moist soil but are sensitive to overwatering. Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch, using distilled or rainwater to avoid the fluoride and chlorine found in tap water, which can cause leaf browning. Ensure that the pot has good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Soil and Potting: A well-draining, peat-based potting mix is ideal for Calatheas. A mix designed for African violets or a combination of peat moss, perlite, and potting soil can work well. Repotting should be done every - years to refresh the soil and provide room for growth. When repotting, be gentle with the roots as they can be delicate. Light Requirements and Lux Levels: Calatheas thrive in bright, indirect light but can adapt to a range of lighting conditions. Using a lux meter to measure light intensity can help you determine the best spot for your Calathea, ensuring it receives the appropriate amount of light without being exposed to harsh direct sunlight. Temperature and Humidity: Calatheas thrive in warm, humid environments. They prefer temperatures between °C to °C (°F and °F) and high humidity levels, ideally above %. To increase humidity, consider placing a humidifier nearby, grouping plants together, or placing the plant on a pebble tray filled with water. Fertilisation and Pruning: Feed your Calathea with a balanced, water-soluble fertiliser diluted to half strength every - weeks during the growing season (spring and summer), reducing feeding in the autumn and winter when the plant’s growth slows, or use a solid slow-release solid fertiliser that comes in pellets or prills (little round balls) in spring. Pruning is minimal; simply remove any yellow or brown leaves to keep the plant looking healthy. Calatheas, with their strikingly patterned leaves and vibrant colors, are a popular choice among indoor plant enthusiasts. Propagating Calatheas can be a rewarding way to expand your collection or share these beautiful plants with friends. The most reliable and commonly used method to propagate Calatheas is through division. Here’s a detailed guide on how to propagate Calatheas successfully.

This will make it easier to remove from the pot and help reduce stress on the plant. Step : Remove the Plant from Its Pot – Carefully remove the Calathea from its pot. Gently turn the pot upside down while supporting the base of the plant with your hand, and tap the bottom to loosen the root ball. Be gentle to avoid damaging the roots. Step : Inspect and Divide the Root Ball – Place the plant on a tarp or old newspaper. Examine the root ball and look for natural divisions or clumps. Calatheas often have multiple stems that can be separated. Use your hands or a clean, sharp knife to carefully divide the plant into sections. Each section should have several leaves and a healthy portion of roots. Step : Repot the Divisions – Fill new pots with fresh potting mix. Place each division into its own pot, ensuring that the roots are well-covered with soil. Firmly press the soil around the base of the plant to provide support. Leave some space at the top of the pot for watering. Step : Water and Settle the New Plants – Water the newly potted divisions thoroughly to help settle the soil around the roots. Ensure the soil is evenly moist but not waterlogged. Step : Provide the Right Environment – Place the new pots in a location with bright, indirect light. Maintain high humidity levels to encourage growth and reduce stress on the divided plants. This can be achieved by misting the plants regularly, placing a humidifier nearby, or using a pebble tray with water. By following these propagation methods and care tips, you can successfully propagate Calatheas and enjoy their stunning foliage in various parts of your home or share them with friends and family. With the right care, your new Calathea plants will thrive and bring vibrant beauty to your indoor spaces. Calatheas can be susceptible to pests such as spider mites, aphids, and mealybugs, especially in dry conditions. Regularly inspect your plant and treat any infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil.

Have you ever wondered what exactly is in the products you use every day? Many of us are surprised to learn that some common personal care and household items may contain phthalates—chemicals used to make plastics flexible and to help scents last longer. While you might never see “phthalates” printed on your favorite shampoo or air freshener, knowing what to look for can empower you to make safer choices for yourself and your family. In this guide, we’ll break down where these chemicals hide, how to spot them on labels, and share practical tips for switching to phthalate-free alternatives. Let’s take a friendly, straightforward look at how you can create a healthier, toxin-reduced home environment. This section covers some chemistry, which may seem a little technical. The simple explanation is that phthalates are synthetic chemicals manufactured in laboratories, all derived from a key industrial compound called phthalic acid. Phthalic acid is an aromatic compound which in chemistry means it contains a stable, ring-like structure of carbon atoms. However, it is important to note that phthalic acid is not a benign substance—it is an irritant to the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, and respiratory tract, and at high concentrations, it can exert narcotic effects acting as a CNS (central nervous system) depressant. Phthalates are made by combining phthalic acid with different types of alcohols. Phthalic acid has two special areas on its structure (called carboxyl groups) that can react with alcohol molecules. When these spots join with alcohol, they form a new compound called a diester—this process (the chemical reaction of an acid with an alcohol) is known as esterification . The end product produced, the phthalate, is an effective plasticizer compound that can be added to plastics to make them softer and more flexible, enhancing their durability. These modifications of chemical structure to create the phthalate compounds however, also impart undesirable chemical properties including endocrine disruption that can interfere with hormone systems, and long-term environmental persistence, raising concerns about both health and ecological impacts. Note: Skip to the next section if the more complex chemistry that follows is of no interest! Phthalates are diesters of phthalic acid, also known as ,-benzenedicarboxylic acid, with the chemical structure CH(COOH)—an aromatic dicarboxylic acid. Their general chemical structure involves a benzene ring with two carboxylic acid groups, each esterified with an alcohol-derived side chain. The variation in these side chains (alkyl groups) gives rise to the diverse range of phthalate compounds. Phthalates are primarily used as plasticizers—substances added to plastics to increase their flexibility, durability, and workability. Their applications span numerous industries: The ubiquitous presence of phthalates in consumer and industrial products has made them an integral component of modern manufacturing, despite growing concerns over their potential adverse effects. Phthalates have played a significant role in modern industrial and consumer applications, evolving alongside advances in manufacturing and changes in regulatory landscapes. Phthalates are of significant concern from a toxicological perspective due to their potential to interfere with human endocrine (hormone) systems and other biological processes. These health concerns are documented in numerous toxicological reviews and reports by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and similar bodies. However, some associations remain under active investigation, and conclusions are based on a combination of epidemiological and experimental evidence (internal knowledge base, NIEHS summaries). Phthalates are not only a concern for human health but also for the environment. Their environmental behavior and persistence contribute to widespread ecological exposure. Environmental risk assessments have been conducted by agencies like the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the U.S. EPA, among others. Detailed studies can be found in environmental science journals and regulatory review documents (internal knowledge base, EPA/ECHA risk assessment reports). The environmental half‐lives of phthalates can vary considerably depending on the specific compound and the environmental compartment (water, soil, or sediment), as well as conditions such as temperature, pH, oxygen availability, and microbial activity. Note: There is a difference between a chemical’s half-life, the time it takes to reduce to %, and how long it takes to be eliminated. When discussing elimination in environmental conditions, a common rule-of-thumb is that it takes roughly seven half-lives for a compound to decrease to less than % of its original concentration. Using a formula for exponential decay, After seven half-lives, approximately .% of the original amount remains. Below are estimated elimination times for phthalates in different environmental media based on typical half-life values: Some lower-molecular-weight phthalates (e.g., diethyl phthalate, DEP) can have half-lives on the order of hours to a few days under aerobic conditions, thanks to microbial degradation and photolysis. In contrast, more hydrophobic phthalates like DEHP may partition out of the water phase more quickly, limiting degradation in the aqueous phase. It’s important to note that these figures are approximate and can vary widely based on specific environmental settings and the exact phthalate in question. Some phthalates may also undergo transformation to intermediate compounds that have their own persistence and toxicity profiles. Consumers can take practical steps to reduce their exposure to phthalates in everyday items by focusing on products used in personal care and within the household. Below are strategies and tips for identifying, avoiding, and selecting products less likely to contain phthalates: Research indicates that many scented cleaning products and personal care items may contain phthalates as additives, and it’s helpful to understand how these compounds are used and what alternatives might be available. By being aware of these distinctions, consumers can make more informed choices—such as opting for products labeled “phthalate-free” or those that specifically highlight the use of natural ingredients—to reduce potential exposure to these chemicals. By being vigilant about ingredient lists, favoring products that clearly state they are “phthalate-free,” and choosing natural or unscented alternatives when possible, consumers can effectively reduce their exposure to these chemicals. This proactive approach is key to making healthier choices in both personal care and household products. In conclusion, although phthalates have contributed significantly to the performance and durability of modern plastic materials, their potential health and environmental risks make it important to understand where they are found and how to minimize exposure to them.;Deep Green Permaculture

"Sweet corn is an annual warm-season grass grown for its tender, sweet kernels. Plants typically reach .–. m (– ft) in height with upright, jointed stems. Long, narrow leaves alternate along the stalk, with prominent leaf sheaths enclosing part of the stem. Sweet corn bears separate male (tassels) and female (silks) flowers on the same plant; pollinated silks develop into ears containing rows of kernels. Each ear is encased in husks and topped by threads of silk. Seeds (kernels) range in color from yellow or white to bi-colored varieties, reflecting different cultivars. Sweet corn completes its life cycle in a single growing season and is harvested at the “milk stage,” when kernels are plump and full of sweet, milky juice. Sweet corn is specifically bred for its tender, high-sugar kernels that are enjoyed as a fresh vegetable, while other corn types serve different purposes. Popcorn, for instance, has a hard outer shell that allows it to pop when heated, and field corn is cultivated for its high starch content, making it ideal for animal feed, industrial processing, or milling into flour. Ornamental corn, on the other hand, is grown primarily for its colorful appearance rather than for eating. Essentially, the primary distinction lies in their breeding: sweet corn is optimized for flavor and tenderness, whereas other varieties are selected for structural characteristics, processing qualities, or aesthetic appeal. Sweet corn is monoecious, meaning it produces both male and female flowers on the same stalk but in distinct structures: Once the silks have been successfully pollinated, kernels grow and mature over the following weeks. Proper pollination is crucial for full, evenly filled ears of sweet corn. Sweet corn is a warm-season crop that grows best in temperatures ranging from –°C (–°F), with the optimal growing temperature around –°C (–°F). It requires warm soil and consistent sunlight to develop full, sweet kernels, making late spring to early summer the preferred planting time after all danger of frost has passed. Sweet corn is frost-sensitive, and sustained temperatures below °C (°F) can stunt its growth and reduce kernel formation. In cooler regions or where growing seasons are short, starting seeds indoors – weeks before the last frost date and transplanting them outdoors when soil temperatures reach at least °C (°F) can improve the likelihood of a successful harvest. Like other grasses, sweet corn thrives in fertile, well-drained soil with regular watering, ensuring the roots do not dry out during critical pollination and ear-fill stages. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Stalk lodging is when the cornstalk bends or breaks—often near ground level—leading the plant to fall over, usually due to wind, heavy rain, or other stress factors. While sweet corn generally develops sturdy stalks, it can still be prone to lodging under heavy winds or intense storms. Lodging occurs when stalks are blown down or bent, which can hamper pollination and reduce overall yield. Planting corn in blocks rather than single rows offers more mutual support among stalks, cutting down on wind damage. If lodging does occur, gently hill soil around the base or provide temporary staking for stability until the plants recover. Keeping rows weed-free is also important, as excessive weed competition can weaken stalks and make them more likely to topple. Sweet corn is easily cross-pollinated by other corn types, including popcorn, field corn, and even other sweet corn varieties, which can reduce flavor quality, alter kernel texture, and change kernel color. Cross-pollination directly affects the ears produced in the current season. The kernels that develop on those ears reflect the genetic contribution from any pollen donor, so their flavor, texture, and color may change immediately. Additionally, if you save seeds from these ears, the next generation seeds will inherit those mixed traits. For instance, if sweet corn tassels coincide with popcorn tassels, the resulting ears may become tougher and starchier. Similarly, supersweet (sh) and augmented supersweet cultivars can lose their distinctive sweetness if pollinated by standard (su), sugary enhanced (se), or synergistic (sy) corn types. Even color purity can be affected: white kernel varieties pollinated by yellow or bi-color corn will develop yellow kernels, and bi-color varieties can show more yellow if pollinated by a yellow variety. To prevent these issues, isolation is key. This can be done in two primary ways: On a small-scale or in controlled settings, hand-pollinating and bagging the tassels and ears can effectively prevent unwanted cross-pollination, ensuring that only the desired pollen fertilizes the silks. However, these techniques are labor-intensive and require careful timing and handling to ensure successful pollination, so they are most practical for gardeners focused on seed saving or achieving specific crop characteristics. For many home gardeners with limited space, growing only one sweet corn type each season is a simple alternative that eliminates cross-pollination concerns. By carefully planning planting dates and placing corn blocks strategically, you can preserve the sweetness, texture, and color purity of your chosen sweet corn varieties. The Three Sisters Guild is a traditional interplanting system widely used by various Native American peoples. It involves growing corn, beans, and squash together in mounds, creating a mutually supportive relationship among the three crops. Planting Method How It Works This synergistic planting method showcases how each crop benefits the others, reducing the need for external inputs like synthetic fertilizers, minimizing weed competition, and maximizing use of garden space—all while honoring a time-tested, indigenous agricultural tradition. Harvest Time: Sweet corn is ready to harvest when silks turn brown and dry at the ear tip and the kernels exude a milky liquid when gently pierced with a thumbnail. This “milk stage” typically occurs – weeks after planting, depending on the variety. Harvest promptly once the ears reach this stage, as sweetness declines rapidly if left on the stalk, and overmature sweet corn becomes tough and doughy. When sweet corn is still immature and not yet at the ideal “milk stage,” the ear is not completely filled with kernels, and when you puncture the kernels, they typically release a clear, watery liquid rather than the creamy, milky fluid associated with fully mature ears. Most hybrid varieties of sweet corn produce two ears per plant, and the upper ear usually matures  or  days before the lower ear. Harvesting Tips: Grasp the ear firmly near the base, then twist downward to snap it off. Peel back a small section of the husk to check kernel maturity if unsure. For maximum sweetness, harvest in the morning when sugar content is naturally higher. Refrigerate or cook ears soon after picking for best flavor. Storage: Sweet corn should be used or refrigerated immediately after harvest, as its quality declines rapidly. Standard sweet corn (su) varieties can lose up to % of its sugar content within  hours if not cooled. Under optimal conditions, °C (°F) with % relative humidity, sweet corn generally maintains quality for  to  days. Depending on the genetic type, some varieties, such as sugar-enhanced (se) and supersweet (sh) types, convert sugar to starch more slowly, allowing them to retain their sweetness for one to seven days or longer. For longer-term preservation, freezing is an excellent option. Produce New Plants From: Seeds When saving corn seed, several factors must be considered. To preserve the desired qualities, isolate your corn patch by around one hundred meters or use methods like hand-pollinating and bagging, or simply grow a single variety in your garden. Baby corn, which resembles a miniature version of regular corn, is harvested when the ears are immature—typically measuring – cm (– inches) in length and .–. cm (/–/ inch) in diameter at the base. Because the cob has not fully hardened, baby corn can be eaten whole, offering a unique texture compared to full-size corn. Although there are specialty varieties bred specifically for producing more baby corn per stalk, most baby corn is grown from standard sweet or field corn. The taste of immature corn varies little between varieties; the main differences lie in size, texture, and the fact that the corn is consumed in its entirely tender, undeveloped state. Typically, most sweet corn varieties reach the baby corn stage just  to  days after the silks first appear, making them a popular choice in restaurants and gourmet food stores. Virtually all sweet corn varieties on the market are hybrids, as indicated by the “F” in their names. These first-generation hybrids are produced by crossing two distinct parent lines to combine desirable traits such as improved vigor, enhanced disease resistance, and greater overall performance—qualities that are hard to maintain in open-pollinated varieties. (Note: If you plan to save seeds, avoid F hybrids since their progeny will not reliably reproduce the parent characteristics; instead, choose open-pollinated, heirloom varieties.) Home gardeners have a wide array of sweet corn options that differ in kernel color, sugar content, texture, ear size, days to harvest, and storage life. Broadly, sweet corn can be classified into five main types, each with its own set of characteristics: Each type offers unique benefits, allowing gardeners to choose the sweet corn that best suits their local growing conditions, desired harvest timing, and culinary preferences. Sweet corn is a staple ingredient in many cuisines worldwide, prized for its natural sweetness, tender texture, and versatility. Whether eaten fresh, cooked, or preserved, it can be used in a wide range of dishes, from simple home-cooked meals to gourmet creations. Below are some of the most popular ways to prepare and enjoy sweet corn. Fresh and Cooked Preparations:
Freshly harvested sweet corn is best enjoyed when cooked soon after picking, as its sugars begin converting to starch over time.

It is also frequently used in casseroles, rice dishes, and baked gratins, where its natural juiciness enhances the dish’s overall moisture and flavor. In some cuisines, sweet corn is even combined with cheese or cream sauces for indulgent, savory baked dishes. Creamed Corn and Corn-Based Side Dishes:
One of the most traditional uses of sweet corn is creamed corn, where the kernels are blended with milk or cream for a smooth, rich texture. This dish is commonly served as a side with barbecued meats, roasts, or fried foods. Other corn-based side dishes include polenta and grits, which use ground cornmeal but sometimes incorporate fresh sweet corn kernels for added texture. Baked Goods and Snacks:
Sweet corn is also used in baking, where its subtle sweetness enhances cornbread, muffins, pancakes, and even cakes. Fresh kernels can be mixed into batters to provide bursts of flavor and moisture. Additionally, sweet corn can be processed into corn fritters or hush puppies, which are deep-fried for a crispy, flavorful snack. In some regions, sweet corn is even used in desserts, such as corn pudding or custards, where its natural sugars contribute to a creamy, mild sweetness. Preservation: Freezing, Canning, and Drying:
To enjoy sweet corn year-round, home cooks and commercial producers use various preservation methods. Freezing is one of the best ways to retain its fresh taste—blanching the kernels before freezing helps preserve their texture and nutrients. Canning is another popular method, with whole-kernel corn or creamed corn stored in jars for later use. In some cultures, sweet corn is even dried and ground into cornmeal for making tamales, tortillas, or other staple foods. Sweet corn is a beloved ingredient across many cultures. In Latin American cuisine, it appears in tamales, corn-based stews, and grilled elote, a street food featuring corn-on-the-cob coated with cheese, spices, and lime. In Asia, sweet corn is found in soups, stir-fries, and even desserts, such as sweet corn ice cream. In Southern and American cuisine, it plays a central role in dishes like cornbread, succotash, and chowders. Each region has its own way of incorporating sweet corn into traditional meals, making it one of the most adaptable and widely enjoyed vegetables in the world. From fresh cobs to creamy soups, stir-fries, and baked goods, sweet corn’s versatility makes it a valuable ingredient in countless recipes.

Pomegranates don’t continue to ripen after being picked, so harvesting at the right time is crucial for the best flavour and juiciness. Unlike many fruits that soften when ripe, pomegranates remain firm, meaning you’ll need to rely on visual and physical cues to determine their readiness. From changes in color and shape to the subtle curling of the calyx at the base, here’s how to know when your pomegranates are at peak ripeness. Final Tip: Harvest at the Right Time – Since pomegranates don’t ripen after being picked, it’s best to wait until they show multiple signs of ripeness before harvesting to ensure the best flavour. Carefully cut the fruit from the tree to avoid damaging the stem or nearby branches. Unripe pomegranates have a significantly different taste compared to ripe ones. Here’s how they compare: Unripe Pomegranates: Ripe Pomegranates: Unripe pomegranates can still be used in cooking, such as making tart sauces or adding acidity to dishes, but they are generally not enjoyable to eat raw compared to fully ripe ones.;Deep Green Permaculture
Kohlrabi is a biennial vegetable most often grown as an annual for its swollen, globe-like stem, which is smooth, firm, resembles a turnip in appearance, and forms just above the soil surface. This enlarged stem—commonly called a “bulb,” though technically a thickened portion of the stem—can grow up to  cm ( in) in diameter and may be green, white, or purple in color, depending on the variety. All kohl rabi bulbs, regardless of their external color, are white or pale green inside. The kohlrabi bulb has a crisp texture and pleasantly mild sweetness, and is are often compared to a sweeter, milder version of broccoli stems or turnips. The plant typically reaches – cm (– in) in height with a similar spread. It has long, bluish-green waxy leaves with long petioles (leaf stems), which sprout radially as a rosette from the sides of the bulb. These leaves are also edible and can be cooked as leafy greens. If left to mature into its second year, kohlrabi produces a tall flowering stalk with small, yellow, four-petaled flowers characteristic of the Brassica family. These flowers develop into seed pods containing small, round seeds (– mm in diameter) that are dark brown to black. Sometimes referred to as turnip-rooted cabbage or German cabbage, kohlrabi originated in Europe. The plant is highly versatile in the kitchen, used in both raw forms, such as salads and slaws, and cooked preparations, where it retains its crispness and mild flavor. Kohlrabi thrives in cool weather and can be grown successfully in a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for home gardeners. Kohlrabi is a cool-season crop that thrives in cool climates, in temperatures ranging from –°C (–°F), with the optimal range around –°C (–°F). The plants can tolerate mild frosts better than many other vegetables and withstand brief dips in temperature without severe damage. However, prolonged exposure to temperatures below °C (°F) will cause them to bolt. Plants can be grown in early spring and autumn to take advantage of the cooler weather that promotes tender, bulbous stems. In springtime, seeds and seedlings can be planted outdoors  to  weeks before the last frosts. For autumn plantings, time seed sowing or seeding transplanting so that plants mature no more than  to  weeks after the first frosts appear. In warm climates, or areas with hot summers, kohlrabi should be planted in time for an autumn harvest, during the growing period when daytime temperatures remain moderate, as plants may struggle under high heat. Kohlrabi, like other Brassicas, thrives in well-drained, fertile soil with consistent moisture and requires at least six hours of sunlight for optimal growth. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Harvest Time: Kohlrabi is ready to harvest and are at their sweetest, with a mild flavor and crunchy texture when the swollen stems reach – cm (– in) in diameter, between golf-ball and tennis-ball size, typically – weeks after sowing the seeds. If left too long, the bulbs may become tough, woody and bitter and lose their desirable flavor. Young leaves can be harvested during the growing season prepared in the same way as kale. Harvesting Tips: Storage: If kept at about °C (°F) and % humidity—conditions often limited to commercial facilities—kohlrabi bulbs can store for several months. In most home refrigerators, however, they maintain quality for around two weeks. Placing unwashed bulbs in a perforated bag (one with air holes) helps retain moisture without trapping excess condensation. During autumn, some hardier varieties can be held in a cool but frost-free space for extended periods, or left in the ground as long as temperatures remain moderate. In both cases, regularly check for splitting and plan to use kohlrabi when it’s still crisp and flavorful. Kohlrabi is a versatile vegetable that can be eaten raw in salads or as a snack. It is also great when steamed, roasted, or added to soups and stews. Its crisp texture makes it a good addition to many dishes. Overall, kohlrabi’s adaptability makes it a welcome ingredient across diverse culinary traditions. In conclusion, kohlrabi is an easy-to-grow, cool-season vegetable offering a unique flavor and remarkable versatility in the kitchen.

"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as “forever chemicals,” are a class of synthetic chemicals that have become ubiquitous in our modern world. These chemicals are characterized by their unique molecular structure, where fluorine atoms are bonded to carbon atoms, creating a highly stable chemical bond. This stability is a double-edged sword: while it imparts desirable properties such as resistance to water, oil, and heat, it also renders PFAS incredibly persistent in the environment and resistant to natural degradation processes. The reason why PFAS are a concern is because they are highly persistent in the environment and human body, leading to potential health risks such as cancer, liver damage, and immune system effects due to their bioaccumulative nature and widespread presence in everyday products​. PFAS have been used since the mid-th century (around the s) in a wide range of consumer and industrial applications. Initially discovered in the late s, PFAS were celebrated for their ability to create non-stick, water-repellent, and stain-resistant surfaces. These properties led to their use in everyday products like non-stick cookware, waterproof clothing, firefighting foams, and food packaging. The origin of PFAS can be traced back to the development of Teflon by DuPont in the s, a material that revolutionized the cookware industry due to its non-stick properties. Shortly thereafter, similar compounds, such as Scotchgard by M, were introduced for fabric protection. Over the ensuing decades, the chemical industry expanded the production of PFAS, creating thousands of variants to meet diverse industrial and consumer needs. However, the same chemical characteristics that make PFAS valuable in products also contribute to their environmental persistence. Unlike many other pollutants, PFAS do not break down in water, soil, or air, leading to their accumulation over time. This has earned them the moniker “forever chemicals,” as they remain in the environment and in living organisms long after their initial use. In recent years, the widespread presence of PFAS in the environment and their potential health impacts have garnered significant attention from scientists, policymakers, and the public. As we begin to understand the far-reaching consequences of PFAS contamination, there is a growing imperative to address the challenges posed by these persistent chemicals and to seek sustainable solutions for their management. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, encompass a diverse group of synthetic chemicals, each with unique properties and applications. They are broadly categorized based on their chemical structure, usage, and the length of their carbon-fluorine chains. Understanding the various types of PFAS is crucial for comprehending their roles in industry and their environmental persistence. PFAS are generally classified into two main categories: perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances. PFAS have been integral to many industrial and consumer applications due to their water, oil, and heat-resistant properties. Here are some of the primary uses: PFAS “forever chemicals” are found in various everyday products, and by understanding where they might be found can help consumers make informed choices to avoid them. One of the most common sources of PFAS is food packaging. Items such as microwave popcorn bags, fast food wrappers, pizza boxes, and other grease-resistant packaging often contain these chemicals. The coating that prevents oil and grease from soaking through the paper or cardboard is frequently made with PFAS. PFAS are a key component in the production of non-stick coatings, such as Teflon. These coatings are used in frying pans, baking sheets, and other cookware to provide a slick surface that prevents food from sticking. While convenient, non-stick cookware can release PFAS into the air and food, especially when overheated. PFAS are commonly used in the textile industry to create water-resistant and stain-repellent clothing. Outdoor gear, such as jackets, boots, and camping equipment, often contains PFAS to improve their durability and functionality. Certain cosmetics and personal care products, including some types of foundation, mascara, and dental floss, may contain PFAS. These chemicals can be added to improve the spreadability, durability, and water resistance of the products. By being aware of these common sources of PFAS, consumers can take steps to reduce their exposure. Choosing products with clear labeling, researching brands that prioritize safety and sustainability, and opting for natural or alternative materials can significantly decrease the presence of these harmful chemicals in everyday life. The presence of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in the environment and consumer products has raised concerns about their health effects. These chemicals are linked to adverse health outcomes due to their persistence in the human body. This section discusses human exposure routes and health effects of PFAS. Humans can be exposed to PFAS through multiple pathways, leading to their accumulation in the body over time. The primary routes of exposure include: PFAS have been linked to various health issues, with concerns about their potential carcinogenicity, effects on liver function, and impacts on the immune system. The definition of “safe” levels of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) is contentious due to their persistence and health risks. While regulatory agencies propose conservative guidelines for exposure, no universally accepted “safe” level exists, highlighting the need for ongoing research as new evidence emerges. PFAS, due to their remarkable chemical stability, have significant and far-reaching environmental impacts. Their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and widespread presence pose considerable challenges for environmental health and management. PFAS are highly persistent in the environment due to their strong carbon-fluorine bonds, among the strongest in organic chemistry. This persistence is a result of several key factors: Bioaccumulation refers to the accumulation of substances, such as PFAS, in the tissues of living organisms over time. PFAS exhibit bioaccumulation due to their chemical properties: Most people do not understand the scientific concept of a chemical’s half-life, and may assume that a period of . years or even . years is not that long. The half-life is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value. For practical purposes, a substance is often considered to have “almost disappeared” after about  half-lives, where the remaining amount is less than .% of the original. Given that the half-life of the compound is . years, we can calculate the time it takes to almost disappear as follows: Therefore, it will take approximately  years for the compound to almost disappear. PFAS contamination is a global issue, with significant environmental presence documented worldwide: The environmental impact of PFAS is profound, characterized by their persistent presence in soil, water, and air, and their ability to bioaccumulate in wildlife and humans. These chemicals, due to their resistance to natural degradation processes, pose significant challenges for environmental health. Addressing PFAS contamination requires a comprehensive understanding of their behavior in the environment and coordinated efforts to mitigate their impact on ecosystems and human health. PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are remarkably persistent chemicals that infiltrate the environment through multiple pathways beyond mere water runoff. In this section, we examine the key mechanisms by which PFAS spread—ranging from volatilization and atmospheric transport to soil leaching and bioaccumulation—highlighting the conditions that facilitate these processes and the consequent impacts on ecosystems. .. Volatilization Mechanism Definition: Volatilization is the process by which PFAS, particularly the volatile precursors or shorter-chain compounds, evaporate from a liquid or solid surface into the atmosphere. This process depends on the chemical properties of the PFAS, such as vapor pressure, and environmental conditions like temperature and wind. Conditions Required: Mechanism of Spread: .. Destination and Impact Deposition: Environmental Impact: .. Leaching Mechanism Definition: Leaching is the process by which PFAS migrate from soil into groundwater. This occurs when water percolates through contaminated soil, dissolving and carrying PFAS compounds downward into aquifers. Conditions Required: Mechanism of Spread: .. Destination and Impact Groundwater Contamination: Environmental Impact: ..

Syngoniums, also known as Arrowhead Plants, are popular houseplants appreciated for their attractive, arrow-shaped leaves and and ease of care. They can be grown in pots or used as trailing plants in hanging baskets, making them a lovely addition to any indoor space. This guide will help you care for your Syngonium plants, ensuring they thrive and flourish in your home. Description: Syngoniums are climbing plants whose leaves start out heart-shaped and develop into arrowhead shapes as they mature. The leaves can be solid green, variegated, or have shades of cream, pink, or white. As the plant grows, it produces trailing stems that can climb or hang, making it a versatile option for various indoor settings. Benefits: Syngoniums are known for their air-purifying qualities, effectively removing toxins like formaldehyde, benzene, and xylene from indoor air. Their attractive foliage and easy growth habits make them ideal for both novice and experienced plant enthusiasts. Watering Needs: Syngoniums prefer consistently moist soil but can tolerate brief periods of dryness. Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Ensure that the pot has good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can lead to root rot. During the winter months, reduce watering frequency as the plant’s growth slows. Soil and Potting: A well-draining, peat-based potting mix is ideal for Syngoniums. You can use a standard houseplant mix or create your own by combining equal parts peat moss, perlite, and potting soil. Repotting every - years is recommended to refresh the soil and provide room for growth. When repotting, be gentle with the roots to avoid damage. Light Requirements and Lux Levels: Syngoniums thrive in bright, indirect light but can adapt to various lighting conditions. Using a lux meter to measure light intensity can help determine the best location for your Syngonium, ensuring it receives the appropriate amount of light without being exposed to harsh direct sunlight. Temperature and Humidity: Syngoniums prefer warm, humid environments. They thrive in temperatures between °C to °C (°F and °F). These plants also enjoy higher humidity levels, ideally above %. To increase humidity, consider placing a humidifier nearby, misting the leaves regularly, or placing the plant on a humidity tray (pebble tray filled with water). Fertilisation and Pruning: Feed your Syngonium with a balanced, water-soluble fertiliser diluted to half strength every - weeks during the growing season (spring and summer), reducing feeding in the autumn and winter when the plant’s growth slows, or use a solid slow-release solid fertiliser that comes in pellets or prills (little round balls) in spring. Pruning is necessary to maintain the plant’s shape and encourage bushier growth. Regularly trim back leggy stems and remove any yellow or dead leaves to keep the plant looking healthy. Syngoniums can occasionally be affected by common houseplant pests such as spider mites, aphids, and mealybugs. Regularly inspect your plant and treat any infestations with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Common issues include yellowing leaves, which can indicate overwatering or poor drainage, and brown leaf tips, often a sign of low humidity or underwatering. Ensuring consistent soil moisture and maintaining high humidity can help prevent these problems. Propagating Syngoniums is a straightforward process that can help you expand your collection or share plants with friends. The best time to propagate Syngoniums is during the spring and early summer when the plant is actively growing. This guide will cover the methods for propagating Syngoniums, including stem cuttings and division, and provide detailed steps for each method. Step : Prepare Your Tools and Materials Step : Take a Cutting – Choose a healthy stem with several nodes (the points where leaves are attached) and cut a -cm (- inch) section just below a leaf node. Ensure the cutting has at least one or two nodes and several leaves. Step : Prepare the Cutting – Remove the lower leaves from the cutting, leaving a few leaves at the top. If using rooting hormone, dip the cut end of the stem into the powder to promote root growth. Step : Plant the Cutting (Soil Propagation) – Fill a small pot with fresh, well-draining potting mix. Insert the cutting into the soil, burying at least one node. Firm the soil around the base of the cutting to provide support. Step : Water and Create a Humid Environment – Water the cutting thoroughly and cover the pot with a clear plastic bag or plastic wrap to create a humid environment. This helps retain moisture and encourages rooting. Place the pot in a location with bright, indirect light. Step : Monitor and Care for the Cutting – Keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy. Check the cutting regularly for new growth, which indicates successful rooting. Once roots have developed (usually within - weeks), remove the plastic covering and continue to care for the plant as usual. Water Propagation Option: Instead of planting the cutting in soil, place the cutting in a container of water, ensuring at least one node is submerged. Place the container in bright, indirect light and change the water every few days to prevent stagnation. Once roots are .-. cm (- inches) long, transplant the cutting into a pot with fresh potting mix. Step : Prepare Your Tools and Materials Step : Water the Plant – Water the Syngonium thoroughly a day before you plan to divide it. This helps reduce stress on the plant and makes it easier to remove from the pot. Step : Remove the Plant from Its Pot – Carefully remove the Syngonium from its current pot. Gently turn the pot upside down while supporting the base of the plant with your hand, and tap the bottom to loosen the root ball. Step : Divide the Root Ball – Place the plant on a tarp or old newspaper. Examine the root ball and look for natural divisions or clumps of stems. Use your hands or a clean, sharp knife to carefully separate the plant into smaller sections. Each section should have several stems and a healthy portion of roots. Step : Repot the Divisions – Fill new pots with fresh potting mix. Place each division into its own pot, ensuring that the roots are well-covered with soil. Firmly press the soil around the base of the plant to provide support. Leave some space at the top of the pot for watering. Step : Water and Care for the New Plants – Water the newly potted divisions thoroughly to help settle the soil around the roots. Place the plants in a location with bright, indirect light and maintain high humidity levels to encourage growth. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. The best time to propagate Syngoniums is during the spring and early summer. During this period, the plant is in its active growing phase, which increases the chances of successful propagation. The warmer temperatures and longer daylight hours provide ideal conditions for root development and new growth. The conditions for newly propagated Syngoniums are similar to those of mature plants. By following these propagation methods and care tips, you can successfully propagate Syngoniums and enjoy their vibrant, lush foliage in various parts of your home or share them with friends and family. With the right conditions and care, your new Syngonium plants will thrive and bring beauty to your indoor spaces. The versatile growth habit of Syngoniums makes them excellent for various decorative purposes. They can be grown in pots on tables or shelves, or as trailing plants in hanging baskets. Their vibrant foliage can add a splash of color to any room, making them perfect for brightening up living rooms, bedrooms, and offices. Their ability to thrive in low to medium light conditions also makes them suitable for hallways and interior rooms with limited natural light. In summary, Syngoniums are a beautiful and adaptable addition to any indoor garden, offering both aesthetic appeal and air-purifying benefits. By following the care guidelines outlined in this article, you can ensure your Syngoniums thrive, bringing life and color to your indoor spaces. Whether you’re a seasoned plant enthusiast or a beginner, Syngoniums are a rewarding choice that will enhance your home or office with minimal effort.;Deep Green Permaculture
"Nitrogen (N) is a essential plant macronutrient for all plants, serving a multitude of functions that directly influence their growth and development. The nitrogen in the soil, however, doesn’t exist as a single static pool of nutrients fixed in one particular form. Instead, it undergoes continuous transformations through biological and chemical processes. One of these transformations, commonly called nitrogen drawdown—or more formally, nitrogen immobilization—can temporarily reduce the amount of nitrogen available to plants. Nitrogen drawdown occurs when carbon-rich materials (such as straw, sawdust, or wood chips) are added to the soil. Because these materials contain little nitrogen relative to their carbon content, the microorganisms that decompose them must draw extra nitrogen from the surrounding soil to build their biomass (grow their bodies and multiply)—temporarily tying up nitrogen in their own bodies that would otherwise be available to plant roots. This can lead to short-term nitrogen deficiencies in plants—manifesting as yellowing leaves (chlorosis), reduced growth, and lower crop yields—if the process is not managed properly. It should be pointed out that nitrogen drawdown occurs naturally as part of the normal cycling of organic matter when plant litter with a high carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio such as dead leaves and branches accumulates on the soil surface. While this process can be beneficial in the long run, as it increases soil organic matter, in the short-term nitrogen limitations (shortages) can be problematic in agricultural or horticultural settings if growers are unaware of this phenomenon and do not plan accordingly. This article explores the science behind nitrogen drawdown and its impact on plant growth. We will discuss nitrogen’s role in plants, detail the forms of nitrogen they can utilize, explain how nitrogen drawdown works, examine the temporary nature of nitrogen drawdown, and outline steps to manage it effectively. By understanding this critical aspect of nutrient cycling, we can optimize soil fertility and prevent unwelcome nitrogen deficiencies during the growing season. Nitrogen is the building block for amino acids, which are used to form proteins, enzymes (biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions), and structural tissues essential for plant development. It’s also a vital component of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA, which make up the plant’s genetic code and are necessary for genetic information transfer and cellular reproduction) and chlorophyll (the green plant pigment responsible for photosynthesis, allowing plants to convert sunlight into energy). Adequate nitrogen ensures strong vegetative (leaf and stem) growth, vibrant leaf color, and high photosynthetic capacity. Conversely, nitrogen-deficient plants often exhibit pale or yellowish leaves (chlorosis), reduced leaf size, and stunted overall growth. Plants take up nitrogen primarily from the soil in various mineral forms, though a few plant species can fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiosis (a beneficial mutual relationship) with certain bacteria (e.g., legumes also known as the bean and pea family, which have root nodules that house nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia bacteria that can convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form available to plants). For non-leguminous crops, the soil nitrogen supply is critical for their growth, and this can come from various inputs, such as fertilizers and organic matter. It is also depleted by various outputs, which include plant uptake, leaching into groundwater, and volatilization into the atmosphere. Within the soil, microorganisms play a central role in transforming nitrogen into the forms most readily absorbed and usable by plants. Bacteria and other soil organisms are the catalysts of nitrogen transformations, driving both the breakdown (mineralization) of organic nitrogen and the temporary retention (immobilization) of available nitrogen. When growers or gardeners add amendments or residues (plant materials) to the soil, the microbial community responds, often flourishing in the presence of new carbon sources. Whether that increased microbial activity benefits or hinders plant growth depends on the C:N ratio of those inputs and how they shift the balance between mineralization and immobilization of nitrogen. For plants to absorb nitrogen directly, it typically must be in the form of ammonium (NH+) or nitrate (NO–). These are the primary mineral forms of nitrogen in agricultural soils, and are collectively referred to as mineral nitrogen. Ammonium often binds to clay particles and soil organic matter due to its positive charge (known as the soil CEC or cation exchange capacity), making it relatively immobile (bound up) in the soil profile. Nitrate, on the other hand, is negatively charged and being highly soluble (able to dissolve in water), easily moves with water through the soil, increasing potential for leaching and groundwater contamination if not managed properly. In the natural nitrogen cycle, nitrogen is transformed into a series of different forms, through various processes. The key paths of nitrogen transformation include: Plant-available nitrogen is always in a dynamic (changing) state. As microbes consume or release nitrogen, the balance between availability (mineralization and immobilization) shifts. Nitrogen drawdown specifically refers to the period when microbial consumption (uptake) of nitrogen is greater than the release of nitrogen, significantly limiting the nitrogen supply available to plants. The carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio is a measure of the the proportion of carbon to nitrogen in a given organic residue (animal or plant material). For example, a C:N ratio of : indicates there are  units of carbon for every unit of nitrogen. This is a useful indicator of how quickly or slowly the material will break down and how it will affect soil nitrogen availability—whether nitrogen will be immobilized (made temporarily unavailable to plants) or mineralized (released into a plant-available form) when the material is added to soil.. Low C:N ratio materials, such as green grass clippings or animal manure (with a C:N ratio usually less than :), tend to release nitrogen as they decomposes because they contain relatively higher nitrogen levels, and more nitrogen than microbes need to break down the carbon. (Microbes need around : to : which is why that’s the the ideal C:N composting ratio). These materials are less likely to cause nitrogen immobilization and actually release nitrogen into the soil as they break down, providing a direct benefit to plant growth. High C:N ratio materials, such as sawdust or straw (with a C:N ratio typically greater than :), are rich in carbon but relative to nitrogen, and are therefore considered low in nitrogen. When these materials are incorporated (dug) into the soil, microorganisms decompose them using carbon as an energy source but also require nitrogen for cellular growth. If the material lacks sufficient nitrogen, the soil microorganisms must scavenge additional nitrogen from the surrounding soil, temporarily reducing the nitrogen available for plant uptake. If the soil does not contain enough readily available nitrogen to supply both the plants and microbes, the microbes will draw down the reserve of plant-available nitrogen, diverting it away from roots in the short term, temporarily tying up nitrogen that would otherwise be available to plants. This phenomenon, known as nitrogen drawdown or immobilization, can leave plants with a diminished supply of nitrogen until the decomposition process progresses and begins releasing nitrogen back into the soil. An example of the C:N ratios of some high-carbon materials are: By comparison, materials high in nitrogen such as manures usually have lower C:N ratios (often in the : to : range), although this can vary widely depending on the animal species and their diet. In general, amendments with lower C:N ratios are less prone to causing nitrogen drawdown because microbes have ample nitrogen to meet their metabolic needs without depleting soil reserves extensively. For more information see this list of carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio of organic materials used for composting. Nitrogen drawdown, or immobilization, occurs primarily due to the activity of a vast array of soil microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes. These microorganisms require carbon for energy and nitrogen for protein synthesis. When a fresh carbon source enters the soil (for example, sawdust is mixed into a garden bed), microbial populations grow and flourish to take advantage of this new food supply. However, if the carbon is much more abundant than nitrogen in the decomposing material (As it is in sawdust with a C:N ratio typically around :), the microbes must source the needed nitrogen from elsewhere—namely the soil’s pool of mineral nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), as explained previously. As these carbon-rich materials undergo microbial decomposition, the nitrogen drawdown process can be broken down into several key stages, outlined below. The magnitude and duration of nitrogen drawdown depend on factors such as residue (plant and animal materials) composition, soil texture (sandy, clay or loam soil), existing soil organic matter, temperature, and moisture. Warmer, moist conditions speed microbial activity and decomposition of organic matter, increasing the rate of both immobilization and subsequent mineralization, whereas cooler or drier conditions slow these processes. One key aspect of nitrogen drawdown is that it is a temporary phenomenon. Initially, soil microbes rapidly consume available nitrogen, leading to deficiencies for plants. However, this phase does not last indefinitely. As decomposition proceeds, both the carbon and nitrogen in the organic material eventually become stabilized in humus or mineralized back into inorganic forms. The net impact on soil fertility may actually be positive in the long run if the inputs help to build soil organic matter. Why Nitrogen Drawdown Tends to be Short-Lived In practice, many farmers and gardeners who work with carbon-rich mulches or soil amendments notice that the most pronounced nitrogen drawdown occurs in the initial weeks or months after incorporation (Mixing into the soil). With proper management, the soil typically recovers as the decomposition progresses. Short-term nitrogen deficiency can have an immediate and often visible impact on plant growth. When the soil solution is drained of plant-available nitrogen, plants must compete with the growing microbial population for the limited supply. Common symptoms of insufficient nitrogen in plants include: From an ecological systems perspective, nitrogen drawdown which binds up the nitrogen macronutrient can be strategically beneficial if it helps retain nutrients in the long term by reducing leaching losses where water soluble nitrogen is washed away. Microbially held nitrogen eventually becomes available to plants as microbial cells die and decompose, providing a slow-release effect that stabilizes soil fertility over time. However, growers must navigate the short-term consequences to avoid production losses. Managing nitrogen drawdown requires a balanced approach that meets both the immediate needs of crops and the long-term goal of improving soil health. By planning ahead and adopting the strategies below, growers can lessen the risk of severe nitrogen immobilization while benefiting from organic additions to the soil. Key strategies for managing nitrogen drawdown include: By combining these strategies, growers can maintain adequate plant-available nitrogen levels during critical growth stages while still obtaining the benefits of adding organic matter to the soil. In conclusion, while nitrogen drawdown can pose short-term challenges, it also underscores the interconnected ecological nature of soil health. Microbes are not merely competitors for nutrients; they are also partners in building healthy soil environments, improving soil structure, water-holding capacity, and fertility as they decompose organic matter, form soil aggregates, and cycle nutrients. Nitrogen drawdown is a natural part of the soil nitrogen cycle, driven by soil organisms breaking down high-carbon material to return their nutrients back into the soil. Although nitrogen drawdown can temporarily deprive plants of essential nitrogen during critical growth stages, by paying close attention to the C:N ratio, timing when plant and animal residues are incorporated into the soil, and providing supplemental nitrogen as needed, growers can mitigate nitrogen nutrient shortages. By balancing immediate plant needs with longer-term soil health, growers can benefit from enhanced soil organic matter and robust microbial activity while maintaining optimal fertility for productive, resilient crops.";Deep Green Permaculture
Chives are herbaceous perennials grown for their slender, hollow green leaves which are used as culinary herbs with a mild onion flavor. They typically grow in dense clumps, reaching around - cm (- in) in height. The leaves are cylindrical, soft in texture and taper to a point. As members of the onion family, chives are closely related to garlic, onions and shallots, and develop small bulbs at their roots. The chive plants produce flower stalks with spherical clusters of pale purple/lavender blossoms around – cm (about /–¼ in) across, consisting of – individual star-shaped inflorescences (flowers), each under cm (/ in) in size with  tepals (petals). These flowers are edible, and can be used in salads and flower arrangements. Once chive flowers fully mature, they produce small, shiny black triangular seeds (about – mm long) inside papery seed pods. As the flower heads fade and dry, these pods split open, exposing the lightweight seeds, which are easily scattered with the slightest disturbance, such as movement from the wind or harvesting. Chives are perennial, and may live for many years under favorable conditions. They die back to the ground over winter in colder climates but reemerge in spring. They are commonly grown in herb gardens, containers, or as ornamental border plants due to their compact growth habit, bright foliage, and decorative blooms. Chives (Allium schoenoprasum) and garlic chives (Allium tuberosum) share a similar appearance and can both be used fresh or dried as a culinary herb, but differ in their flavor, leaf shape, and flowering time. Chives are a hardy perennial herb that prefer mild climates, typically growing best in temperatures between –°C (–°F). They can withstand light frosts and may begin growing early in spring once soil temperatures reach around °C (°F). Chives thrive under full sun but will tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter regions. In colder climates, plants may die back to the ground in winter and reemerge when conditions warm. Overly hot climates may slow their growth or cause them to go dormant during peak summer heat. Start seeds indoors – weeks before the last frost. Seeds will take - days to germinate under warm conditions around –°C (–°F). Transplant outdoors once the threat of frosts has passed, when seedlings are about  weeks old and after they have been hardened off in a protected location outdoors to acclimatize. Chives prefer well-drained, fertile soil and regular moisture. New plants can also be produced by dividing established plants in springtime. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Divide established chive plants in early spring, when new growth begins but before they reach their peak size. They can also be divided in autumn when the weather is fairly mild. Chives rank among the most versatile culinary herbs, offering a bright, onion-like flavor that enhances a variety of dishes without overpowering more delicate flavors. Chives are most flavorful when fresh. Additionally, unlike onions, chives rarely make your eyes water when chopped. Their lower sulfur content also makes them more compatible with other herbs and spices. Below are several popular ways to use chives in everyday cooking: Cooking Tip: Add chives toward the end of cooking to preserve their delicate flavor and bright green hue. Preserving: Freezing chopped chives in water-filled ice cube trays helps preserve excess harvests for year-round use. This method retains much of their fresh flavor. In conclusion, chives are a low-maintenance, attractive addition to any herb garden, offering fresh, onion-like leaves season after season. With simple care and occasional division to keep plants healthy, chives reward gardeners with attractive flowers and a steady harvest of flavorful leaves that can be used in countless recipes.;Deep Green Permaculture
"The Scoville scale is the gold standard for measuring chili pepper heat, offering a way to quantify the spiciness of peppers, from the mild bell pepper to the record-breaking Carolina Reaper. Understanding this scale enhances culinary exploration by allowing spice enthusiasts to better gauge their heat tolerance and make informed choices when selecting peppers that suit their taste and cooking needs. The Scoville scale categorizes chili peppers by their heat levels, spanning a spectrum from mild varieties to some of the world’s hottest. Below is a detailed list of chili peppers, including both popular and uncommon varieties, organized by their Scoville Heat Units (SHU). Description: These chilies provide a subtle, almost sweet heat or no heat at all. Perfect for adding flavor without overwhelming spice, they are commonly used in salads, pickling, and mild sauces. Examples include bell peppers and banana peppers. Chili Pepper Name and Scoville Heat Units (SHU) rating Description: These chilies bring a gentle warmth, making them ideal for salsas, mild curries, and roasted dishes. They offer a step up in heat while remaining accessible to most palates. Examples include Anaheim peppers and jalapeños. Chili Pepper Name and Scoville Heat Units (SHU) rating Description: These peppers deliver a noticeable kick of heat without overwhelming the senses. They are commonly used in spicier salsas, hot sauces, and stir-fries. Examples include serrano peppers and cayenne. Chili Pepper Name and Scoville Heat Units (SHU) rating Description: These chilies pack significant heat and are suited for dishes requiring bold spice. They are often used in hot sauces and spicy marinades. Examples include habanero and Scotch bonnet peppers. Chili Pepper Name and Scoville Heat Units (SHU) rating Chili Pepper Name and Scoville Heat Units (SHU) rating Description: These chilies deliver an intense and fiery heat that goes beyond what most people can comfortably handle. They are commonly used in extra-hot sauces, spicy condiments, and dishes that cater to true heat enthusiasts. These peppers are a step below the superhots but still pack a serious punch. Examples include Red Savina Habanero and Chocolate Habanero. Description: These are some of the world’s hottest peppers, delivering intense heat that can overwhelm unprepared palates. Often used sparingly in extreme hot sauces or for culinary challenges. Examples include Carolina Reaper and Trinidad Moruga Scorpion. Chili Pepper Name and Scoville Heat Units (SHU) rating First introduced in  by American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville, the Scoville scale has become the benchmark for evaluating the heat of chili peppers. Originally created to quantify the pungency of peppers, which were gaining popularity for medicinal and culinary use, the scale assigns Scoville Heat Units (SHU) based on the concentration of capsaicinoids—the compounds responsible for chili peppers’ fiery heat. Scoville’s method, known as the Organoleptic Test, was a relatively simple but subjective method that involved creating an alcohol extract of the dried chili pepper, which was then diluted in a solution of sugar water. This diluted solution was given to a panel of five trained testers, who would sip the mixture and report whether they could detect any heat. The solution was repeatedly diluted until at least three out of the five testers could no longer perceive any heat. The degree of dilution required to reach this point determined the Scoville Heat Units (SHU) of the pepper. For example, if a pepper’s extract had to be diluted , times before the heat was no longer detectable, the pepper would be assigned a Scoville rating of , SHU. While groundbreaking for its time, the test was subjective and influenced by individual tolerance levels. Modern advancements, such as High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), have replaced this method, offering precise and reproducible measurements by directly quantifying capsaicinoids. These results are converted into SHU, ensuring consistency and accuracy in food production and research. The Scoville scale is more than a measure of heat; it’s an essential tool for chefs, food enthusiasts, and industries alike. It helps in selecting peppers for culinary purposes, ensuring consistent spice levels in recipes, and even standardizing capsaicin-based pharmaceutical products. Capsaicin (chemical formula, C₁₈H₂₇NO₃) is the compound responsible for the heat of chili peppers, and belongs to a class of alkaloids called capsaicinoids, which are unique to the Capsicum genus. It’s a hydrophobic, colorless crystalline or waxy solid that’s insoluble in water but dissolves effectively in oils, alcohols, and other organic solvents, making these substances ideal for extracting or diluting its heat. The sensation of heat produced by capsaicin is due to its interaction with the TRPV (transient receptor potential vanilloid ) receptors in the human body. These receptors, commonly referred to as “heat receptors,” are specialized proteins that detect physical heat, acidic conditions, and certain chemical stimuli. When capsaicin binds to these receptors, it triggers a sensation of burning pain by mimicking the effect of actual heat or injury—despite causing no physical damage. This mechanism explains the intense burning sensation in the mouth when consuming chili peppers. From an evolutionary perspective, capsaicin serves as a critical defense mechanism for chili plants. Its primary role is to deter herbivores, particularly mammals, from consuming the chili fruits, as the mammalian digestive system destroys the seeds. Mammals experience the intense burning caused by capsaicin and tend to avoid the peppers after an initial encounter. By contrast, birds are unaffected by capsaicin due to the absence of functional TRPV receptors. This difference in sensitivity benefits chili plants, as chili seeds survive their journey through a bird’s digestive system, so birds can consume and disperse seeds intact over large distances, aiding in the plant’s propagation and spread. In addition to deterring herbivores, capsaicin plays a protective role against microbial and fungal pathogens. Its antimicrobial properties help safeguard the fruit from decay and disease, ensuring the seeds remain viable for germination. This dual function—deterring mammals while protecting against pathogens—underscores the evolutionary significance of capsaicin in the survival and reproductive success of chili plants. Capsaicin has also been extensively studied for its analgesic (pain relief) properties, and is used in topical creams and patches designed to relieve pain from conditions such as arthritis, neuropathy, and muscle strains. These products typically contain capsaicin concentrations that correlate with a specific level on the Scoville scale, indicating the potential efficacy of the treatment. Capsaicin works by interacting once again with the TRPV receptors in the skin, the same receptors responsible for sensing heat and pain. When applied topically, capsaicin initially causes a burning sensation, followed by a reduction in pain intensity as the nerve cells become desensitized. This desensitization occurs because capsaicin depletes the neurotransmitter substance P, which is responsible for transmitting pain signals to the brain. In summary, the Scoville scale provides a clear way to navigate and choose from the wide range of chili peppers, from mild and flavorful to intensely hot. Chili peppers not only enhance dishes with their heat and flavor but also play important roles in medicine and science through the unique properties of capsaicin. Understanding their heat levels allows us to fully appreciate their versatility and value.";Deep Green Permaculture

The naming of cucurbits, such as squash and pumpkins, varies significantly across regions, often leading to confusion. While these terms describe the same plants botanically, regional preferences and cultural traditions influence how they are named and categorized. In North America, the term squash is broadly used to refer to members of the Cucurbita genus, which includes both summer and winter varieties. The term pumpkin is generally reserved for specific types of hard-skinned winter squash that are round, orange, and commonly used for carving or cooking, although it can sometimes overlap with squash. In Australia and New Zealand, the naming conventions differ from North America: This distinction reflects a more narrow usage of the term squash in these regions compared to the broader application seen in North America. In the UK and much of Europe, naming conventions blend aspects of North American and Australian traditions. While the terms squash and pumpkin are used differently around the world, they all refer to plants in the same botanical family. The key distinctions lie in regional naming conventions and cultural preferences. Understanding these differences can help clarify conversations about these versatile and widely grown crops.;Deep Green Permaculture
Pumpkin plants, like all cucurbits, require pollination for fruit development. These plants produce separate male and female flowers, with the female flowers being responsible for forming the pumpkins. While bees and other pollinators naturally carry out this process, hand-pollination can be an effective technique to ensure a pumpkin grows, particularly when pollinator activity is low or if you want to control which flowers are pollinated for specific breeding or growing goals. This detailed guide will walk you through the process of hand-pollinating pumpkin plants for successful fruit production. Pumpkin plants have two types of flowers: male and female. Identifying and understanding their differences is crucial for successful hand-pollination: Bees and other pollinators are usually very efficient at facilitating pollinating flowers, but there are circumstances where hand-pollination becomes beneficial or necessary. Ensuring fruit set in unfavorable conditions: During rainy, windy, or excessively hot weather, pollinators may be less active, and this reduced pollinator activity may leave flowers under-pollinated, which can result in poor fruit set, particularly early in the growing season. Maximizing yield: Hand-pollination is also a useful technique to increase fruit set (the process of flowers developing into fruit). This method is especially beneficial for the first female flowers of the season, as manually pollinating them can produce fruit earlier and increase overall yields. Providing control over the pollination process: Additionally, hand pollination allows for controlled pollination, in order to influence certain fruit characteristics through a process known as metaxenia. This phenomenon refers to the impact of the pollen donor on the development and quality of the fruit produced. By selecting pollen from a plant with desirable traits—such as larger fruit size, better sugar content, or improved color—you can enhance specific attributes of the resulting fruit. This approach is particularly valuable when growing specific varieties, optimizing fruit quality for consumption or sale and also for ensuring genetic consistency for seed collection to prevent hybridization (cross-breeding) with other varieties. When preparing hand pollinate flowers, timing is critical. Pumpkin flowers open early in the morning and close by mid-afternoon. Pollination should occur during this window for the best results. Also use fresh flowers when hand pollinating. Male flowers begin producing pollen as soon as they open. Use them the same day for optimal effectiveness. It’s important to avoid damaging the flowers when hand pollinating. Handle the flowers gently to avoid damaging the delicate reproductive structures. Also, if pests or bad weather threaten the flowers, cover the pollinated female flower with a light cloth or mesh netting to protect it while it sets fruit. Follow these steps to hand-pollinate your pumpkin plants effectively: After successful pollination, monitor fruit development. The swollen ovary at the base of the female flower will begin to grow into a pumpkin. If pollination fails, the flower and ovary will wither and drop off. If hand-pollination does not result in fruit development, consider these factors: Addressing these issues can improve the chances of successful fruit development after hand-pollination. Hand-pollination is a valuable technique that can also be used for many other cucurbit plants, including zucchini, cucumbers, melons, winter squash, and gourds. These crops share similar flowering structures and habits as pumpkins, making the process straightforward across the family. Below are specific considerations for each type of cucurbit: By tailoring hand-pollination techniques to the specific needs of each cucurbit crop, gardeners can ensure healthy fruit development and improve overall yields. In summary, hand-pollination is a highly effective method for ensuring fruit development across most cucurbits, especially in situations where natural pollination may be inadequate. While the general technique remains similar to that used for pumpkins, adjustments are needed based on flower size, timing, or variety characteristics like parthenocarpy. With careful observation and a little effort and experimentation in hand pollination, gardeners can maximize yields with their cucurbit crops.;Deep Green Permaculture
Pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo and related species such as Cucurbita mixta, Cucurbita maxima, and Cucurbita moschata) are annual plants known for their sprawling growth habit, with vines that can extend . –  meters ( - feet) in length. The plant typically grows to a height of around  –  cm ( –  inches) above the ground from the base to the top of the leaves. The stems are angular, hairy, and often ribbed, providing structural support for the large, lobed leaves that are dark green with a rough texture. These leaves can reach sizes of  –  cm ( –  inches) across and are deeply lobed with serrated edges. Pumpkin plants produce large, funnel-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The flowers are monoecious, meaning both male and female flowers are produced on the same plant. The male flowers are produced on long peduncles (stalks that support the flower, elevating it above the vine) and appear first, while the female flowers develop closer to the vine and are distinguishable by the small ovary (round swollen section) at the base, which eventually develops into the pumpkin fruit after pollination. The fruit, commonly known as a pumpkin, is technically a pepo, a type of berry with a thick rind. The skin of the pumpkin is often ribbed, and usually orange in color, although there are also yellow, red, green and white varieties. The pumpkin fruit can range greatly in size, shape and color. Miniature pumpkins can weigh around .kg ( lb), and large pumpkins, such as those used for carving or display, typically weigh around  –  kg ( –  lbs). Giant pumpkins which can reach over  kg ( lbs). Certain varieties, such as the ‘Atlantic Giant’, which are cultivated specifically to achieve much greater weights, for competitions and exhibitions, and often exceeding  kg (, lbs). Inside, the pumpkin is filled with seeds and fibrous strands, with the seeds being encased in a white shell. The seeds can be roasted and eaten. Pumpkins are highly versatile, valued not only for their culinary uses in pies, soups, and other dishes but also for their cultural significance during autumnal celebrations like Halloween and Thanksgiving. Pumpkins are a warm-season crop that thrives in warm climates, and are highly sensitive to frost. The optimal temperature for growth is between -°C (-°F), and temperatures above °C (°F) or below °C (°F) slow the growth and maturity of the crop. They require a frost-free growing period of around  to  months. Seeds germinate best when soil temperatures are at least °C (°F), and seedlings emerge faster at higher temperatures. Seeds should germinate in around  to  days. Seeds may be sown in containers and the seedlings can be transplanted into the garden when they are  cm high after the last frost, when soil temperatures have warmed up sufficiently. Pumpkins can be grown in almost any fertile, well-drained soil with a neutral or slight acidic pH. They require relatively little water and are drought-tolerant, but are sensitive to waterlogging. Note: Check gardening calendars for the best planting times in your location Pruning pumpkin plants is a valuable technique to direct the plant’s energy into producing healthier vines and larger, higher-quality fruits. By managing vine growth strategically, you can optimize the plant’s resources and create ideal growing conditions for your pumpkins. Here’s how to prune effectively: By following these pruning tips, you can effectively manage your pumpkin plant, improve its overall health, and achieve a bountiful harvest of high-quality pumpkins. Regular observation and maintenance will ensure your efforts result in strong, productive vines and vibrant, healthy fruit. Pumpkin plants initially produce male flowers for  to  weeks before female flowers appear. This is a normal growth pattern that can vary depending on the cultivar. For fruit to develop, pollen from male flowers must be transferred by bees to female flowers, which can be identified by the small fruit located beneath the flower. Poor fruit set often occurs during rainy weather because bees are less active. To support pollination, avoid using pesticides during the blooming period to protect pollinators. For information on hand pollination of pumpkins, see the article – How to Hand-Pollinate Pumpkin Plants: A Step-by-Step Guide Pumpkins are ready to harvest when they reach a deep, solid color (orange for most varieties) and the rind is hard. The vines should also be dying back. One simple rule is that pumpkins are ready to harvest when they reach full color and the stem is dry and hard. Harvest typically occurs - weeks after planting from seed, usually around mid-autumn, before heavy frosts. If vines die prematurely due to disease or other factors, harvest the mature pumpkins and store them appropriately. Harvesting Tips: To harvest, use a sharp knife or pruning shears to cut pumpkins from the vines, leaving . to  cm ( to  inches) of stem attached. This helps prevent decay by fruit rot pathogens at the stem attachment and extends storage life. It also makes the fruit look more attractive. Don’t try carrying pumpkins by their stems as the fruit are very heavy and may get damaged. Avoid snapping stems, as pumpkins without stems generally do not store well. To prevent injury from sharp prickles on the stems of some varieties, wear gloves while harvesting. Curing Pumpkins: For pumpkins that will be stored, cure them by placing them in the sun for about a week. Commercially, pumpkin fruits are cured at -°C (-°F) and -% relative humidity for  days. This helps harden the rind (skin), heal any wounds, and improves storage longevity. Handle pumpkins gently to avoid cutting or bruising, as damaged or immature pumpkins do not store well. While light frost will not harm the skin or flesh, temperatures below -°C (°F) can damage the fruit. Store pumpkins in a cool, dry area with temperatures between  and °C ( and °F) and a relative humidity of -%. These conditions provide optimal preservation, allowing pumpkins to be stored for - months. Commercially, pumpkins may be sanitized before storage to reduce the chance of rot and spoilage. Proper storage conditions help prevent decay and extend the pumpkins’ shelf life, ensuring they remain fresh for display or consumption. Avoid storing pumpkins in damp or cold environments, as these conditions can lead to spoilage. Pumpkins are one of the most versatile ingredients in the kitchen, valued for their mild, slightly sweet flavor and nutrient-rich composition. They can be prepared in numerous ways to suit savory and sweet dishes alike. Whether roasted, baked, or pureed, pumpkin’s culinary versatility makes it an essential ingredient in kitchens worldwide. Its seeds, flowers, and even leaves can also be used to minimize waste and maximize nutrition. In conclusion, growing pumpkins can be a fun and rewarding endeavor, especially for those looking to engage in fall festivities or simply grow their own nutritious food. With proper care and attention, pumpkins can thrive and produce impressive yields that are both delicious and decorative.;Deep Green Permaculture
"This is a bittersweet farewell and celebration as we say hoo-roo to the Permaculture Principles calendar after  years.  years! That’s  months of appreciation for permaculture projects around the world, and nearly  days of permaculture having pride of place on walls everywhere. We’ve contributed over $,AU to support permaculture projects and change makers too – something we’re proud to reflect upon. As anyone with a wall calendar will attest, those little daily boxes become the custodians of all kinds of precious information; plantings, gatherings, rainfall, heatwaves, loved one’s birthdays, moods, homesteading to-dos and the occasional absentminded work of art. It has been a joy to create each calendar knowing that thousands of people are sharing the same daily experience, noticing and capturing the small, vital stuff of life. And long after each calendar “expires”, it lives on as a treasured time capsule; a ledger of all your legendary permaculture antics – we know that many of these calendars will be in use for years to come. There are still two months to enjoy, but we do realise that many people are getting organised and looking for a calendar to take them into . It won’t be ours, we are sorry to say… but hey, it has been wonderful! Massive thanks to the Permaculture Calendar team who have brought it all together, including the original designers David Arnold and Richard Telford. To Oliver Holmgren, Christine Cahusac, Grace and Felix as well as Emma O’Dell, we are so grateful for your tireless work. Printing in Australia on ethically sourced paper has been supplied from Print Together, Moule Print, Focus Print Group and Printgraphics. A very special thanks to all of the wonderful calendar contributors who furnished each month with permie inspiration.

"In the hills east of Canberra, down a dusty lane that passes racehorses dozing in thick phalaris, and wild apple trees and thickets of plum and hawthorn, then winds up the Lake George escarpment through Yellow Box woodland full of finches, thornbills, cuckoo-shrikes, kookaburras and robins, there’s a rusty old gate with a stencilled sign that says “Millpost”. The heritage of our farm is long, complex and rich; challenging to protect in a time of climatic and economic uncertainty. As custodians for thirty-nine years, our family has endeavoured to preserve and enrich this landscape, while earning enough from the land to enjoy the privilege of maintaining stewardship. Permaculture Principle #: Obtain a Yield In January  David and I attended the first-ever PDC at Stanley, Tasmania with Bill Mollison. The insights we gained have guided our decision-making ever since. Minimising food miles, creating stability through diversity, turning problems into assets, zero waste, small-scale and local solutions…these have been our bywords. Millpost was windswept and degraded when David first arrived in . Since then, we’ve planted or direct-seeded approximately  kilometres of native windbreaks using Eucalyptus, Acacia, Bursaria, Callistemon and Casuarinas. Sheep are excluded from about  hectares, including riparian zones, to allow natural regeneration. Stock and wildlife alike benefit from shade and shelter in every paddock. Big increases in bird populations ( sp.) mean improved natural pest control. But it’s not all good news; the resulting increase in kangaroo numbers threatens our viability. Deciduous trees such as poplar, willow, oak, ash, honey locust and black locust are planted strategically to provide fire protection for the homestead complex, as well as stock fodder, shade and food (fruit and nuts). If they sucker, all the better! Both native and exotic trees are harvested for timber (building and fence posts) and firewood (heating and cooking). By harvesting water from shed roofs uphill from dwellings, we use the Permaculture strategy of storing water at the highest possible point and using gravity to move it, rather than relying on pumps. We also place dams as high as possible in the landscape to enable gravity-feeding of water for stock or gardens. Principle #:Catch and Store Energy. David Holmgren created a Whole Farm Plan for us in . We are gradually implementing the design, moving from  large paddocks back in the s to about  today, which we subdivide further with portable electric fencing. The new paddocks allow us to spell over % of the farm at any one time and to keep the sheep out of wet areas when necessary. Our main challenge has been making a living from a relatively infertile farm, especially in frequent severe droughts. Our Permaculture system allowed us to survive low wool prices and other adversities because producing our own food (vegies, fruit, meat, eggs and dairy produce) has lowered our cost of living. Today’s challenge is to provide a livelihood here for our children and their families. We hope our diversification venture, Millpost Merino knitting yarn, will help our family farm survive. Principle #: Integrate Rather than Segregate Our native pastures (more than % of the farm) are botanically diverse and yield well even in drought. Principle #: Use and Value Diversity Bill Mollison told us the difference between conventional farmers and Permaculturists was that the former looked at the land and asked: how can this land be made to produce dollars? Whereas the latter asked: what does it (nature) offer? Principle #: Observe and Interact Merino wool is the finest, softest wool in the world as a result of centuries of careful breeding programmes. Merino sheep can withstand climatic extremes and still produce this robust yet soft, multi-functional fibre for making clothing that can last a lifetime. We are taking the Stewardship approach to our wool enterprise, by protecting and enhancing the endangered temperate native grasslands (including Grassy Yellow Box Woodlands) that make up much of the  hectares of Millpost farm. Sheep are a regenerative tool: they graze pasture hard for short periods then move on to a fresh paddock, allowing grasslands enough time to recover between grazing events. Depending on seasonal conditions, paddocks may be grazed briefly only two or three times per year. We are starting small, with only the very best of our fine wool clip (three bales) being processed for yarn.

 I discovered the magic of gardening at an early age, looking after Dad’s herbs at home. As a keen cook, he kept quite a collection. There must have been thirty different varieties with each one growing in an individual terracotta pot, neatly lined up in rows on a tiered planter shelf. It was my job to keep them in top shape. Hand watering was a daily task in Perth’s hot, dry summer. Regular feeding to keep the growth soft and palatable, and occasional re-potting, division and replanting – all simple tasks that made a big impact on me. These were the first things that I nurtured and the result of these efforts ended up in our dinner most evenings. My next garden project was a bit more ambitious. At fourteen I set up a four-square-metre ‘no-dig’ vegie patch on top of the lawn in our backyard. I was fascinated by how a few bales of straw, a load of compost and a handful of seeds could be converted into bundles of fresh vegetables within a matter of months. I often tell people that growing food is highly infectious. Once you make a start the sense of satisfaction and reward is overwhelming. I can still vividly recall the moment when it really hit me. It was late one warm afternoon and I had been working in my little patch, which by this stage had expanded to include a number of large tubs filled with tomatoes and climbing beans trailing along the fence. I sat on the lawn, leaning back against the warm red brick wall of our shed and basked in the contentment and satisfaction with what I had created. From that point on I’ve considered myself a gardener. Dad picked up on my new fascination with gardening. As a keen book collector he was thrilled to see me fossicking in second hand book shops as I slowly developed a collection of my own. One evening he gave me two books that he had bought years before and tucked away in a forgotten section of his library. They were first edition copies of Permaculture One and Permaculture Two. They made immediate sense to me. The ideas were logical, the principles were practical and the ethical basis underpinning it all was fair and just. The more I read, the more I started to question things, especially life in a comfortable suburb, living in high energy, wasteful homes, surrounded by high maintenance unproductive landscapes. It was all wrong. Clearly there must be a better way to do it. I realised that I needed to learn more about the natural world and the way that it worked. This realisation influenced my subject selection in high school and eventually led me to study environmental science at university, but it was always the practical aspects of permaculture that kept me inspired. My interest in permaculture got a major boost at the age of nineteen when I stumbled across a neglected suburban block with potential. It was a classic run down rental property that still retained the features typical to the original s homes in the area. There were old fruit trees, a hen shed, a dilapidated glass house and a workshop. There were remnant native species that, given their age, would have pre-dated the development of the area. It was like a time capsule. All around it, time had moved on. Dalkeith was now a prestigious riverside address noted for its leafy gardens and proximity to private schools. Meanwhile number  Circe Circle was still like something out of the BBC classic The Good Life. My brother was renting the place with his mates. The first time I visited I thought to myself, “I’ve got to get this place!” Timing was on my side and it wasn’t long before he moved out and I moved in. And so began my first serious garden project. Being my first rental property, I wasn’t exactly sure of what the rules were when it came to working in the garden. The place was a complete mess so I assumed that any work tidying up was bound to be appreciated. I started off tentatively. I was busy studying at university and was also running a part-time local gardening round, so my early efforts were mainly limited to exploring the various nooks and crannies of the block. Each session was like an archaeological dig. The more things I’d discovered including old tools and forgotten pathways, the more intrigued I became with the garden. It wasn’t long before I decided the best thing to do was to drop down to part-time study and take this project more seriously. Whether it was my growing passion for gardening or an avoidance strategy for chemistry and statistics is beside the point – it was the best thing I ever did. Over the next six years, my housemates and I rejuvenated the property and created a remarkable garden that combined friendship, learning, fun with a real feeling of independence and self-reliance. We pulled the lawn up, repaired the glasshouse, repaired the sheds, installed a rainwater tank and set up trellises for growing fruit trees and vines. We built new pens for ducks and aviaries for pigeons and quail. We experimented with solar ovens and composting toilets, brewed beer and baked bread. It was brilliant. Being poor students we learnt how to be resourceful with salvaged materials and created a space with rambling pathways, extended poultry runs, homemade garden seats, worm farms and compost bays. We basically overhauled the place and it wasn’t long until I actually felt as if the property was ours. What we did buy, we bought locally. There was a small group of shops around the corner called the ‘Dalkeith Village’ which had been there (in more humble form) since the suburb began in the s. There was a bakery, a little supermarket, a bottle shop, a nursery and even a small father-son owned hardware store where you could still buy individual nails. Of course they charged like a wounded bull, earning the proprietor the nickname ‘Old Man Fleece’ amongst my housemates, but that didn’t really matter. It was more important for us to know that we were supporting local businesses, which provided the convenience, comfort and security that we had what we needed near by. In time we struck up great relationships with our elderly neighbours. Most had been there for some forty plus years and remembered a time when everyone had fruit trees and chooks in their backyard. I’m sure that they thought we were odd to start with, but when they realised we were really having a go, their interest grew. It wasn’t long before I was passing eggs and homegrown produce over the fence. In return they would make jams, give tips on the best local plant varieties and dear old Mrs James up the back would throw her scraps over for our chooks. There was a real sense of community. My friends were also fascinated. When people visited they’d head straight for the chooks. At night I’d give tours by torchlight to explore the jungle like garden and spot frogs. Being born in the mid s, we were part of a generation that didn’t automatically connect with gardening and self-reliance. Perhaps that was part of the buzz for me, in that we were doing something different – something inherently practical and something that just made sense. In , the th International Permaculture Conference (IPC) was to be held in Perth, and with it a special Permaculture Design Course (PDC) was to be run involving a number of respected WA permaculturists as guest teachers. I’d been planning to do my PDC for a while, but as a student, time and cost were always an issue. Attending IPC was an opportunity too good to miss. I deferred from university for a semester, cranked up the gardening round to save up some money and registered for the design course and conference. By this stage, I was confident with many of the practical aspects of permaculture from the hands-on skills that I had developed in my backyard and on my gardening round, but I was eager to explore new concepts in design and relate them to my academic studies. The PDC, conference and site tours that followed certainly provided this and made me realise that it was time to leave the comfort of my backyard and neighbourhood and expand my skill set by working on other projects. As always an opportunity soon presented itself. One of the site tours we took during the PDC was to the Environmental Technology Centre at Murdoch University (the university where I was studying). It was a fascinating project which had been set up as a research and development facility to explore the applications of small-scale environmental technologies in the areas of water supply, sanitation, energy, shelter, and food production. The research group’s main focus at the time was the application of appropriate technologies for improved environmental health in remote indigenous communities, however they had also fostered an active local community group to help with the development of the .-hectare site. It was just what I was looking for – a fresh, practical learning environment at an exciting scale to develop new skills. The infrastructure was impressive including solar powered bores, a hybrid (wind and solar) remote area power system, composting toilets and a range of wastewater reuse systems. There were demonstration buildings made from strawbale and mud brick, and the beginnings of a productive landscape including aquaculture ponds, food forest and vegetable gardens. I signed up as a volunteer and was soon spending most of my time there. My home garden was established and thriving and I was enjoying putting my energies into something different. Before long I was employed as site coordinator and spent the next five years managing the ongoing design and development of the site whilst completing my undergraduate degree. Like many good projects we were under-funded financially but were able to achieve a great deal due to the commitment of staff, students and community volunteers. There was a strong shared vision for the importance of demonstrating low impact ways of living and increasing self-reliance. We ran Work for the Dole programs, hosted Corrective Services participants and kept the doors open for anyone who wanted to participate or learn about permaculture. Alongside my site work, I was extremely fortunate to be mentored through a broad range of academic experiences. It was a unique situation where I was expected to teach, present at conferences and undertake field work around WA, all before graduating. This was possible thanks to a progressive group of academics who saw the value in practical experience, recognised passion and provided me with the opportunities to grow.

We are on the lookout for images to help give a wider interpretation of how the design principles can be applied. All of the images used on the principle pages have been included in previous Permaculture Calendars. This website has been designed as a starting point for people who are interested in exploring what permaculture is all about, as well as a place where practitioners can get a better sense of how the principles can be applied. It’s an ideal spot to expose projects that demonstrate permaculture thinking to the hundreds of thousands of people that visit the site each year, as well as the many thousands more who see the calendar up in people homes and offices. Use the #permacultureprinciples on Instagram to make sure we, and everyone else, sees your image. If you like an image, make sure you let the photographer know. You can also use the #tag for the specific principle, for example #observeandinteract (principle name no spaces) if you think that the photo would work best to illustrate that principle. See our Instagram page for more examples. From previous experience it’s good to set yourself an exercise of taking a photo to illustrate a particular principle. This could be a good exercise for permaculture teachers to set students, or a local permaculture group? If you think that you may have something, point me to your online photo library or email me your images and I’ll let you know if there is a possibility or two. Photos with people and/or animals in them tend to fare well as they help bring images to life. I’m after photos (or illustrations) in landscape format that are high resolution jpeg files (around  x  pixels), so that they can be printed at over A size. Email your submissions to [email protected] before the th of April . If your image is selected as the cover for the Permaculture Calendar you’ll receive twelve copies, a further eleven selections will receive four copies along with links and credits – a small token of thanks for successful contributions.

"Rocket stove combustion systems deserve attention for a few reasons: That’s right – you can build these systems in a day or two, and then watch them turn twigs into heat far more efficiently than most wood stoves, with far less set-up cost. If you are good at scavenging bits they can cost virtually nothing to build, and when you prune your fruit trees you can get the fuel you need to cook dinner, heat your home, and enjoy a nice hot shower. The main difference between a normal fireplace or woodstove and a rocket stove is that rocket combustion is close to complete. When wood is burned it releases volatile compounds that we recognise as smoke or soot or creosote. In a rocket stove these compounds are sucked into the insulated and very hot ‘burn tunnel’ of the unit where they combust, releasing even more heat energy to drive the rocket process, unlike a normal fire where they are blown out the chimney. This distinctive sucking of the flames down into the burn tunnel, and the resultant ‘roar’ is what gives rocket stoves their name. This is also a part of their magic. Rocket stoves are open where the wood is fed in, allowing lots of oxygen to be drawn into the unit. As the fire starts, and the burn tunnel heats up, the rising hot air races up the heat riser, drawing lots of air behind it. This incoming air flows into the feed tube and across the burning wood – creating the same effect as pointing a big air-blower at your fire. It gets really hot, the wood burns beautifully, and you hear the air roaring as it charges through the system. In conventional wood stoves the air intake is small, and adjustable to even smaller. This lack of oxygen chokes the combustion, leading to cool burns, incomplete combustion and lots of smoke and creosote. When combustion is complete, what comes out the chimney is pretty much only carbon dioxide, meaning no smoke: smoke means incomplete combustion, unburned fuel, or wasted energy. We are culturally trained to associate smoke with fire; but with rocket stoves, sometimes when there is no smoke, there is still fire! Having ensured complete combustion, and hence maximum heat generation, only then do we think about using the resultant heat. Conventional wood stoves are sucking heat away from the combustion chamber for cooking, space heating or with ‘wet back’ water heaters, meaning the unit just can’t get hot enough for combustion to be complete, resulting in smoke. The combustion chamber of the rocket stove is heavily insulated to prevent premature heat loss, and an enormous amount of heat is generated by the efficient combustion process. When combustion is complete, we can extract heat from the stove at the top of the heat riser. And here is where your imagination and inner inventor can run wild: anything you can think to do with very hot air can be done from this point. Here are a few things that can be powered with a rocket stove. Take care! A well-built rocket stove can work so well it can be dangerous. Dan’s rocket oven once got to  °C in six minutes,  °C in seven minutes, and  °C in thirteen minutes! As for Joel’s latest rocket oven, on his first test run the whole inner skin of the feed tube was glowing red, as was the bottom of the inside of the oven: the thermometer read  °C, and the roast vegies were pretty charred (he has since tamed it down to  °C). While quite popular in some parts of the world, rocket stoves are a relatively rare sight in Australian permaculture systems. They are an excellent example of an appropriate technology alternative to conventional means of heating food, water or space; and they are well worth finding out more about.

 That is the motivation behind our new book, The Art of Frugal Hedonism: A Guide to Spending less While Enjoying Everything More. We coined the phrase ‘frugal hedonist’, to refer to someone who greedily laps up all of life’s non-monetised pleasures, whilst keeping themselves free enough to enjoy these pleasures by under-indulging in ‘comfort and convenience’ spending. Less money spent, equals less pressure to work, equals more flexibility to do the things that make you really happy! So familiar is the notion that consuming less is a sacrifice made for the sake of saving money or conserving resources, that it is easy to resent whatever we are giving up and overlook all the glorious side effects of a thriftier lifestyle. But take a step back, and the picture becomes clearer. While it might at first seem that spending less requires more effort, oversupply of consumables (of the level most modern first-worlders experience) actually has a tendency to turn right back into efforts that we need to expend. For example, the effort required to go to the gym/ weight loss support group/ doctor because you were oversupplied with cheap consumables and labour-saving devices. Not to mention the effort required to go to work to pay for those services. The Frugal Hedonist recognises the efficiency of a little restraint here and there, and the greater pleasures to be gained! Ride to the shops instead of driving, chop up that whopper pumpkin that you grew with an axe and make it into soup to take for lunch instead of buying takeaway, hang out your laundry because you’re too cheap to use a dryer, and base your holidays around hiking to waterfalls rather than eating at new cafes in different places, and the effort required to stay fit and healthy gets taken care of while you were doing other things. Marvellous. Another often-ignored side-effect of restricting our consumption is that it keeps us alive to appreciating the consumption we do do. Scoring an amazing cashmere jumper from a second hand store can only be fully relished by someone who doesn’t have a wardrobe already crammed with impulse buys from every shop in the mall. The pleasure of buying a mango from a street stall to eat messily on a summer’s afternoon park bench can only be as succulent to someone who doesn’t grab a chocolate bar every time they go through a supermarket checkout. Really having not enough is horrible: persistent hunger and cold make you unwell and stressed. Having just enough, plus a little more, is absolutely lovely. Having even more than that, just because it’s the cultural norm, starts to make you unwell and stressed all over again – although the connection is often less obvious. The problems of overabundance and ‘over-ease’ in Western cultures are hitting full stride in the form of our tight waistbands, overstuffed closets and overflowing rubbish tips. Let’s stop denying ourselves the full benefits of a connected, curious, materially-modest, sensually indulgent lifestyle. Let’s get Frugally Hedonistic. Annie Raser-Rowland The Art of Frugal Hedonism: A Guide to Spending less While Enjoying Everything More Annie and Adam have been life long frugalists who are not afraid to enjoy themselves in the process.

"Many of you may have heard about our project by now. Permatil (Permaculture Timor Leste), xpand Foundation and Disruptive Media have come together to produce the Tropical Permaculture Guidebook. Developed from the highly successful Permaculture Guidebook from Timor Leste published by Permatil in ; used by farmers, families, community groups, trainers, government departments, schools, universities, agricultural colleges and NGOs in Timor Leste, and re-used and translated in more than  countries. The guidebook is open source because that is the permaculture way, and with rapid change desperately needed, we need permaculture education and resources to spread as fast as possible. Across the globe it is clear that a big shift is starting to occur; towards small-scale intensive, organic, family owned agriculture systems. We can help accelerate this, and ensure that permaculture’s whole systems design approach is integrated as well. Enabling this change to occur requires farmers and families having access to the information, strategies and techniques they need. On top of this, climate change is already creating havoc with food production and water supplies, and vulnerable communities in the tropics are hardest hit. It will increase dramatically unless fast action is taken. Increasing soil and carbon content in the soil is perhaps the easiest and most important measure needed to reduce climate change. **  This guidebook tackles these fundamental issues on climate change, simultaneously providing permaculture’s solutions and creating community resilience. It turns theory into practical steps that anyone can take and use to affect positive change. All aspects of food production and living are covered, including a focus on agroecological, small-scale, organic food production, integrating crops and based on regenerating soil, water and the surrounding environment.  The new edition is a comprehensive up date; including hundreds of new illustrations, new chapters and techniques, with the content now generalised for all tropical countries. The easy to understand information can be used by readers of all economic and social backgrounds, and with over  detailed illustrations, it is especially useful for semi-literate and illiterate people. Once the English edition is complete, and when further funding is attained, translations to other languages including Spanish, French, Portuguese and national languages will commence. Follow us on Facebook at Tropical Permaculture Guidebook and you can also sign up to the email list to receive occasional updates regarding the progress of the guidebook, both online and printed editions. There are currently six chapters completed and available from www.permacultureguidebook.org with the other chapters being added as they are finished. If you are able to support the project by donating a small amount of money, it will help achieve the production goals and keep the guidebook free for those who can’t afford it. There is a donate button next to the chapters for download, or you can go straight to the crowdfunding campaign.  “Several years ago I came across the original publication and thought what an excellent resource it is for villages and teachers of permaculture. It’s strength lies in the number of strategies and techniques it offer practitioners. The book is easy to handle and well indexed. The drawings are clear and represent a reality for readers. It is especially valuable in being available in several languages. I introduced it to a permaculture design class in East Timor and the students were excited to have information of such good quality. The book’s potential is beyond the islands of SE Asia. For example I had some chapters of the book translated into Luganda in Uganda and it was immediately swallowed up by keen students and we could have printed many many copies. Having taught in so many tropical countries with their range of ecosystems, it is evident that the guidebook needs wider dissemination around the equatorial regions. All equatorial east and west Africa, and then there is South America. One of the problems in disseminating permaculture information is lack of suitable and relevant resources particularly for the tropic regions. I hope the present book will be revised, updated and made available to students and farmers to meet a need for their will and right to know, and render their lives more sustainable and productive.”    Rowe Morrow is the author of several books for permaculture students and teachers.

"My two year student/mentor relationship with Bill from late  was certainly the defining relationship that set the course for the rest of my life. The article ‘A Chance Meeting’ (below) recalled that pivotal moment when I first met Bill and effectively selected him as ‘the teacher’. Bill’s brilliance was in gathering together the ecological insights, principles, strategies and techniques that could be applied to create the world we do want rather than fighting against the world we reject. His personal life was as tumultuous as his public persona, at times tragic but always full of the passion and contradiction that the term ‘ecological warrior’ represents. His legacy lives on in all those who were transformed by his teaching. This tribute by leading British permaculture teacher, Graham Bell, provides an excellent overview of his life including his confronting character.   A seminar “How Patterns of Land Tenure Shape the Exploitation of Natural Resources” sounded mildly interesting. I wondered whether our household efforts at self sufficient living in a rented house with a friendly and helpful landlady might be a relevant example. Most young people seemed to think it was really weird putting so much work into building up the soil and improving the garden, when we didn’t own the house. Well it wasn’t the landlady that was cutting short my tenure. The shared house thing was starting to go sour with John and Sue. They obviously wanted their own space, as a couple with their baby. It was time to move on. But what a pain – with the garden planted and only a month to go before flying back to Western Australia for end year holidays. The seminar, and most of the contributions from the usual participants seemed fairly predictable but there was this guy from the Uni** whose contribution caught my attention. He talked about how rabbit trappers could have controlled rabbits (prior to Myxomatosis) if they had the incentive through a stake in the land (owned by the graziers or the state). Don’t think anyone saw the relevance to the topic (I hadn’t mentioned our insignificant efforts at suburban self sufficiency in a rented property). The discussion meandered back to how urban planning controls could or couldn’t shape urban structure and therefore resource use. Afterwards I went over to speak to this bloke from the Uni. Some of the staff and older post grad students seemed to know him, but I had never seen him around E.D. before. He might have been late forties I supposed, stocky, balding slightly, beard covering protruding chin. Meaty hands and thick nicotine stained fingers; of a working man, I thought. I followed up on his idea; we talked on for ages about the rabbit problem and more. His way of thinking and expression were fascinating; grounded but at same time, holistic. Ecological! I thought, but not like any of the activists who called themselves ecologists, or the academically trained ones, who seemed just as reductionist as most scientists. We exhausted our time, then he asked about my arm being in a sling. A brief recount of the motorbike accident and needing to move out of Blackman’s Bay led to an offer to stay till the end of the school year at his place up Strickland Ave on the slopes of the mountain. Sounded ideal.

"Originally published on the PacificEdge blog. WITHOUT DIRECTION we drift like a ship with a broken engine. With a sense of direction we move forward. But to have direction we have to know where we have come from. We have to know where we are going. The Permaculture Calendar has become a means of knowing that. It represents the temporal framework within which we plan our permaculture journey. The Calendar is the engine of our permaculture ship and it is not broken. Thanks to the work of Richard Telford, each year the Permaculture Calendar appears to document the work of some of the practitioners of this distributed network we call permaculture. In this review of next year’s calendar I want to look at two things: Having just written that subhead I realise I have accidentally borrowed it from the writer, Susan Sontag, who wrote a book with that title. But… onto the value of photography. The calendar demonstrates the value of photography in documenting this social movement of ours. It is no secret that the worldwide web has increased the importance of visual communications such as photography, however the use of calendars as visual media predates the web. Thus, the Calendar acknowledges the primacy of visual communication through photography and continues the tradition of the calendar as a medium for it. It discloses in colour the creativity in permaculture. Through the photography appearing in the Permaculture Calendar over the years of its existence we view a history, a visual story of this design system of ours. The Calendars become a visual story of our collective accomplishments, the works of individual permaculture practitioners and also that of the organisations they set up. We can look back and see what we have done and in doing that we start to get a sense of the continuity, the ongoing history of our design system. If we keep the permaculture calendars over the years we can flick through them and in doing so see our story, or part of it, in full colour. There are five photographs showing some aspect of gardening in the  calendar, one about a technology made by hand, another on the craft production of a utilitarian kitchen tool, one about food, one about building and one about recovery after natural disaster. February’s compost system that moves composting wastes downslope as they go through the composting process I know works because I have seen a similar system in use in a community garden. The material degrades as it is moved downslope but because it is not exposed to the heat that a compost heap produces it does not affect the propagation potential of seeds that might happen to be in it, nor does it complete the composting process. The experience of the community garden I mention was that the partially-degraded material needs to be accumulated into a compost bin or system after being moved downslope. Here, it is exposed to the heat build-up that completes the process and allows the material to cure. April’s image of food storage at a homestead, that avoids the use of electricity, shows the value of producing and storing surplus, though such a low-energy lifeway is available only to the few. There is nothing wrong with homesteading, of course, but modern lifeways militate against it. Despite this, in the best tradition of permaculture people manoeuvre around the problem to adopt some of the elements of the homesteading lifestyle. My partner, for example, preserves fruit and other foods using Fowlers Vacola tech even though we live in a small apartment. Likewise, busy urban working people with no time to make bread the traditional way find a solution in technology with their own electronic breadbot, a bread making machine. Although this domestic automation of the breadmaking process might not appeal to traditionalist home bakers who roll, pummel and knead their bread dough, the breadbot offers home bakers a high degree of control over what goes into their food. Food production in the home garden, where that is available, is another possibility although there is much to be said (and Bill Mollison said it) for buying your food from someone who has produced it responsibly through a food co-op, CSA (community supported agriculture) or the hybrid-CSAs/food hubs we have in the big cities. In so doing we contribute more to building the regional food economy than home growing does. “We can also begin to take some part in food production. This doesn’t mean that we all need to grow our own potatoes, but it may mean that we will buy them directly from a person who is already growing potatoes responsibly. In fact, one would probably do better to organize a farmer-purchasing group in the neighborhood than to grow potatoes.”
…Bill Mollison. October’s wheel of ecological culture I find a somewhat contradictory concept. At one point on the wheel it states ‘technology backgrounded’. Yet, a little further on it states ‘energy powerdown — renewables’. Why the contradiction? Because renewable energy systems are hi-tech, they use new types of materials and computerised, automatic control and distribution systems. If we want a society powered by renewables if follows that we want hi-tech. For the most part the wheel is fine as a conceptual map of what its producers see as valuable in an emergent, resilient culture. March’s image appeals to me most of all, perhaps. Not because it is astounding in any photographic sense but because of what it shows — a scaling-up of permaculture ideas in the city to produce food in bulk. We realise this is already happening when we think of Hobart City Farm, Wagtail Urban Farm in Adelaide and the new Pocket City Farm in inner urban Sydney. These are small urban market gardens producing fresh food on a commercial scale. They are important not only because they enact Bill Mollison’s dictum of returning food production to the city, but because they create livelihoods in the new economy. We know that the new economy emerges from the old, it uses the materials, the fuels, the knowledge of the old to create and build the production capacity, the tools, the technologies, the organisational forms of what will replace it. Small scale, intensively managed farmlets in the city like that in March’s photograph are one of those new systems visible in the old and they scale-up backyard and community garden food production and make it available to more people. Images in the  calendar raise a philosophical question about permaculture. Looking through next year’s calendar I find the  photographs a celebration of gardens, food and the handicraft approach to life. All of this is good and all of those skills valuable, however it comes across as being about past values from, as some might see it, the Nineteenth Century being transposed into the Twenty First. Someone, and I don’t recall who, once said that there is a lot of nostalgia in permaculture. They meant nostalgia for those past times, for the era of manual labour, for the handicraft approach to the provision of our needs. Those skills are still useful for those with the wherewithal and time to practice them. What is absent in the Calendar are images of people interacting with modern technology, yet so many permaculture people I know interact with it every day, making modern tech as much about permaculture as the craft technologies. Let’s stop talking about photography and the philosophy of permaculture for a moment to consider the man who produces this calendar. Richard Telford. It is through Richard’s gift of good graphic design that we have the calendar. And through his persistence in producing a new edition year after year. Richard’s work amply demonstrates how publishing, photography and writing — all fall within the ‘invisible systems’ of permaculture — are as much permaculture skills as are growing cabbages or building a small house. Those are the skills through which we, as a social movement, get to know ourself. Without the skill of the photographer, permaculture journalist, author and publisher permaculture would remain ignorant of its challenges, its achievements, its story. It would have no story, no history. The Permaculture Calendar  brings us a visual continuity of that history. So, here we are. … a new permaculture Calendar for a new year. A calendar that through the practice of photography records this design system that we inhabit and in doing so provides us with that sense of continuity I mentioned earlier. But… Richard’s producing the Permaculture Calendar  is only part of the story. Someone has to buy it this year if we want another calendar next year. Buying the Permaculture Calendar  is a vote with our dollar for Richard to produce more editions. Our purchase money is the energy those future editions run on. Our purchase is a way to encourage Richard to produce the calendar over coming years. What better Christmas gift could there be to remind those receiving it of permaculture’s accomplishments, month after month. We don’t actually need Christmas, however, for the calendar offers a way to say thank you to someone who has done us a favour, who has helped us out or whose work we value. It is recognition of another’s value in print form. In giving the calendar we give those receiving it the idea that there are other ways of doing things, there are alternative futures.

Sunrise Farm in Rani Patati village near Kathmandu, is a community farm owned & managed by Mr Shyam Shrestha & his family. It is a working farm, established in , offering demonstration, training and seed & seedling distribution facilities. The farm also runs a program committed to the demonstration and training of sustainable agriculture and community development techniques and approaches Various foods and resources are grown & harvested including roots, grain, leaf, fruit & flower crops from trees, shrubs, grasses and herbs plus firewood, animal fodder and mulch. Crops are protected by integrated pest management strategies, encouraged by microclimate creation and use, etc Immediately after the earthquakes, hundreds of people descended on the farm’s land in order to be away from large buildings that were collapsing all around. The farmhouse was structurally damaged and unsafe and the barn was totally destroyed. Many people, sheltered under hastily constructed plastic tarps, including the Shrestha family. They cooked for dozens of refugees for  days until emergency services, water & electricity reached the area. They continued catering for their community for some weeks, using the farm’s abundant vegetables and grains grown in the organic no-till beds.  Following a crowd funding appeal, donations and a micro-grant from Permafund, work to rebuild Sunrise Farm started in November . However, at the start it was affected by the embargo on Nepal by India that ran from September  until January . Commodities became unavailable or at best, prohibitively expensive, as fuel became rare. Again, while the city starved of cooking gas, forests around the valley began to be stripped. Sunrise Farm was able to cook on its ageing biogas unit fueled by recycled manure plus biomass, supplemented by firewood from the agroforestry section of the farm. This delay time was used for planning & research of the best methods of re-building. As funds accrued, work started in December with de-construction of damaged areas of the house and barn and recycling of the materials. The house build involved jacking up existing concrete beams and strengthening them with new and stronger beams, infilling with traditional brickwork using partially recycled bricks from the demolished walls and partially stabilised compressed earth bricks (SCEBs). The SCEBs were manufactured using a hydraulic ram made in Nepal with an earth and % cement mix. They were not fired. The house has now been completely restored, except for plastering and painting. This will be done in the Autumn (Spring in Southern Hemisphere) of , following a planned training course in lime plastering. Meanwhile work has started on the barn. Sunrise Farm was fortunate to meet International Disaster Volunteers (IDV) with whom they struck up a partnership and who provided an architect and constant stream of volunteers to help the Sunrise Farm family. The barn was built using a combination of SCEBs, stone & mud mortar plus bamboo (both as structural beams and woven as wall fabric), with a corrugated tin and Perspex roof for extra light. Like the house, the barn is complete except for pleasuring and painting. Currently the family is constructing the new training hall. International Disaster Volunteers are helping with this too. The aim is to have this complete, or at least covered, before the monsoon sets in. Sunrise Farm has already begun to host training and demonstration projects thanks to the help of the crowd funding and donations. Permaculture diploma induction events and farmers’ field trip visits will be included. Permafund have provided a micro-grant to support this project, as well as supporting other permaculture projects around the world.

Isabella Guerrini, at the University of Perugia in Italy, works in the department of agriculture studying plant and animal consciousness and its integration into ecological pattern and rhythm. Her observations of sap flow in plants confirm that, indeed, fluid flows more full as the moon becomes full, slowing down as the moon wanes. This, she explains, has important consequences for plant growth and pruning: vigorous, sappy plants will suffer if cut, harvested, or pruned close to the full moon. First off, leaking sap exposes the plant to disease and pest incursion. But furthermore, sap from a cut plant, now deprived of its primary outlet, will engorge smaller channels, where new buds are developing on side branches, and potentially rupture those channels leading to the death of the buds (a phenomenon known as “lunar burn”, because it was so often noted around the full moon). Less vigorous, less juicy plants, like ground-covers or vines, conversely may benefit from being cut when sap flow is strong: it will stimulate the development of side shoots and encourage fuller, branching growth. Those who work with plants every day have certainly noticed differences in moisture content, flavor (meaning chemistry), and more. This can have important consequences across a range of applications, from medicine to construction. For an excellent review of the subject, see Ian Cole and Michael Balick’s review article. The authors discuss a range of traditional practices related to moon phase, from the harvesting of construction and thatch materials, to the planting of staple crops, to the gathering of medicines. In their review of some contemporary research, they catalog differences in plant chemistry and fluid balance based on seasonal and circadian (day-long) rhythms, but note that studies that examine lunar rhythms are still few and far between. In my personal experimentation, I concur that flavor and phytochemical variation is most noticeable as part of a seasonal cycle, but moisture content (once variables such as rainfall are accounted for) is very closely tied to lunar cycles. Water weight in a botanical sample can vary up to % between the days just before the full moon and the week before the new moon. This parallels what researchers have found in lumber: wood from spruce and chestnut, harvested in the last week of the moon phase, has the lowest water percentage and shrinks the least during drying. It is rumored that the wooden stilts upon which Venice was built all were harvested during the last few days of the moon cycle: less water and denser fibers means less susceptibility to rotting and parasites. Ernst Zürcher, who published the research on lumber harvesting, expanded on Cole and Balick’s work, cataloging the changes in moisture content, as well as effects on plant germination, growth, and development in many different plants as relates to lunar cycles. The conclusions are consistent: there is indeed a lunar effect. But he also points out that the easy explanation (a tide-like gravitational force) is most likely incorrect, as the amount of water in even the largest tree is relatively small, and a tidal force would be negligible. An intriguing hypothesis is that moonlight itself may contribute to electromagnetic effects that alter the surface tension of water, allowing for some of the microscopic effects that have been experimentally documented. All plants grow differently during different phases of the moon—this has been observed in scientific research since the s and, more recently, documented on the microscopic level by observing changes in rootlet growth. But as to why—this question is still unresolved. What we do know is that moonlight, while generally similar to the sunlight it reflects, shifts a bit towards the infrared (see above spectral graph, from CIRA, at Colorado State University) and also has some gaps that may be linked to the presence of traces of sodium in the lunar “atmosphere”. This makes moonlight not just a less intense version of sunlight—it is somewhat qualitatively different, too. Dr. Guerrini has speculated that the rhythmic, additional irradiation from moonlight is an important adjunct to the growth and metabolism of healthy plants: not only have we seen change in growth and leaf movements, but also in patterns of starch storage (highest in the waning phase) and utilization (highest in the days before the full moon). These effects, along with preliminary documentation of immune deficiency and poor wound healing from moonlight-deprived plants, encourage us to think of moonlight as an important part of a plant’s overall “nutrition”. Interestingly, this “nutrition” seems to be more a modulation of bio-electric activity rather than a source of photosynthetic energy. In conclusion, moonlight is subtle—typically, even at its peak, only about % as strong as sunlight. But its rays penetrate the soil, and affect plant life from germination to harvest. Most plants seem to need a rhythmic exposure to moonlight—at least for a week or so around the full moon—for optimal immunity, wound healing, regeneration, and growth. Plant harvesting should ideally heed the lunar cycle, not simply for potency and low water content, but because many plants (especially strong, vigorous growers) recover better when they are harvested during the last week of the lunar cycle. It seems that the subtle effects of moonlight can alter the way water behaves as it interfaces with living cells, perhaps through bio-electric mechanisms. As the old myths tell us, the moon is a powerful force, regulating the unseen, yin-like processes hidden under the surfaces of things, deeply connected to water and moisture. Easy explanations of its effects can often be misdirection – the moon may seem to lay out a trail for us, but this trail often leads to places we’d never expect. But just as tidal forces served to shape early life on our planet, the more hidden effects we are just starting to understand may be essential to maintain healthy life on earth today.  While the factors that affect plant growth are complex and vary greatly, the basic concept is really quite simple. As the moon increases in light towards the full moon, sap flow is more active. Conversely, as the moon wanes, sap flow slows.

At the turn of the st century the evidence for energy descent driven by peak oil and climate change was already strong. The quasi religious belief in continuous economic growth had a strong hold on collective psychology in central Victoria as much as anywhere in the world. The global financial system began to unravel in  at the same time that global production of conventional oil peaked. For a minority it was increasingly obvious that the policies put in place ensured that the collapse was even more severe when it did come. It was like the powers that be had pushed the accelerator hard to the floor in one of those supercharged sports cars of the time, to attempt to jump across the widening chasm that humanity was facing. The collapse of global financial growth unfolded differently in different places but here the story had many upsides that were partly due to luck and partly a result of visionaries and innovators who helped create a better future. These are the bare bones of how we got from what a few people still consider was the golden age to what we call the Earth Steward culture. In  the Australian property bubble burst. For our communities, this marked the start of the First Energy Descent Crisis (of the st century). Ballarat Bank was the first financial institution to fail and a government forced take over by the Commonwealth Bank saw the Community Bank network hived off as local lending co-ops backed by local government hoping to restart economic activity in regional towns that were increasingly on their own as State and Federal governments focused on dealing with hardship and social unrest in the cities. The crisis was world wide, so dramatically reduced global Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the peak of global oil (what they called Total Liquids at the time) the same year was very much in line with the  Limits To Growth report default scenario showing industrial output peaking about that time. More recent studies suggest that net energy available to support humanity peaked closer to the turn of the millennium but it’s all a moot point because it seems that economic growth had been a net drain on human welfare for decades before that. As capital investment in oil fell off a cliff, and production from existing fields declined at nearly % there was a second oil price shock, a US currency collapse and a short war between the USA and China in . Australia got punished in the trade embargo imposed by China. The economic crisis in China had already caused nearly  million of the recently urbanised workers to return to the villages, and reimposition of a command economy to continue the shift to renewable energy and revitalise agriculture. Consequently China was able to cope without Australian coal and gas and there was so much scrap steel in the world that the iron ore exports had come to a standstill. While oil and food remained costly (at least relative to falling wages) most manufactured goods were dirt-cheap. Solar panels from China (somehow getting around the trade embargo) accelerated the trend for retail customers going off grid which, combined with collapse of commercial demand for electricity, led to a “Death Spiral” in the power grid with rising prices and increasing blackouts (and surges due to excess wind and solar inputs). A newly elected Federal Labor government renationalised the power grid, along with price controls, rationing an Australia ID card allowing rationed access to subsidised supermarkets that had been experiencing shortages of fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy. In Victoria, a Liberal government implemented policies to encourage people to be more self-reliant. Permaculture education was adopted as a framework for integrating aspects of self-reliance including home food production, owner building, water harvesting and waste management. Rationing of fuel led to hitch-hiking, ride sharing and in rural areas a rush to convert vehicles to wood gas. Bicycles became the default personal transport around town in Castlemanine but in Daylesford and Hepburn, electric bikes and vehicles powered by the Hepburn Wind charging stations installed for tourists before the property bubble burst maintained mobility for locals. Conversion of vehicles to wood gas by a range of bush mechanics and ex-hot rodders had mixed success. The market value of higher powered larger vehicles and trucks rose as a result of the first wave of conversions. The Castlemaine Obtainium Engineering Institute was established to test and improve local designs and prototypes. One of the motivations was a competitive spirit with the electric car networks centred in Daylesford and Ballarat. Use of Bitcoin (a virtual currency), local currencies, precious metals and barter all increased to support exchange in the rapidly growing informal and grey economies. Bitcoin then failed in mysterious circumstances after being targeted for funding terrorism. The Internet began functioning again after major breakdowns during the conflict between the US and China. But Facebook and Amazon were bankrupt, cyberspace was littered with defunct and unmaintained sites and Internet marketing was plagued by cyber crime and draconian government regulations. Local computer networks using wireless technology, as well as a revival of two-way radio, started building back to basics communication pathways.;Permaculture Principles
We are always on the lookout for images to help give a wider interpretation of how the design principles can be applied. All of the images used on the principle pages have been included in previous Permaculture Calendars, which is now in it’s th incarnation. This website has been designed as a starting point for people who are interested in exploring what permaculture is all about, as well as a place where practitioners can get a better sense of how the principles can be applied. It’s an ideal spot to expose projects that demonstrate permaculture thinking to the hundreds of thousands of people that visit the site each year, as well as the many thousands more who see the calendar up in people homes and offices.  From previous experience it’s good to set yourself an exercise of taking a photo to illustrate a particular principle. This could be a good exercise for permaculture teachers to set students, or a local permaculture group? Permaculture Northern Beaches in Sydney ran a photo competition with the ‘Stalled by the Roadside’ image selected for the  calendar. If you think that you may have something, point me to your online photo library or email me your images and I’ll let you know if there is a possibility or two. Photos with people and/or animals in them tend to fare well as they help bring images to life. I’m after photos (or illustrations) in landscape format that are high resolution jpeg files (around  x  pixels), so that they can be printed at over A size. Email your submissions to [email protected] before the th of June . If your image is selected as the cover for the Permaculture Calendar you’ll receive twelve copies, a further eleven selections will receive four copies along with links and credits – a small token of thanks for successful contributions. Think of the exposure it will bring to your project. For inspiration, check out the collection on each of the design principle pages. Happy snapping! Richard Telford ;Permaculture Principles
"This is a bittersweet farewell and celebration as we say hoo-roo to the Permaculture Principles calendar after  years.  years! That’s  months of appreciation for permaculture projects around the world, and nearly  days of permaculture having pride of place on walls everywhere. We’ve contributed over $,AU to support permaculture projects and change makers too – something we’re proud to reflect upon. As anyone with a wall calendar will attest, those little daily boxes become the custodians of all kinds of precious information; plantings, gatherings, rainfall, heatwaves, loved one’s birthdays, moods, homesteading to-dos and the occasional absentminded work of art. It has been a joy to create each calendar knowing that thousands of people are sharing the same daily experience, noticing and capturing the small, vital stuff of life. And long after each calendar “expires”, it lives on as a treasured time capsule; a ledger of all your legendary permaculture antics – we know that many of these calendars will be in use for years to come. There are still two months to enjoy, but we do realise that many people are getting organised and looking for a calendar to take them into . It won’t be ours, we are sorry to say… but hey, it has been wonderful! Massive thanks to the Permaculture Calendar team who have brought it all together, including the original designers David Arnold and Richard Telford. To Oliver Holmgren, Christine Cahusac, Grace and Felix as well as Emma O’Dell, we are so grateful for your tireless work. Printing in Australia on ethically sourced paper has been supplied from Print Together, Moule Print, Focus Print Group and Printgraphics. A very special thanks to all of the wonderful calendar contributors who furnished each month with permie inspiration. (You can still access all of the images from every contributor on the Permaculture Principles website, by the way.) And to you, a supporter of this special project over the years, we extend our heartfelt gratitude. Permaculture Principles remains deeply committed to celebrating permaculture projects globally, and are on the cusp of launching an exciting new project very soon (hint: it’s educational and free!). With warmth, The Permaculture Principles team P.S. If you’ve yet to dive deeply into the principles, try reading Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability. Or for a brain-illuminating immersion, consider doing a Permaculture Design Course, like the Ashram PDC or Online PDC with co-originator David Holmgren.";Permaculture Principles
"In the hills east of Canberra, down a dusty lane that passes racehorses dozing in thick phalaris, and wild apple trees and thickets of plum and hawthorn, then winds up the Lake George escarpment through Yellow Box woodland full of finches, thornbills, cuckoo-shrikes, kookaburras and robins, there’s a rusty old gate with a stencilled sign that says “Millpost”. The heritage of our farm is long, complex and rich; challenging to protect in a time of climatic and economic uncertainty. As custodians for thirty-nine years, our family has endeavoured to preserve and enrich this landscape, while earning enough from the land to enjoy the privilege of maintaining stewardship. Permaculture Principle #: Obtain a Yield In January  David and I attended the first-ever PDC at Stanley, Tasmania with Bill Mollison. The insights we gained have guided our decision-making ever since. Minimising food miles, creating stability through diversity, turning problems into assets, zero waste, small-scale and local solutions…these have been our bywords. Millpost was windswept and degraded when David first arrived in . Since then, we’ve planted or direct-seeded approximately  kilometres of native windbreaks using Eucalyptus, Acacia, Bursaria, Callistemon and Casuarinas. Sheep are excluded from about  hectares, including riparian zones, to allow natural regeneration. Stock and wildlife alike benefit from shade and shelter in every paddock. Big increases in bird populations ( sp.) mean improved natural pest control. But it’s not all good news; the resulting increase in kangaroo numbers threatens our viability. Deciduous trees such as poplar, willow, oak, ash, honey locust and black locust are planted strategically to provide fire protection for the homestead complex, as well as stock fodder, shade and food (fruit and nuts). If they sucker, all the better! Both native and exotic trees are harvested for timber (building and fence posts) and firewood (heating and cooking). By harvesting water from shed roofs uphill from dwellings, we use the Permaculture strategy of storing water at the highest possible point and using gravity to move it, rather than relying on pumps. We also place dams as high as possible in the landscape to enable gravity-feeding of water for stock or gardens. Principle #:Catch and Store Energy. David Holmgren created a Whole Farm Plan for us in . We are gradually implementing the design, moving from  large paddocks back in the s to about  today, which we subdivide further with portable electric fencing. The new paddocks allow us to spell over % of the farm at any one time and to keep the sheep out of wet areas when necessary. Our main challenge has been making a living from a relatively infertile farm, especially in frequent severe droughts. Our Permaculture system allowed us to survive low wool prices and other adversities because producing our own food (vegies, fruit, meat, eggs and dairy produce) has lowered our cost of living. Today’s challenge is to provide a livelihood here for our children and their families. We hope our diversification venture, Millpost Merino knitting yarn, will help our family farm survive. Principle #: Integrate Rather than Segregate Our native pastures (more than % of the farm) are botanically diverse and yield well even in drought. Principle #: Use and Value Diversity Bill Mollison told us the difference between conventional farmers and Permaculturists was that the former looked at the land and asked: how can this land be made to produce dollars? Whereas the latter asked: what does it (nature) offer? Principle #: Observe and Interact Merino wool is the finest, softest wool in the world as a result of centuries of careful breeding programmes. Merino sheep can withstand climatic extremes and still produce this robust yet soft, multi-functional fibre for making clothing that can last a lifetime. We are taking the Stewardship approach to our wool enterprise, by protecting and enhancing the endangered temperate native grasslands (including Grassy Yellow Box Woodlands) that make up much of the  hectares of Millpost farm. Sheep are a regenerative tool: they graze pasture hard for short periods then move on to a fresh paddock, allowing grasslands enough time to recover between grazing events. Depending on seasonal conditions, paddocks may be grazed briefly only two or three times per year. We are starting small, with only the very best of our fine wool clip (three bales) being processed for yarn. Principle #: Use Small and Slow Solutions  David’s book Millpost: a broadscale permaculture farm since  is available from our Australian webstore or from the yarn website millpostmerino.com.au";Permaculture Principles
 I discovered the magic of gardening at an early age, looking after Dad’s herbs at home. As a keen cook, he kept quite a collection. There must have been thirty different varieties with each one growing in an individual terracotta pot, neatly lined up in rows on a tiered planter shelf. It was my job to keep them in top shape. Hand watering was a daily task in Perth’s hot, dry summer. Regular feeding to keep the growth soft and palatable, and occasional re-potting, division and replanting – all simple tasks that made a big impact on me. These were the first things that I nurtured and the result of these efforts ended up in our dinner most evenings. My next garden project was a bit more ambitious. At fourteen I set up a four-square-metre ‘no-dig’ vegie patch on top of the lawn in our backyard. I was fascinated by how a few bales of straw, a load of compost and a handful of seeds could be converted into bundles of fresh vegetables within a matter of months. I often tell people that growing food is highly infectious. Once you make a start the sense of satisfaction and reward is overwhelming. I can still vividly recall the moment when it really hit me. It was late one warm afternoon and I had been working in my little patch, which by this stage had expanded to include a number of large tubs filled with tomatoes and climbing beans trailing along the fence. I sat on the lawn, leaning back against the warm red brick wall of our shed and basked in the contentment and satisfaction with what I had created. From that point on I’ve considered myself a gardener. Dad picked up on my new fascination with gardening. As a keen book collector he was thrilled to see me fossicking in second hand book shops as I slowly developed a collection of my own. One evening he gave me two books that he had bought years before and tucked away in a forgotten section of his library. They were first edition copies of Permaculture One and Permaculture Two. They made immediate sense to me. The ideas were logical, the principles were practical and the ethical basis underpinning it all was fair and just. The more I read, the more I started to question things, especially life in a comfortable suburb, living in high energy, wasteful homes, surrounded by high maintenance unproductive landscapes. It was all wrong. Clearly there must be a better way to do it. I realised that I needed to learn more about the natural world and the way that it worked. This realisation influenced my subject selection in high school and eventually led me to study environmental science at university, but it was always the practical aspects of permaculture that kept me inspired. My interest in permaculture got a major boost at the age of nineteen when I stumbled across a neglected suburban block with potential. It was a classic run down rental property that still retained the features typical to the original s homes in the area. There were old fruit trees, a hen shed, a dilapidated glass house and a workshop. There were remnant native species that, given their age, would have pre-dated the development of the area. It was like a time capsule. All around it, time had moved on. Dalkeith was now a prestigious riverside address noted for its leafy gardens and proximity to private schools. Meanwhile number  Circe Circle was still like something out of the BBC classic The Good Life. My brother was renting the place with his mates. The first time I visited I thought to myself, “I’ve got to get this place!” Timing was on my side and it wasn’t long before he moved out and I moved in. And so began my first serious garden project. Being my first rental property, I wasn’t exactly sure of what the rules were when it came to working in the garden. The place was a complete mess so I assumed that any work tidying up was bound to be appreciated. I started off tentatively. I was busy studying at university and was also running a part-time local gardening round, so my early efforts were mainly limited to exploring the various nooks and crannies of the block. Each session was like an archaeological dig. The more things I’d discovered including old tools and forgotten pathways, the more intrigued I became with the garden. It wasn’t long before I decided the best thing to do was to drop down to part-time study and take this project more seriously. Whether it was my growing passion for gardening or an avoidance strategy for chemistry and statistics is beside the point – it was the best thing I ever did. Over the next six years, my housemates and I rejuvenated the property and created a remarkable garden that combined friendship, learning, fun with a real feeling of independence and self-reliance. We pulled the lawn up, repaired the glasshouse, repaired the sheds, installed a rainwater tank and set up trellises for growing fruit trees and vines. We built new pens for ducks and aviaries for pigeons and quail. We experimented with solar ovens and composting toilets, brewed beer and baked bread. It was brilliant. Being poor students we learnt how to be resourceful with salvaged materials and created a space with rambling pathways, extended poultry runs, homemade garden seats, worm farms and compost bays. We basically overhauled the place and it wasn’t long until I actually felt as if the property was ours. What we did buy, we bought locally. There was a small group of shops around the corner called the ‘Dalkeith Village’ which had been there (in more humble form) since the suburb began in the s. There was a bakery, a little supermarket, a bottle shop, a nursery and even a small father-son owned hardware store where you could still buy individual nails. Of course they charged like a wounded bull, earning the proprietor the nickname ‘Old Man Fleece’ amongst my housemates, but that didn’t really matter. It was more important for us to know that we were supporting local businesses, which provided the convenience, comfort and security that we had what we needed near by. In time we struck up great relationships with our elderly neighbours. Most had been there for some forty plus years and remembered a time when everyone had fruit trees and chooks in their backyard. I’m sure that they thought we were odd to start with, but when they realised we were really having a go, their interest grew. It wasn’t long before I was passing eggs and homegrown produce over the fence. In return they would make jams, give tips on the best local plant varieties and dear old Mrs James up the back would throw her scraps over for our chooks. There was a real sense of community. My friends were also fascinated. When people visited they’d head straight for the chooks. At night I’d give tours by torchlight to explore the jungle like garden and spot frogs. Being born in the mid s, we were part of a generation that didn’t automatically connect with gardening and self-reliance. Perhaps that was part of the buzz for me, in that we were doing something different – something inherently practical and something that just made sense. In , the th International Permaculture Conference (IPC) was to be held in Perth, and with it a special Permaculture Design Course (PDC) was to be run involving a number of respected WA permaculturists as guest teachers. I’d been planning to do my PDC for a while, but as a student, time and cost were always an issue. Attending IPC was an opportunity too good to miss. I deferred from university for a semester, cranked up the gardening round to save up some money and registered for the design course and conference. By this stage, I was confident with many of the practical aspects of permaculture from the hands-on skills that I had developed in my backyard and on my gardening round, but I was eager to explore new concepts in design and relate them to my academic studies. The PDC, conference and site tours that followed certainly provided this and made me realise that it was time to leave the comfort of my backyard and neighbourhood and expand my skill set by working on other projects. As always an opportunity soon presented itself. One of the site tours we took during the PDC was to the Environmental Technology Centre at Murdoch University (the university where I was studying). It was a fascinating project which had been set up as a research and development facility to explore the applications of small-scale environmental technologies in the areas of water supply, sanitation, energy, shelter, and food production. The research group’s main focus at the time was the application of appropriate technologies for improved environmental health in remote indigenous communities, however they had also fostered an active local community group to help with the development of the .-hectare site. It was just what I was looking for – a fresh, practical learning environment at an exciting scale to develop new skills. The infrastructure was impressive including solar powered bores, a hybrid (wind and solar) remote area power system, composting toilets and a range of wastewater reuse systems. There were demonstration buildings made from strawbale and mud brick, and the beginnings of a productive landscape including aquaculture ponds, food forest and vegetable gardens. I signed up as a volunteer and was soon spending most of my time there. My home garden was established and thriving and I was enjoying putting my energies into something different. Before long I was employed as site coordinator and spent the next five years managing the ongoing design and development of the site whilst completing my undergraduate degree. Like many good projects we were under-funded financially but were able to achieve a great deal due to the commitment of staff, students and community volunteers. There was a strong shared vision for the importance of demonstrating low impact ways of living and increasing self-reliance. We ran Work for the Dole programs, hosted Corrective Services participants and kept the doors open for anyone who wanted to participate or learn about permaculture. Alongside my site work, I was extremely fortunate to be mentored through a broad range of academic experiences. It was a unique situation where I was expected to teach, present at conferences and undertake field work around WA, all before graduating. This was possible thanks to a progressive group of academics who saw the value in practical experience, recognised passion and provided me with the opportunities to grow.

We are on the lookout for images to help give a wider interpretation of how the design principles can be applied. All of the images used on the principle pages have been included in previous Permaculture Calendars. This website has been designed as a starting point for people who are interested in exploring what permaculture is all about, as well as a place where practitioners can get a better sense of how the principles can be applied. It’s an ideal spot to expose projects that demonstrate permaculture thinking to the hundreds of thousands of people that visit the site each year, as well as the many thousands more who see the calendar up in people homes and offices. Use the #permacultureprinciples on Instagram to make sure we, and everyone else, sees your image. If you like an image, make sure you let the photographer know. You can also use the #tag for the specific principle, for example #observeandinteract (principle name no spaces) if you think that the photo would work best to illustrate that principle. See our Instagram page for more examples. From previous experience it’s good to set yourself an exercise of taking a photo to illustrate a particular principle. This could be a good exercise for permaculture teachers to set students, or a local permaculture group? If you think that you may have something, point me to your online photo library or email me your images and I’ll let you know if there is a possibility or two. Photos with people and/or animals in them tend to fare well as they help bring images to life. I’m after photos (or illustrations) in landscape format that are high resolution jpeg files (around  x  pixels), so that they can be printed at over A size. Email your submissions to [email protected] before the th of April . If your image is selected as the cover for the Permaculture Calendar you’ll receive twelve copies, a further eleven selections will receive four copies along with links and credits – a small token of thanks for successful contributions. Think of the exposure it will bring to your project.

"Rocket stove combustion systems deserve attention for a few reasons: That’s right – you can build these systems in a day or two, and then watch them turn twigs into heat far more efficiently than most wood stoves, with far less set-up cost. If you are good at scavenging bits they can cost virtually nothing to build, and when you prune your fruit trees you can get the fuel you need to cook dinner, heat your home, and enjoy a nice hot shower. The main difference between a normal fireplace or woodstove and a rocket stove is that rocket combustion is close to complete. When wood is burned it releases volatile compounds that we recognise as smoke or soot or creosote. In a rocket stove these compounds are sucked into the insulated and very hot ‘burn tunnel’ of the unit where they combust, releasing even more heat energy to drive the rocket process, unlike a normal fire where they are blown out the chimney. This distinctive sucking of the flames down into the burn tunnel, and the resultant ‘roar’ is what gives rocket stoves their name. This is also a part of their magic. Rocket stoves are open where the wood is fed in, allowing lots of oxygen to be drawn into the unit. As the fire starts, and the burn tunnel heats up, the rising hot air races up the heat riser, drawing lots of air behind it. This incoming air flows into the feed tube and across the burning wood – creating the same effect as pointing a big air-blower at your fire. It gets really hot, the wood burns beautifully, and you hear the air roaring as it charges through the system. In conventional wood stoves the air intake is small, and adjustable to even smaller. This lack of oxygen chokes the combustion, leading to cool burns, incomplete combustion and lots of smoke and creosote. When combustion is complete, what comes out the chimney is pretty much only carbon dioxide, meaning no smoke: smoke means incomplete combustion, unburned fuel, or wasted energy. We are culturally trained to associate smoke with fire; but with rocket stoves, sometimes when there is no smoke, there is still fire! Having ensured complete combustion, and hence maximum heat generation, only then do we think about using the resultant heat. Conventional wood stoves are sucking heat away from the combustion chamber for cooking, space heating or with ‘wet back’ water heaters, meaning the unit just can’t get hot enough for combustion to be complete, resulting in smoke. The combustion chamber of the rocket stove is heavily insulated to prevent premature heat loss, and an enormous amount of heat is generated by the efficient combustion process. When combustion is complete, we can extract heat from the stove at the top of the heat riser. And here is where your imagination and inner inventor can run wild: anything you can think to do with very hot air can be done from this point. Here are a few things that can be powered with a rocket stove. Take care! A well-built rocket stove can work so well it can be dangerous. Dan’s rocket oven once got to  °C in six minutes,  °C in seven minutes, and  °C in thirteen minutes! As for Joel’s latest rocket oven, on his first test run the whole inner skin of the feed tube was glowing red, as was the bottom of the inside of the oven: the thermometer read  °C, and the roast vegies were pretty charred (he has since tamed it down to  °C). While quite popular in some parts of the world, rocket stoves are a relatively rare sight in Australian permaculture systems. They are an excellent example of an appropriate technology alternative to conventional means of heating food, water or space; and they are well worth finding out more about.

 That is the motivation behind our new book, The Art of Frugal Hedonism: A Guide to Spending less While Enjoying Everything More. We coined the phrase ‘frugal hedonist’, to refer to someone who greedily laps up all of life’s non-monetised pleasures, whilst keeping themselves free enough to enjoy these pleasures by under-indulging in ‘comfort and convenience’ spending. Less money spent, equals less pressure to work, equals more flexibility to do the things that make you really happy! So familiar is the notion that consuming less is a sacrifice made for the sake of saving money or conserving resources, that it is easy to resent whatever we are giving up and overlook all the glorious side effects of a thriftier lifestyle. But take a step back, and the picture becomes clearer. While it might at first seem that spending less requires more effort, oversupply of consumables (of the level most modern first-worlders experience) actually has a tendency to turn right back into efforts that we need to expend. For example, the effort required to go to the gym/ weight loss support group/ doctor because you were oversupplied with cheap consumables and labour-saving devices. Not to mention the effort required to go to work to pay for those services. The Frugal Hedonist recognises the efficiency of a little restraint here and there, and the greater pleasures to be gained! Ride to the shops instead of driving, chop up that whopper pumpkin that you grew with an axe and make it into soup to take for lunch instead of buying takeaway, hang out your laundry because you’re too cheap to use a dryer, and base your holidays around hiking to waterfalls rather than eating at new cafes in different places, and the effort required to stay fit and healthy gets taken care of while you were doing other things. Marvellous. Another often-ignored side-effect of restricting our consumption is that it keeps us alive to appreciating the consumption we do do. Scoring an amazing cashmere jumper from a second hand store can only be fully relished by someone who doesn’t have a wardrobe already crammed with impulse buys from every shop in the mall. The pleasure of buying a mango from a street stall to eat messily on a summer’s afternoon park bench can only be as succulent to someone who doesn’t grab a chocolate bar every time they go through a supermarket checkout. Really having not enough is horrible: persistent hunger and cold make you unwell and stressed. Having just enough, plus a little more, is absolutely lovely. Having even more than that, just because it’s the cultural norm, starts to make you unwell and stressed all over again – although the connection is often less obvious. The problems of overabundance and ‘over-ease’ in Western cultures are hitting full stride in the form of our tight waistbands, overstuffed closets and overflowing rubbish tips. Let’s stop denying ourselves the full benefits of a connected, curious, materially-modest, sensually indulgent lifestyle. Let’s get Frugally Hedonistic. Annie Raser-Rowland The Art of Frugal Hedonism: A Guide to Spending less While Enjoying Everything More Annie and Adam have been life long frugalists who are not afraid to enjoy themselves in the process. Their quirky, and sometimes, confronting take on modern life is a welcome new direction in a world of over-abundance and abject poverty.

"Many of you may have heard about our project by now. Permatil (Permaculture Timor Leste), xpand Foundation and Disruptive Media have come together to produce the Tropical Permaculture Guidebook. Developed from the highly successful Permaculture Guidebook from Timor Leste published by Permatil in ; used by farmers, families, community groups, trainers, government departments, schools, universities, agricultural colleges and NGOs in Timor Leste, and re-used and translated in more than  countries. The guidebook is open source because that is the permaculture way, and with rapid change desperately needed, we need permaculture education and resources to spread as fast as possible. Across the globe it is clear that a big shift is starting to occur; towards small-scale intensive, organic, family owned agriculture systems. We can help accelerate this, and ensure that permaculture’s whole systems design approach is integrated as well. Enabling this change to occur requires farmers and families having access to the information, strategies and techniques they need. On top of this, climate change is already creating havoc with food production and water supplies, and vulnerable communities in the tropics are hardest hit. It will increase dramatically unless fast action is taken. Increasing soil and carbon content in the soil is perhaps the easiest and most important measure needed to reduce climate change. **  This guidebook tackles these fundamental issues on climate change, simultaneously providing permaculture’s solutions and creating community resilience. It turns theory into practical steps that anyone can take and use to affect positive change. All aspects of food production and living are covered, including a focus on agroecological, small-scale, organic food production, integrating crops and based on regenerating soil, water and the surrounding environment.  The new edition is a comprehensive up date; including hundreds of new illustrations, new chapters and techniques, with the content now generalised for all tropical countries. The easy to understand information can be used by readers of all economic and social backgrounds, and with over  detailed illustrations, it is especially useful for semi-literate and illiterate people. Once the English edition is complete, and when further funding is attained, translations to other languages including Spanish, French, Portuguese and national languages will commence. Follow us on Facebook at Tropical Permaculture Guidebook and you can also sign up to the email list to receive occasional updates regarding the progress of the guidebook, both online and printed editions. There are currently six chapters completed and available from www.permacultureguidebook.org with the other chapters being added as they are finished. If you are able to support the project by donating a small amount of money, it will help achieve the production goals and keep the guidebook free for those who can’t afford it. There is a donate button next to the chapters for download, or you can go straight to the crowdfunding campaign.  “Several years ago I came across the original publication and thought what an excellent resource it is for villages and teachers of permaculture. It’s strength lies in the number of strategies and techniques it offer practitioners. The book is easy to handle and well indexed. The drawings are clear and represent a reality for readers. It is especially valuable in being available in several languages. I introduced it to a permaculture design class in East Timor and the students were excited to have information of such good quality. The book’s potential is beyond the islands of SE Asia. For example I had some chapters of the book translated into Luganda in Uganda and it was immediately swallowed up by keen students and we could have printed many many copies. Having taught in so many tropical countries with their range of ecosystems, it is evident that the guidebook needs wider dissemination around the equatorial regions. All equatorial east and west Africa, and then there is South America. One of the problems in disseminating permaculture information is lack of suitable and relevant resources particularly for the tropic regions. I hope the present book will be revised, updated and made available to students and farmers to meet a need for their will and right to know, and render their lives more sustainable and productive.”    Rowe Morrow is the author of several books for permaculture students and teachers.

"My two year student/mentor relationship with Bill from late  was certainly the defining relationship that set the course for the rest of my life. The article ‘A Chance Meeting’ (below) recalled that pivotal moment when I first met Bill and effectively selected him as ‘the teacher’. Bill’s brilliance was in gathering together the ecological insights, principles, strategies and techniques that could be applied to create the world we do want rather than fighting against the world we reject. His personal life was as tumultuous as his public persona, at times tragic but always full of the passion and contradiction that the term ‘ecological warrior’ represents. His legacy lives on in all those who were transformed by his teaching. This tribute by leading British permaculture teacher, Graham Bell, provides an excellent overview of his life including his confronting character.   A seminar “How Patterns of Land Tenure Shape the Exploitation of Natural Resources” sounded mildly interesting. I wondered whether our household efforts at self sufficient living in a rented house with a friendly and helpful landlady might be a relevant example. Most young people seemed to think it was really weird putting so much work into building up the soil and improving the garden, when we didn’t own the house. Well it wasn’t the landlady that was cutting short my tenure. The shared house thing was starting to go sour with John and Sue. They obviously wanted their own space, as a couple with their baby. It was time to move on. But what a pain – with the garden planted and only a month to go before flying back to Western Australia for end year holidays. The seminar, and most of the contributions from the usual participants seemed fairly predictable but there was this guy from the Uni** whose contribution caught my attention. He talked about how rabbit trappers could have controlled rabbits (prior to Myxomatosis) if they had the incentive through a stake in the land (owned by the graziers or the state). Don’t think anyone saw the relevance to the topic (I hadn’t mentioned our insignificant efforts at suburban self sufficiency in a rented property). The discussion meandered back to how urban planning controls could or couldn’t shape urban structure and therefore resource use. Afterwards I went over to speak to this bloke from the Uni. Some of the staff and older post grad students seemed to know him, but I had never seen him around E.D. before. He might have been late forties I supposed, stocky, balding slightly, beard covering protruding chin. Meaty hands and thick nicotine stained fingers; of a working man, I thought. I followed up on his idea; we talked on for ages about the rabbit problem and more. His way of thinking and expression were fascinating; grounded but at same time, holistic. Ecological! I thought, but not like any of the activists who called themselves ecologists, or the academically trained ones, who seemed just as reductionist as most scientists. We exhausted our time, then he asked about my arm being in a sling. A brief recount of the motorbike accident and needing to move out of Blackman’s Bay led to an offer to stay till the end of the school year at his place up Strickland Ave on the slopes of the mountain. Sounded ideal. His name was Bill Mollison. ‘A Chance Meeting‘ first appeared in the  Permaculture Diary , compiled by Michele Margolis. * Environmental Design department at College of Advance Education

"Originally published on the PacificEdge blog. WITHOUT DIRECTION we drift like a ship with a broken engine. With a sense of direction we move forward. But to have direction we have to know where we have come from. We have to know where we are going. The Permaculture Calendar has become a means of knowing that. It represents the temporal framework within which we plan our permaculture journey. The Calendar is the engine of our permaculture ship and it is not broken. Thanks to the work of Richard Telford, each year the Permaculture Calendar appears to document the work of some of the practitioners of this distributed network we call permaculture. In this review of next year’s calendar I want to look at two things: Having just written that subhead I realise I have accidentally borrowed it from the writer, Susan Sontag, who wrote a book with that title. But… onto the value of photography. The calendar demonstrates the value of photography in documenting this social movement of ours. It is no secret that the worldwide web has increased the importance of visual communications such as photography, however the use of calendars as visual media predates the web. Thus, the Calendar acknowledges the primacy of visual communication through photography and continues the tradition of the calendar as a medium for it. It discloses in colour the creativity in permaculture. Through the photography appearing in the Permaculture Calendar over the years of its existence we view a history, a visual story of this design system of ours. The Calendars become a visual story of our collective accomplishments, the works of individual permaculture practitioners and also that of the organisations they set up. We can look back and see what we have done and in doing that we start to get a sense of the continuity, the ongoing history of our design system. If we keep the permaculture calendars over the years we can flick through them and in doing so see our story, or part of it, in full colour. There are five photographs showing some aspect of gardening in the  calendar, one about a technology made by hand, another on the craft production of a utilitarian kitchen tool, one about food, one about building and one about recovery after natural disaster. February’s compost system that moves composting wastes downslope as they go through the composting process I know works because I have seen a similar system in use in a community garden. The material degrades as it is moved downslope but because it is not exposed to the heat that a compost heap produces it does not affect the propagation potential of seeds that might happen to be in it, nor does it complete the composting process. The experience of the community garden I mention was that the partially-degraded material needs to be accumulated into a compost bin or system after being moved downslope. Here, it is exposed to the heat build-up that completes the process and allows the material to cure. April’s image of food storage at a homestead, that avoids the use of electricity, shows the value of producing and storing surplus, though such a low-energy lifeway is available only to the few. There is nothing wrong with homesteading, of course, but modern lifeways militate against it. Despite this, in the best tradition of permaculture people manoeuvre around the problem to adopt some of the elements of the homesteading lifestyle. My partner, for example, preserves fruit and other foods using Fowlers Vacola tech even though we live in a small apartment. Likewise, busy urban working people with no time to make bread the traditional way find a solution in technology with their own electronic breadbot, a bread making machine. Although this domestic automation of the breadmaking process might not appeal to traditionalist home bakers who roll, pummel and knead their bread dough, the breadbot offers home bakers a high degree of control over what goes into their food. Food production in the home garden, where that is available, is another possibility although there is much to be said (and Bill Mollison said it) for buying your food from someone who has produced it responsibly through a food co-op, CSA (community supported agriculture) or the hybrid-CSAs/food hubs we have in the big cities. In so doing we contribute more to building the regional food economy than home growing does. “We can also begin to take some part in food production. This doesn’t mean that we all need to grow our own potatoes, but it may mean that we will buy them directly from a person who is already growing potatoes responsibly. In fact, one would probably do better to organize a farmer-purchasing group in the neighborhood than to grow potatoes.”
…Bill Mollison. October’s wheel of ecological culture I find a somewhat contradictory concept. At one point on the wheel it states ‘technology backgrounded’. Yet, a little further on it states ‘energy powerdown — renewables’. Why the contradiction? Because renewable energy systems are hi-tech, they use new types of materials and computerised, automatic control and distribution systems. If we want a society powered by renewables if follows that we want hi-tech. For the most part the wheel is fine as a conceptual map of what its producers see as valuable in an emergent, resilient culture. March’s image appeals to me most of all, perhaps. Not because it is astounding in any photographic sense but because of what it shows — a scaling-up of permaculture ideas in the city to produce food in bulk. We realise this is already happening when we think of Hobart City Farm, Wagtail Urban Farm in Adelaide and the new Pocket City Farm in inner urban Sydney. These are small urban market gardens producing fresh food on a commercial scale. They are important not only because they enact Bill Mollison’s dictum of returning food production to the city, but because they create livelihoods in the new economy. We know that the new economy emerges from the old, it uses the materials, the fuels, the knowledge of the old to create and build the production capacity, the tools, the technologies, the organisational forms of what will replace it. Small scale, intensively managed farmlets in the city like that in March’s photograph are one of those new systems visible in the old and they scale-up backyard and community garden food production and make it available to more people. Images in the  calendar raise a philosophical question about permaculture. Looking through next year’s calendar I find the  photographs a celebration of gardens, food and the handicraft approach to life. All of this is good and all of those skills valuable, however it comes across as being about past values from, as some might see it, the Nineteenth Century being transposed into the Twenty First. Someone, and I don’t recall who, once said that there is a lot of nostalgia in permaculture. They meant nostalgia for those past times, for the era of manual labour, for the handicraft approach to the provision of our needs. Those skills are still useful for those with the wherewithal and time to practice them. What is absent in the Calendar are images of people interacting with modern technology, yet so many permaculture people I know interact with it every day, making modern tech as much about permaculture as the craft technologies. Let’s stop talking about photography and the philosophy of permaculture for a moment to consider the man who produces this calendar. Richard Telford. It is through Richard’s gift of good graphic design that we have the calendar. And through his persistence in producing a new edition year after year. Richard’s work amply demonstrates how publishing, photography and writing — all fall within the ‘invisible systems’ of permaculture — are as much permaculture skills as are growing cabbages or building a small house. Those are the skills through which we, as a social movement, get to know ourself. Without the skill of the photographer, permaculture journalist, author and publisher permaculture would remain ignorant of its challenges, its achievements, its story. It would have no story, no history. The Permaculture Calendar  brings us a visual continuity of that history. So, here we are. … a new permaculture Calendar for a new year. A calendar that through the practice of photography records this design system that we inhabit and in doing so provides us with that sense of continuity I mentioned earlier. But… Richard’s producing the Permaculture Calendar  is only part of the story. Someone has to buy it this year if we want another calendar next year. Buying the Permaculture Calendar  is a vote with our dollar for Richard to produce more editions. Our purchase money is the energy those future editions run on. Our purchase is a way to encourage Richard to produce the calendar over coming years. What better Christmas gift could there be to remind those receiving it of permaculture’s accomplishments, month after month. We don’t actually need Christmas, however, for the calendar offers a way to say thank you to someone who has done us a favour, who has helped us out or whose work we value. It is recognition of another’s value in print form. In giving the calendar we give those receiving it the idea that there are other ways of doing things, there are alternative futures.

Sunrise Farm in Rani Patati village near Kathmandu, is a community farm owned & managed by Mr Shyam Shrestha & his family. It is a working farm, established in , offering demonstration, training and seed & seedling distribution facilities. The farm also runs a program committed to the demonstration and training of sustainable agriculture and community development techniques and approaches Various foods and resources are grown & harvested including roots, grain, leaf, fruit & flower crops from trees, shrubs, grasses and herbs plus firewood, animal fodder and mulch. Crops are protected by integrated pest management strategies, encouraged by microclimate creation and use, etc Immediately after the earthquakes, hundreds of people descended on the farm’s land in order to be away from large buildings that were collapsing all around. The farmhouse was structurally damaged and unsafe and the barn was totally destroyed. Many people, sheltered under hastily constructed plastic tarps, including the Shrestha family. They cooked for dozens of refugees for  days until emergency services, water & electricity reached the area. They continued catering for their community for some weeks, using the farm’s abundant vegetables and grains grown in the organic no-till beds.  Following a crowd funding appeal, donations and a micro-grant from Permafund, work to rebuild Sunrise Farm started in November . However, at the start it was affected by the embargo on Nepal by India that ran from September  until January . Commodities became unavailable or at best, prohibitively expensive, as fuel became rare. Again, while the city starved of cooking gas, forests around the valley began to be stripped. Sunrise Farm was able to cook on its ageing biogas unit fueled by recycled manure plus biomass, supplemented by firewood from the agroforestry section of the farm. This delay time was used for planning & research of the best methods of re-building. As funds accrued, work started in December with de-construction of damaged areas of the house and barn and recycling of the materials. The house build involved jacking up existing concrete beams and strengthening them with new and stronger beams, infilling with traditional brickwork using partially recycled bricks from the demolished walls and partially stabilised compressed earth bricks (SCEBs). The SCEBs were manufactured using a hydraulic ram made in Nepal with an earth and % cement mix. They were not fired. The house has now been completely restored, except for plastering and painting. This will be done in the Autumn (Spring in Southern Hemisphere) of , following a planned training course in lime plastering. Meanwhile work has started on the barn. Sunrise Farm was fortunate to meet International Disaster Volunteers (IDV) with whom they struck up a partnership and who provided an architect and constant stream of volunteers to help the Sunrise Farm family. The barn was built using a combination of SCEBs, stone & mud mortar plus bamboo (both as structural beams and woven as wall fabric), with a corrugated tin and Perspex roof for extra light. Like the house, the barn is complete except for pleasuring and painting. Currently the family is constructing the new training hall. International Disaster Volunteers are helping with this too. The aim is to have this complete, or at least covered, before the monsoon sets in. Sunrise Farm has already begun to host training and demonstration projects thanks to the help of the crowd funding and donations. Permaculture diploma induction events and farmers’ field trip visits will be included. Permafund have provided a micro-grant to support this project, as well as supporting other permaculture projects around the world. Donations of $. or more to Permaculture Australia’s Permafund (Permaculture International Public Fund) are tax deductible in Australia.

Isabella Guerrini, at the University of Perugia in Italy, works in the department of agriculture studying plant and animal consciousness and its integration into ecological pattern and rhythm. Her observations of sap flow in plants confirm that, indeed, fluid flows more full as the moon becomes full, slowing down as the moon wanes. This, she explains, has important consequences for plant growth and pruning: vigorous, sappy plants will suffer if cut, harvested, or pruned close to the full moon. First off, leaking sap exposes the plant to disease and pest incursion. But furthermore, sap from a cut plant, now deprived of its primary outlet, will engorge smaller channels, where new buds are developing on side branches, and potentially rupture those channels leading to the death of the buds (a phenomenon known as “lunar burn”, because it was so often noted around the full moon). Less vigorous, less juicy plants, like ground-covers or vines, conversely may benefit from being cut when sap flow is strong: it will stimulate the development of side shoots and encourage fuller, branching growth. Those who work with plants every day have certainly noticed differences in moisture content, flavor (meaning chemistry), and more. This can have important consequences across a range of applications, from medicine to construction. For an excellent review of the subject, see Ian Cole and Michael Balick’s review article. The authors discuss a range of traditional practices related to moon phase, from the harvesting of construction and thatch materials, to the planting of staple crops, to the gathering of medicines. In their review of some contemporary research, they catalog differences in plant chemistry and fluid balance based on seasonal and circadian (day-long) rhythms, but note that studies that examine lunar rhythms are still few and far between. In my personal experimentation, I concur that flavor and phytochemical variation is most noticeable as part of a seasonal cycle, but moisture content (once variables such as rainfall are accounted for) is very closely tied to lunar cycles. Water weight in a botanical sample can vary up to % between the days just before the full moon and the week before the new moon. This parallels what researchers have found in lumber: wood from spruce and chestnut, harvested in the last week of the moon phase, has the lowest water percentage and shrinks the least during drying. It is rumored that the wooden stilts upon which Venice was built all were harvested during the last few days of the moon cycle: less water and denser fibers means less susceptibility to rotting and parasites. Ernst Zürcher, who published the research on lumber harvesting, expanded on Cole and Balick’s work, cataloging the changes in moisture content, as well as effects on plant germination, growth, and development in many different plants as relates to lunar cycles. The conclusions are consistent: there is indeed a lunar effect. But he also points out that the easy explanation (a tide-like gravitational force) is most likely incorrect, as the amount of water in even the largest tree is relatively small, and a tidal force would be negligible. An intriguing hypothesis is that moonlight itself may contribute to electromagnetic effects that alter the surface tension of water, allowing for some of the microscopic effects that have been experimentally documented. All plants grow differently during different phases of the moon—this has been observed in scientific research since the s and, more recently, documented on the microscopic level by observing changes in rootlet growth. But as to why—this question is still unresolved. What we do know is that moonlight, while generally similar to the sunlight it reflects, shifts a bit towards the infrared (see above spectral graph, from CIRA, at Colorado State University) and also has some gaps that may be linked to the presence of traces of sodium in the lunar “atmosphere”. This makes moonlight not just a less intense version of sunlight—it is somewhat qualitatively different, too. Dr. Guerrini has speculated that the rhythmic, additional irradiation from moonlight is an important adjunct to the growth and metabolism of healthy plants: not only have we seen change in growth and leaf movements, but also in patterns of starch storage (highest in the waning phase) and utilization (highest in the days before the full moon). These effects, along with preliminary documentation of immune deficiency and poor wound healing from moonlight-deprived plants, encourage us to think of moonlight as an important part of a plant’s overall “nutrition”. Interestingly, this “nutrition” seems to be more a modulation of bio-electric activity rather than a source of photosynthetic energy. In conclusion, moonlight is subtle—typically, even at its peak, only about % as strong as sunlight. But its rays penetrate the soil, and affect plant life from germination to harvest. Most plants seem to need a rhythmic exposure to moonlight—at least for a week or so around the full moon—for optimal immunity, wound healing, regeneration, and growth. Plant harvesting should ideally heed the lunar cycle, not simply for potency and low water content, but because many plants (especially strong, vigorous growers) recover better when they are harvested during the last week of the lunar cycle. It seems that the subtle effects of moonlight can alter the way water behaves as it interfaces with living cells, perhaps through bio-electric mechanisms. As the old myths tell us, the moon is a powerful force, regulating the unseen, yin-like processes hidden under the surfaces of things, deeply connected to water and moisture. Easy explanations of its effects can often be misdirection – the moon may seem to lay out a trail for us, but this trail often leads to places we’d never expect. But just as tidal forces served to shape early life on our planet, the more hidden effects we are just starting to understand may be essential to maintain healthy life on earth today.  While the factors that affect plant growth are complex and vary greatly, the basic concept is really quite simple. As the moon increases in light towards the full moon, sap flow is more active. Conversely, as the moon wanes, sap flow slows.

At the turn of the st century the evidence for energy descent driven by peak oil and climate change was already strong. The quasi religious belief in continuous economic growth had a strong hold on collective psychology in central Victoria as much as anywhere in the world. The global financial system began to unravel in  at the same time that global production of conventional oil peaked. For a minority it was increasingly obvious that the policies put in place ensured that the collapse was even more severe when it did come. It was like the powers that be had pushed the accelerator hard to the floor in one of those supercharged sports cars of the time, to attempt to jump across the widening chasm that humanity was facing. The collapse of global financial growth unfolded differently in different places but here the story had many upsides that were partly due to luck and partly a result of visionaries and innovators who helped create a better future. These are the bare bones of how we got from what a few people still consider was the golden age to what we call the Earth Steward culture. In  the Australian property bubble burst. For our communities, this marked the start of the First Energy Descent Crisis (of the st century). Ballarat Bank was the first financial institution to fail and a government forced take over by the Commonwealth Bank saw the Community Bank network hived off as local lending co-ops backed by local government hoping to restart economic activity in regional towns that were increasingly on their own as State and Federal governments focused on dealing with hardship and social unrest in the cities. The crisis was world wide, so dramatically reduced global Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the peak of global oil (what they called Total Liquids at the time) the same year was very much in line with the  Limits To Growth report default scenario showing industrial output peaking about that time. More recent studies suggest that net energy available to support humanity peaked closer to the turn of the millennium but it’s all a moot point because it seems that economic growth had been a net drain on human welfare for decades before that. As capital investment in oil fell off a cliff, and production from existing fields declined at nearly % there was a second oil price shock, a US currency collapse and a short war between the USA and China in . Australia got punished in the trade embargo imposed by China. The economic crisis in China had already caused nearly  million of the recently urbanised workers to return to the villages, and reimposition of a command economy to continue the shift to renewable energy and revitalise agriculture. Consequently China was able to cope without Australian coal and gas and there was so much scrap steel in the world that the iron ore exports had come to a standstill. While oil and food remained costly (at least relative to falling wages) most manufactured goods were dirt-cheap. Solar panels from China (somehow getting around the trade embargo) accelerated the trend for retail customers going off grid which, combined with collapse of commercial demand for electricity, led to a “Death Spiral” in the power grid with rising prices and increasing blackouts (and surges due to excess wind and solar inputs). A newly elected Federal Labor government renationalised the power grid, along with price controls, rationing an Australia ID card allowing rationed access to subsidised supermarkets that had been experiencing shortages of fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy. In Victoria, a Liberal government implemented policies to encourage people to be more self-reliant. Permaculture education was adopted as a framework for integrating aspects of self-reliance including home food production, owner building, water harvesting and waste management. Rationing of fuel led to hitch-hiking, ride sharing and in rural areas a rush to convert vehicles to wood gas. Bicycles became the default personal transport around town in Castlemanine but in Daylesford and Hepburn, electric bikes and vehicles powered by the Hepburn Wind charging stations installed for tourists before the property bubble burst maintained mobility for locals. Conversion of vehicles to wood gas by a range of bush mechanics and ex-hot rodders had mixed success. The market value of higher powered larger vehicles and trucks rose as a result of the first wave of conversions. The Castlemaine Obtainium Engineering Institute was established to test and improve local designs and prototypes. One of the motivations was a competitive spirit with the electric car networks centred in Daylesford and Ballarat. Use of Bitcoin (a virtual currency), local currencies, precious metals and barter all increased to support exchange in the rapidly growing informal and grey economies. Bitcoin then failed in mysterious circumstances after being targeted for funding terrorism. The Internet began functioning again after major breakdowns during the conflict between the US and China. But Facebook and Amazon were bankrupt, cyberspace was littered with defunct and unmaintained sites and Internet marketing was plagued by cyber crime and draconian government regulations. Local computer networks using wireless technology, as well as a revival of two-way radio, started building back to basics communication pathways.;Permaculture Principles
We are always on the lookout for images to help give a wider interpretation of how the design principles can be applied. All of the images used on the principle pages have been included in previous Permaculture Calendars, which is now in it’s th incarnation. This website has been designed as a starting point for people who are interested in exploring what permaculture is all about, as well as a place where practitioners can get a better sense of how the principles can be applied. It’s an ideal spot to expose projects that demonstrate permaculture thinking to the hundreds of thousands of people that visit the site each year, as well as the many thousands more who see the calendar up in people homes and offices.  From previous experience it’s good to set yourself an exercise of taking a photo to illustrate a particular principle. This could be a good exercise for permaculture teachers to set students, or a local permaculture group? Permaculture Northern Beaches in Sydney ran a photo competition with the ‘Stalled by the Roadside’ image selected for the  calendar. If you think that you may have something, point me to your online photo library or email me your images and I’ll let you know if there is a possibility or two. Photos with people and/or animals in them tend to fare well as they help bring images to life. I’m after photos (or illustrations) in landscape format that are high resolution jpeg files (around  x  pixels), so that they can be printed at over A size. Email your submissions to [email protected] before the th of June . If your image is selected as the cover for the Permaculture Calendar you’ll receive twelve copies, a further eleven selections will receive four copies along with links and credits – a small token of thanks for successful contributions. Think of the exposure it will bring to your project. For inspiration, check out the collection on each of the design principle pages. Happy snapping! Richard Telford ;Permaculture Principles
"This is a bittersweet farewell and celebration as we say hoo-roo to the Permaculture Principles calendar after  years.  years! That’s  months of appreciation for permaculture projects around the world, and nearly  days of permaculture having pride of place on walls everywhere. We’ve contributed over $,AU to support permaculture projects and change makers too – something we’re proud to reflect upon. As anyone with a wall calendar will attest, those little daily boxes become the custodians of all kinds of precious information; plantings, gatherings, rainfall, heatwaves, loved one’s birthdays, moods, homesteading to-dos and the occasional absentminded work of art. It has been a joy to create each calendar knowing that thousands of people are sharing the same daily experience, noticing and capturing the small, vital stuff of life. And long after each calendar “expires”, it lives on as a treasured time capsule; a ledger of all your legendary permaculture antics – we know that many of these calendars will be in use for years to come. There are still two months to enjoy, but we do realise that many people are getting organised and looking for a calendar to take them into . It won’t be ours, we are sorry to say… but hey, it has been wonderful! Massive thanks to the Permaculture Calendar team who have brought it all together, including the original designers David Arnold and Richard Telford.

"In the hills east of Canberra, down a dusty lane that passes racehorses dozing in thick phalaris, and wild apple trees and thickets of plum and hawthorn, then winds up the Lake George escarpment through Yellow Box woodland full of finches, thornbills, cuckoo-shrikes, kookaburras and robins, there’s a rusty old gate with a stencilled sign that says “Millpost”. The heritage of our farm is long, complex and rich; challenging to protect in a time of climatic and economic uncertainty. As custodians for thirty-nine years, our family has endeavoured to preserve and enrich this landscape, while earning enough from the land to enjoy the privilege of maintaining stewardship. Permaculture Principle #: Obtain a Yield In January  David and I attended the first-ever PDC at Stanley, Tasmania with Bill Mollison. The insights we gained have guided our decision-making ever since. Minimising food miles, creating stability through diversity, turning problems into assets, zero waste, small-scale and local solutions…these have been our bywords. Millpost was windswept and degraded when David first arrived in . Since then, we’ve planted or direct-seeded approximately  kilometres of native windbreaks using Eucalyptus, Acacia, Bursaria, Callistemon and Casuarinas. Sheep are excluded from about  hectares, including riparian zones, to allow natural regeneration. Stock and wildlife alike benefit from shade and shelter in every paddock. Big increases in bird populations ( sp.) mean improved natural pest control. But it’s not all good news; the resulting increase in kangaroo numbers threatens our viability. Deciduous trees such as poplar, willow, oak, ash, honey locust and black locust are planted strategically to provide fire protection for the homestead complex, as well as stock fodder, shade and food (fruit and nuts). If they sucker, all the better! Both native and exotic trees are harvested for timber (building and fence posts) and firewood (heating and cooking). By harvesting water from shed roofs uphill from dwellings, we use the Permaculture strategy of storing water at the highest possible point and using gravity to move it, rather than relying on pumps. We also place dams as high as possible in the landscape to enable gravity-feeding of water for stock or gardens. Principle #:Catch and Store Energy. David Holmgren created a Whole Farm Plan for us in . We are gradually implementing the design, moving from  large paddocks back in the s to about  today, which we subdivide further with portable electric fencing. The new paddocks allow us to spell over % of the farm at any one time and to keep the sheep out of wet areas when necessary. Our main challenge has been making a living from a relatively infertile farm, especially in frequent severe droughts. Our Permaculture system allowed us to survive low wool prices and other adversities because producing our own food (vegies, fruit, meat, eggs and dairy produce) has lowered our cost of living. Today’s challenge is to provide a livelihood here for our children and their families. We hope our diversification venture, Millpost Merino knitting yarn, will help our family farm survive. Principle #: Integrate Rather than Segregate Our native pastures (more than % of the farm) are botanically diverse and yield well even in drought. Principle #: Use and Value Diversity Bill Mollison told us the difference between conventional farmers and Permaculturists was that the former looked at the land and asked: how can this land be made to produce dollars? Whereas the latter asked: what does it (nature) offer? Principle #: Observe and Interact Merino wool is the finest, softest wool in the world as a result of centuries of careful breeding programmes. Merino sheep can withstand climatic extremes and still produce this robust yet soft, multi-functional fibre for making clothing that can last a lifetime. We are taking the Stewardship approach to our wool enterprise, by protecting and enhancing the endangered temperate native grasslands (including Grassy Yellow Box Woodlands) that make up much of the  hectares of Millpost farm. Sheep are a regenerative tool: they graze pasture hard for short periods then move on to a fresh paddock, allowing grasslands enough time to recover between grazing events. Depending on seasonal conditions, paddocks may be grazed briefly only two or three times per year. We are starting small, with only the very best of our fine wool clip (three bales) being processed for yarn. Principle #: Use Small and Slow Solutions  David’s book Millpost: a broadscale permaculture farm since  is available from our Australian webstore or from the yarn website millpostmerino.com.au";Permaculture Principles
 I discovered the magic of gardening at an early age, looking after Dad’s herbs at home. As a keen cook, he kept quite a collection. There must have been thirty different varieties with each one growing in an individual terracotta pot, neatly lined up in rows on a tiered planter shelf. It was my job to keep them in top shape. Hand watering was a daily task in Perth’s hot, dry summer. Regular feeding to keep the growth soft and palatable, and occasional re-potting, division and replanting – all simple tasks that made a big impact on me. These were the first things that I nurtured and the result of these efforts ended up in our dinner most evenings. My next garden project was a bit more ambitious. At fourteen I set up a four-square-metre ‘no-dig’ vegie patch on top of the lawn in our backyard. I was fascinated by how a few bales of straw, a load of compost and a handful of seeds could be converted into bundles of fresh vegetables within a matter of months. I often tell people that growing food is highly infectious. Once you make a start the sense of satisfaction and reward is overwhelming. I can still vividly recall the moment when it really hit me. It was late one warm afternoon and I had been working in my little patch, which by this stage had expanded to include a number of large tubs filled with tomatoes and climbing beans trailing along the fence. I sat on the lawn, leaning back against the warm red brick wall of our shed and basked in the contentment and satisfaction with what I had created. From that point on I’ve considered myself a gardener. Dad picked up on my new fascination with gardening. As a keen book collector he was thrilled to see me fossicking in second hand book shops as I slowly developed a collection of my own. One evening he gave me two books that he had bought years before and tucked away in a forgotten section of his library. They were first edition copies of Permaculture One and Permaculture Two. They made immediate sense to me. The ideas were logical, the principles were practical and the ethical basis underpinning it all was fair and just. The more I read, the more I started to question things, especially life in a comfortable suburb, living in high energy, wasteful homes, surrounded by high maintenance unproductive landscapes. It was all wrong. Clearly there must be a better way to do it. I realised that I needed to learn more about the natural world and the way that it worked. This realisation influenced my subject selection in high school and eventually led me to study environmental science at university, but it was always the practical aspects of permaculture that kept me inspired. My interest in permaculture got a major boost at the age of nineteen when I stumbled across a neglected suburban block with potential. It was a classic run down rental property that still retained the features typical to the original s homes in the area. There were old fruit trees, a hen shed, a dilapidated glass house and a workshop. There were remnant native species that, given their age, would have pre-dated the development of the area. It was like a time capsule. All around it, time had moved on. Dalkeith was now a prestigious riverside address noted for its leafy gardens and proximity to private schools. Meanwhile number  Circe Circle was still like something out of the BBC classic The Good Life. My brother was renting the place with his mates. The first time I visited I thought to myself, “I’ve got to get this place!” Timing was on my side and it wasn’t long before he moved out and I moved in. And so began my first serious garden project. Being my first rental property, I wasn’t exactly sure of what the rules were when it came to working in the garden. The place was a complete mess so I assumed that any work tidying up was bound to be appreciated. I started off tentatively. I was busy studying at university and was also running a part-time local gardening round, so my early efforts were mainly limited to exploring the various nooks and crannies of the block. Each session was like an archaeological dig. The more things I’d discovered including old tools and forgotten pathways, the more intrigued I became with the garden. It wasn’t long before I decided the best thing to do was to drop down to part-time study and take this project more seriously. Whether it was my growing passion for gardening or an avoidance strategy for chemistry and statistics is beside the point – it was the best thing I ever did. Over the next six years, my housemates and I rejuvenated the property and created a remarkable garden that combined friendship, learning, fun with a real feeling of independence and self-reliance. We pulled the lawn up, repaired the glasshouse, repaired the sheds, installed a rainwater tank and set up trellises for growing fruit trees and vines. We built new pens for ducks and aviaries for pigeons and quail. We experimented with solar ovens and composting toilets, brewed beer and baked bread. It was brilliant. Being poor students we learnt how to be resourceful with salvaged materials and created a space with rambling pathways, extended poultry runs, homemade garden seats, worm farms and compost bays. We basically overhauled the place and it wasn’t long until I actually felt as if the property was ours. What we did buy, we bought locally. There was a small group of shops around the corner called the ‘Dalkeith Village’ which had been there (in more humble form) since the suburb began in the s. There was a bakery, a little supermarket, a bottle shop, a nursery and even a small father-son owned hardware store where you could still buy individual nails. Of course they charged like a wounded bull, earning the proprietor the nickname ‘Old Man Fleece’ amongst my housemates, but that didn’t really matter. It was more important for us to know that we were supporting local businesses, which provided the convenience, comfort and security that we had what we needed near by. In time we struck up great relationships with our elderly neighbours. Most had been there for some forty plus years and remembered a time when everyone had fruit trees and chooks in their backyard. I’m sure that they thought we were odd to start with, but when they realised we were really having a go, their interest grew. It wasn’t long before I was passing eggs and homegrown produce over the fence. In return they would make jams, give tips on the best local plant varieties and dear old Mrs James up the back would throw her scraps over for our chooks. There was a real sense of community. My friends were also fascinated. When people visited they’d head straight for the chooks. At night I’d give tours by torchlight to explore the jungle like garden and spot frogs. Being born in the mid s, we were part of a generation that didn’t automatically connect with gardening and self-reliance. Perhaps that was part of the buzz for me, in that we were doing something different – something inherently practical and something that just made sense. In , the th International Permaculture Conference (IPC) was to be held in Perth, and with it a special Permaculture Design Course (PDC) was to be run involving a number of respected WA permaculturists as guest teachers. I’d been planning to do my PDC for a while, but as a student, time and cost were always an issue. Attending IPC was an opportunity too good to miss. I deferred from university for a semester, cranked up the gardening round to save up some money and registered for the design course and conference. By this stage, I was confident with many of the practical aspects of permaculture from the hands-on skills that I had developed in my backyard and on my gardening round, but I was eager to explore new concepts in design and relate them to my academic studies. The PDC, conference and site tours that followed certainly provided this and made me realise that it was time to leave the comfort of my backyard and neighbourhood and expand my skill set by working on other projects. As always an opportunity soon presented itself. One of the site tours we took during the PDC was to the Environmental Technology Centre at Murdoch University (the university where I was studying). It was a fascinating project which had been set up as a research and development facility to explore the applications of small-scale environmental technologies in the areas of water supply, sanitation, energy, shelter, and food production. The research group’s main focus at the time was the application of appropriate technologies for improved environmental health in remote indigenous communities, however they had also fostered an active local community group to help with the development of the .-hectare site. It was just what I was looking for – a fresh, practical learning environment at an exciting scale to develop new skills. The infrastructure was impressive including solar powered bores, a hybrid (wind and solar) remote area power system, composting toilets and a range of wastewater reuse systems. There were demonstration buildings made from strawbale and mud brick, and the beginnings of a productive landscape including aquaculture ponds, food forest and vegetable gardens. I signed up as a volunteer and was soon spending most of my time there. My home garden was established and thriving and I was enjoying putting my energies into something different. Before long I was employed as site coordinator and spent the next five years managing the ongoing design and development of the site whilst completing my undergraduate degree. Like many good projects we were under-funded financially but were able to achieve a great deal due to the commitment of staff, students and community volunteers. There was a strong shared vision for the importance of demonstrating low impact ways of living and increasing self-reliance. We ran Work for the Dole programs, hosted Corrective Services participants and kept the doors open for anyone who wanted to participate or learn about permaculture. Alongside my site work, I was extremely fortunate to be mentored through a broad range of academic experiences. It was a unique situation where I was expected to teach, present at conferences and undertake field work around WA, all before graduating. This was possible thanks to a progressive group of academics who saw the value in practical experience, recognised passion and provided me with the opportunities to grow.

We are on the lookout for images to help give a wider interpretation of how the design principles can be applied. All of the images used on the principle pages have been included in previous Permaculture Calendars. This website has been designed as a starting point for people who are interested in exploring what permaculture is all about, as well as a place where practitioners can get a better sense of how the principles can be applied. It’s an ideal spot to expose projects that demonstrate permaculture thinking to the hundreds of thousands of people that visit the site each year, as well as the many thousands more who see the calendar up in people homes and offices. Use the #permacultureprinciples on Instagram to make sure we, and everyone else, sees your image. If you like an image, make sure you let the photographer know. You can also use the #tag for the specific principle, for example #observeandinteract (principle name no spaces) if you think that the photo would work best to illustrate that principle. See our Instagram page for more examples. From previous experience it’s good to set yourself an exercise of taking a photo to illustrate a particular principle. This could be a good exercise for permaculture teachers to set students, or a local permaculture group? If you think that you may have something, point me to your online photo library or email me your images and I’ll let you know if there is a possibility or two. Photos with people and/or animals in them tend to fare well as they help bring images to life. I’m after photos (or illustrations) in landscape format that are high resolution jpeg files (around  x  pixels), so that they can be printed at over A size. Email your submissions to [email protected] before the th of April . If your image is selected as the cover for the Permaculture Calendar you’ll receive twelve copies, a further eleven selections will receive four copies along with links and credits – a small token of thanks for successful contributions. Think of the exposure it will bring to your project.

"Rocket stove combustion systems deserve attention for a few reasons: That’s right – you can build these systems in a day or two, and then watch them turn twigs into heat far more efficiently than most wood stoves, with far less set-up cost. If you are good at scavenging bits they can cost virtually nothing to build, and when you prune your fruit trees you can get the fuel you need to cook dinner, heat your home, and enjoy a nice hot shower. The main difference between a normal fireplace or woodstove and a rocket stove is that rocket combustion is close to complete. When wood is burned it releases volatile compounds that we recognise as smoke or soot or creosote. In a rocket stove these compounds are sucked into the insulated and very hot ‘burn tunnel’ of the unit where they combust, releasing even more heat energy to drive the rocket process, unlike a normal fire where they are blown out the chimney. This distinctive sucking of the flames down into the burn tunnel, and the resultant ‘roar’ is what gives rocket stoves their name. This is also a part of their magic. Rocket stoves are open where the wood is fed in, allowing lots of oxygen to be drawn into the unit. As the fire starts, and the burn tunnel heats up, the rising hot air races up the heat riser, drawing lots of air behind it. This incoming air flows into the feed tube and across the burning wood – creating the same effect as pointing a big air-blower at your fire. It gets really hot, the wood burns beautifully, and you hear the air roaring as it charges through the system. In conventional wood stoves the air intake is small, and adjustable to even smaller. This lack of oxygen chokes the combustion, leading to cool burns, incomplete combustion and lots of smoke and creosote. When combustion is complete, what comes out the chimney is pretty much only carbon dioxide, meaning no smoke: smoke means incomplete combustion, unburned fuel, or wasted energy. We are culturally trained to associate smoke with fire; but with rocket stoves, sometimes when there is no smoke, there is still fire! Having ensured complete combustion, and hence maximum heat generation, only then do we think about using the resultant heat. Conventional wood stoves are sucking heat away from the combustion chamber for cooking, space heating or with ‘wet back’ water heaters, meaning the unit just can’t get hot enough for combustion to be complete, resulting in smoke. The combustion chamber of the rocket stove is heavily insulated to prevent premature heat loss, and an enormous amount of heat is generated by the efficient combustion process. When combustion is complete, we can extract heat from the stove at the top of the heat riser. And here is where your imagination and inner inventor can run wild: anything you can think to do with very hot air can be done from this point. Here are a few things that can be powered with a rocket stove. Take care! A well-built rocket stove can work so well it can be dangerous. Dan’s rocket oven once got to  °C in six minutes,  °C in seven minutes, and  °C in thirteen minutes! As for Joel’s latest rocket oven, on his first test run the whole inner skin of the feed tube was glowing red, as was the bottom of the inside of the oven: the thermometer read  °C, and the roast vegies were pretty charred (he has since tamed it down to  °C). While quite popular in some parts of the world, rocket stoves are a relatively rare sight in Australian permaculture systems. They are an excellent example of an appropriate technology alternative to conventional means of heating food, water or space; and they are well worth finding out more about.

 That is the motivation behind our new book, The Art of Frugal Hedonism: A Guide to Spending less While Enjoying Everything More. We coined the phrase ‘frugal hedonist’, to refer to someone who greedily laps up all of life’s non-monetised pleasures, whilst keeping themselves free enough to enjoy these pleasures by under-indulging in ‘comfort and convenience’ spending. Less money spent, equals less pressure to work, equals more flexibility to do the things that make you really happy! So familiar is the notion that consuming less is a sacrifice made for the sake of saving money or conserving resources, that it is easy to resent whatever we are giving up and overlook all the glorious side effects of a thriftier lifestyle. But take a step back, and the picture becomes clearer. While it might at first seem that spending less requires more effort, oversupply of consumables (of the level most modern first-worlders experience) actually has a tendency to turn right back into efforts that we need to expend. For example, the effort required to go to the gym/ weight loss support group/ doctor because you were oversupplied with cheap consumables and labour-saving devices. Not to mention the effort required to go to work to pay for those services. The Frugal Hedonist recognises the efficiency of a little restraint here and there, and the greater pleasures to be gained! Ride to the shops instead of driving, chop up that whopper pumpkin that you grew with an axe and make it into soup to take for lunch instead of buying takeaway, hang out your laundry because you’re too cheap to use a dryer, and base your holidays around hiking to waterfalls rather than eating at new cafes in different places, and the effort required to stay fit and healthy gets taken care of while you were doing other things. Marvellous. Another often-ignored side-effect of restricting our consumption is that it keeps us alive to appreciating the consumption we do do. Scoring an amazing cashmere jumper from a second hand store can only be fully relished by someone who doesn’t have a wardrobe already crammed with impulse buys from every shop in the mall. The pleasure of buying a mango from a street stall to eat messily on a summer’s afternoon park bench can only be as succulent to someone who doesn’t grab a chocolate bar every time they go through a supermarket checkout. Really having not enough is horrible: persistent hunger and cold make you unwell and stressed. Having just enough, plus a little more, is absolutely lovely. Having even more than that, just because it’s the cultural norm, starts to make you unwell and stressed all over again – although the connection is often less obvious. The problems of overabundance and ‘over-ease’ in Western cultures are hitting full stride in the form of our tight waistbands, overstuffed closets and overflowing rubbish tips. Let’s stop denying ourselves the full benefits of a connected, curious, materially-modest, sensually indulgent lifestyle. Let’s get Frugally Hedonistic. Annie Raser-Rowland The Art of Frugal Hedonism: A Guide to Spending less While Enjoying Everything More Annie and Adam have been life long frugalists who are not afraid to enjoy themselves in the process. Their quirky, and sometimes, confronting take on modern life is a welcome new direction in a world of over-abundance and abject poverty.

"Many of you may have heard about our project by now. Permatil (Permaculture Timor Leste), xpand Foundation and Disruptive Media have come together to produce the Tropical Permaculture Guidebook. Developed from the highly successful Permaculture Guidebook from Timor Leste published by Permatil in ; used by farmers, families, community groups, trainers, government departments, schools, universities, agricultural colleges and NGOs in Timor Leste, and re-used and translated in more than  countries. The guidebook is open source because that is the permaculture way, and with rapid change desperately needed, we need permaculture education and resources to spread as fast as possible. Across the globe it is clear that a big shift is starting to occur; towards small-scale intensive, organic, family owned agriculture systems. We can help accelerate this, and ensure that permaculture’s whole systems design approach is integrated as well. Enabling this change to occur requires farmers and families having access to the information, strategies and techniques they need. On top of this, climate change is already creating havoc with food production and water supplies, and vulnerable communities in the tropics are hardest hit. It will increase dramatically unless fast action is taken. Increasing soil and carbon content in the soil is perhaps the easiest and most important measure needed to reduce climate change. **  This guidebook tackles these fundamental issues on climate change, simultaneously providing permaculture’s solutions and creating community resilience. It turns theory into practical steps that anyone can take and use to affect positive change. All aspects of food production and living are covered, including a focus on agroecological, small-scale, organic food production, integrating crops and based on regenerating soil, water and the surrounding environment.  The new edition is a comprehensive up date; including hundreds of new illustrations, new chapters and techniques, with the content now generalised for all tropical countries. The easy to understand information can be used by readers of all economic and social backgrounds, and with over  detailed illustrations, it is especially useful for semi-literate and illiterate people. Once the English edition is complete, and when further funding is attained, translations to other languages including Spanish, French, Portuguese and national languages will commence. Follow us on Facebook at Tropical Permaculture Guidebook and you can also sign up to the email list to receive occasional updates regarding the progress of the guidebook, both online and printed editions. There are currently six chapters completed and available from www.permacultureguidebook.org with the other chapters being added as they are finished. If you are able to support the project by donating a small amount of money, it will help achieve the production goals and keep the guidebook free for those who can’t afford it. There is a donate button next to the chapters for download, or you can go straight to the crowdfunding campaign.  “Several years ago I came across the original publication and thought what an excellent resource it is for villages and teachers of permaculture. It’s strength lies in the number of strategies and techniques it offer practitioners. The book is easy to handle and well indexed. The drawings are clear and represent a reality for readers. It is especially valuable in being available in several languages. I introduced it to a permaculture design class in East Timor and the students were excited to have information of such good quality. The book’s potential is beyond the islands of SE Asia. For example I had some chapters of the book translated into Luganda in Uganda and it was immediately swallowed up by keen students and we could have printed many many copies. Having taught in so many tropical countries with their range of ecosystems, it is evident that the guidebook needs wider dissemination around the equatorial regions. All equatorial east and west Africa, and then there is South America. One of the problems in disseminating permaculture information is lack of suitable and relevant resources particularly for the tropic regions. I hope the present book will be revised, updated and made available to students and farmers to meet a need for their will and right to know, and render their lives more sustainable and productive.”    Rowe Morrow is the author of several books for permaculture students and teachers.

"My two year student/mentor relationship with Bill from late  was certainly the defining relationship that set the course for the rest of my life. The article ‘A Chance Meeting’ (below) recalled that pivotal moment when I first met Bill and effectively selected him as ‘the teacher’. Bill’s brilliance was in gathering together the ecological insights, principles, strategies and techniques that could be applied to create the world we do want rather than fighting against the world we reject. His personal life was as tumultuous as his public persona, at times tragic but always full of the passion and contradiction that the term ‘ecological warrior’ represents. His legacy lives on in all those who were transformed by his teaching. This tribute by leading British permaculture teacher, Graham Bell, provides an excellent overview of his life including his confronting character.   A seminar “How Patterns of Land Tenure Shape the Exploitation of Natural Resources” sounded mildly interesting. I wondered whether our household efforts at self sufficient living in a rented house with a friendly and helpful landlady might be a relevant example. Most young people seemed to think it was really weird putting so much work into building up the soil and improving the garden, when we didn’t own the house. Well it wasn’t the landlady that was cutting short my tenure. The shared house thing was starting to go sour with John and Sue. They obviously wanted their own space, as a couple with their baby. It was time to move on. But what a pain – with the garden planted and only a month to go before flying back to Western Australia for end year holidays. The seminar, and most of the contributions from the usual participants seemed fairly predictable but there was this guy from the Uni** whose contribution caught my attention. He talked about how rabbit trappers could have controlled rabbits (prior to Myxomatosis) if they had the incentive through a stake in the land (owned by the graziers or the state). Don’t think anyone saw the relevance to the topic (I hadn’t mentioned our insignificant efforts at suburban self sufficiency in a rented property). The discussion meandered back to how urban planning controls could or couldn’t shape urban structure and therefore resource use. Afterwards I went over to speak to this bloke from the Uni. Some of the staff and older post grad students seemed to know him, but I had never seen him around E.D. before. He might have been late forties I supposed, stocky, balding slightly, beard covering protruding chin. Meaty hands and thick nicotine stained fingers; of a working man, I thought. I followed up on his idea; we talked on for ages about the rabbit problem and more. His way of thinking and expression were fascinating; grounded but at same time, holistic. Ecological! I thought, but not like any of the activists who called themselves ecologists, or the academically trained ones, who seemed just as reductionist as most scientists. We exhausted our time, then he asked about my arm being in a sling. A brief recount of the motorbike accident and needing to move out of Blackman’s Bay led to an offer to stay till the end of the school year at his place up Strickland Ave on the slopes of the mountain. Sounded ideal.

"Originally published on the PacificEdge blog. WITHOUT DIRECTION we drift like a ship with a broken engine. With a sense of direction we move forward. But to have direction we have to know where we have come from. We have to know where we are going. The Permaculture Calendar has become a means of knowing that. It represents the temporal framework within which we plan our permaculture journey. The Calendar is the engine of our permaculture ship and it is not broken. Thanks to the work of Richard Telford, each year the Permaculture Calendar appears to document the work of some of the practitioners of this distributed network we call permaculture. In this review of next year’s calendar I want to look at two things: Having just written that subhead I realise I have accidentally borrowed it from the writer, Susan Sontag, who wrote a book with that title. But… onto the value of photography. The calendar demonstrates the value of photography in documenting this social movement of ours. It is no secret that the worldwide web has increased the importance of visual communications such as photography, however the use of calendars as visual media predates the web. Thus, the Calendar acknowledges the primacy of visual communication through photography and continues the tradition of the calendar as a medium for it. It discloses in colour the creativity in permaculture. Through the photography appearing in the Permaculture Calendar over the years of its existence we view a history, a visual story of this design system of ours. The Calendars become a visual story of our collective accomplishments, the works of individual permaculture practitioners and also that of the organisations they set up. We can look back and see what we have done and in doing that we start to get a sense of the continuity, the ongoing history of our design system. If we keep the permaculture calendars over the years we can flick through them and in doing so see our story, or part of it, in full colour. There are five photographs showing some aspect of gardening in the  calendar, one about a technology made by hand, another on the craft production of a utilitarian kitchen tool, one about food, one about building and one about recovery after natural disaster. February’s compost system that moves composting wastes downslope as they go through the composting process I know works because I have seen a similar system in use in a community garden. The material degrades as it is moved downslope but because it is not exposed to the heat that a compost heap produces it does not affect the propagation potential of seeds that might happen to be in it, nor does it complete the composting process. The experience of the community garden I mention was that the partially-degraded material needs to be accumulated into a compost bin or system after being moved downslope. Here, it is exposed to the heat build-up that completes the process and allows the material to cure. April’s image of food storage at a homestead, that avoids the use of electricity, shows the value of producing and storing surplus, though such a low-energy lifeway is available only to the few. There is nothing wrong with homesteading, of course, but modern lifeways militate against it. Despite this, in the best tradition of permaculture people manoeuvre around the problem to adopt some of the elements of the homesteading lifestyle. My partner, for example, preserves fruit and other foods using Fowlers Vacola tech even though we live in a small apartment. Likewise, busy urban working people with no time to make bread the traditional way find a solution in technology with their own electronic breadbot, a bread making machine. Although this domestic automation of the breadmaking process might not appeal to traditionalist home bakers who roll, pummel and knead their bread dough, the breadbot offers home bakers a high degree of control over what goes into their food. Food production in the home garden, where that is available, is another possibility although there is much to be said (and Bill Mollison said it) for buying your food from someone who has produced it responsibly through a food co-op, CSA (community supported agriculture) or the hybrid-CSAs/food hubs we have in the big cities. In so doing we contribute more to building the regional food economy than home growing does. “We can also begin to take some part in food production. This doesn’t mean that we all need to grow our own potatoes, but it may mean that we will buy them directly from a person who is already growing potatoes responsibly. In fact, one would probably do better to organize a farmer-purchasing group in the neighborhood than to grow potatoes.”
…Bill Mollison. October’s wheel of ecological culture I find a somewhat contradictory concept. At one point on the wheel it states ‘technology backgrounded’. Yet, a little further on it states ‘energy powerdown — renewables’. Why the contradiction? Because renewable energy systems are hi-tech, they use new types of materials and computerised, automatic control and distribution systems. If we want a society powered by renewables if follows that we want hi-tech. For the most part the wheel is fine as a conceptual map of what its producers see as valuable in an emergent, resilient culture. March’s image appeals to me most of all, perhaps. Not because it is astounding in any photographic sense but because of what it shows — a scaling-up of permaculture ideas in the city to produce food in bulk. We realise this is already happening when we think of Hobart City Farm, Wagtail Urban Farm in Adelaide and the new Pocket City Farm in inner urban Sydney. These are small urban market gardens producing fresh food on a commercial scale. They are important not only because they enact Bill Mollison’s dictum of returning food production to the city, but because they create livelihoods in the new economy. We know that the new economy emerges from the old, it uses the materials, the fuels, the knowledge of the old to create and build the production capacity, the tools, the technologies, the organisational forms of what will replace it. Small scale, intensively managed farmlets in the city like that in March’s photograph are one of those new systems visible in the old and they scale-up backyard and community garden food production and make it available to more people. Images in the  calendar raise a philosophical question about permaculture. Looking through next year’s calendar I find the  photographs a celebration of gardens, food and the handicraft approach to life. All of this is good and all of those skills valuable, however it comes across as being about past values from, as some might see it, the Nineteenth Century being transposed into the Twenty First. Someone, and I don’t recall who, once said that there is a lot of nostalgia in permaculture. They meant nostalgia for those past times, for the era of manual labour, for the handicraft approach to the provision of our needs. Those skills are still useful for those with the wherewithal and time to practice them. What is absent in the Calendar are images of people interacting with modern technology, yet so many permaculture people I know interact with it every day, making modern tech as much about permaculture as the craft technologies. Let’s stop talking about photography and the philosophy of permaculture for a moment to consider the man who produces this calendar. Richard Telford. It is through Richard’s gift of good graphic design that we have the calendar. And through his persistence in producing a new edition year after year. Richard’s work amply demonstrates how publishing, photography and writing — all fall within the ‘invisible systems’ of permaculture — are as much permaculture skills as are growing cabbages or building a small house. Those are the skills through which we, as a social movement, get to know ourself. Without the skill of the photographer, permaculture journalist, author and publisher permaculture would remain ignorant of its challenges, its achievements, its story. It would have no story, no history. The Permaculture Calendar  brings us a visual continuity of that history. So, here we are. … a new permaculture Calendar for a new year. A calendar that through the practice of photography records this design system that we inhabit and in doing so provides us with that sense of continuity I mentioned earlier. But… Richard’s producing the Permaculture Calendar  is only part of the story. Someone has to buy it this year if we want another calendar next year. Buying the Permaculture Calendar  is a vote with our dollar for Richard to produce more editions. Our purchase money is the energy those future editions run on. Our purchase is a way to encourage Richard to produce the calendar over coming years. What better Christmas gift could there be to remind those receiving it of permaculture’s accomplishments, month after month. We don’t actually need Christmas, however, for the calendar offers a way to say thank you to someone who has done us a favour, who has helped us out or whose work we value. It is recognition of another’s value in print form. In giving the calendar we give those receiving it the idea that there are other ways of doing things, there are alternative futures.

Sunrise Farm in Rani Patati village near Kathmandu, is a community farm owned & managed by Mr Shyam Shrestha & his family. It is a working farm, established in , offering demonstration, training and seed & seedling distribution facilities. The farm also runs a program committed to the demonstration and training of sustainable agriculture and community development techniques and approaches Various foods and resources are grown & harvested including roots, grain, leaf, fruit & flower crops from trees, shrubs, grasses and herbs plus firewood, animal fodder and mulch. Crops are protected by integrated pest management strategies, encouraged by microclimate creation and use, etc Immediately after the earthquakes, hundreds of people descended on the farm’s land in order to be away from large buildings that were collapsing all around. The farmhouse was structurally damaged and unsafe and the barn was totally destroyed. Many people, sheltered under hastily constructed plastic tarps, including the Shrestha family. They cooked for dozens of refugees for  days until emergency services, water & electricity reached the area. They continued catering for their community for some weeks, using the farm’s abundant vegetables and grains grown in the organic no-till beds.  Following a crowd funding appeal, donations and a micro-grant from Permafund, work to rebuild Sunrise Farm started in November . However, at the start it was affected by the embargo on Nepal by India that ran from September  until January . Commodities became unavailable or at best, prohibitively expensive, as fuel became rare. Again, while the city starved of cooking gas, forests around the valley began to be stripped. Sunrise Farm was able to cook on its ageing biogas unit fueled by recycled manure plus biomass, supplemented by firewood from the agroforestry section of the farm. This delay time was used for planning & research of the best methods of re-building. As funds accrued, work started in December with de-construction of damaged areas of the house and barn and recycling of the materials. The house build involved jacking up existing concrete beams and strengthening them with new and stronger beams, infilling with traditional brickwork using partially recycled bricks from the demolished walls and partially stabilised compressed earth bricks (SCEBs). The SCEBs were manufactured using a hydraulic ram made in Nepal with an earth and % cement mix. They were not fired. The house has now been completely restored, except for plastering and painting. This will be done in the Autumn (Spring in Southern Hemisphere) of , following a planned training course in lime plastering. Meanwhile work has started on the barn. Sunrise Farm was fortunate to meet International Disaster Volunteers (IDV) with whom they struck up a partnership and who provided an architect and constant stream of volunteers to help the Sunrise Farm family. The barn was built using a combination of SCEBs, stone & mud mortar plus bamboo (both as structural beams and woven as wall fabric), with a corrugated tin and Perspex roof for extra light. Like the house, the barn is complete except for pleasuring and painting. Currently the family is constructing the new training hall. International Disaster Volunteers are helping with this too. The aim is to have this complete, or at least covered, before the monsoon sets in. Sunrise Farm has already begun to host training and demonstration projects thanks to the help of the crowd funding and donations. Permaculture diploma induction events and farmers’ field trip visits will be included. Permafund have provided a micro-grant to support this project, as well as supporting other permaculture projects around the world. Donations of $. or more to Permaculture Australia’s Permafund (Permaculture International Public Fund) are tax deductible in Australia.

Isabella Guerrini, at the University of Perugia in Italy, works in the department of agriculture studying plant and animal consciousness and its integration into ecological pattern and rhythm. Her observations of sap flow in plants confirm that, indeed, fluid flows more full as the moon becomes full, slowing down as the moon wanes. This, she explains, has important consequences for plant growth and pruning: vigorous, sappy plants will suffer if cut, harvested, or pruned close to the full moon. First off, leaking sap exposes the plant to disease and pest incursion. But furthermore, sap from a cut plant, now deprived of its primary outlet, will engorge smaller channels, where new buds are developing on side branches, and potentially rupture those channels leading to the death of the buds (a phenomenon known as “lunar burn”, because it was so often noted around the full moon). Less vigorous, less juicy plants, like ground-covers or vines, conversely may benefit from being cut when sap flow is strong: it will stimulate the development of side shoots and encourage fuller, branching growth. Those who work with plants every day have certainly noticed differences in moisture content, flavor (meaning chemistry), and more. This can have important consequences across a range of applications, from medicine to construction. For an excellent review of the subject, see Ian Cole and Michael Balick’s review article. The authors discuss a range of traditional practices related to moon phase, from the harvesting of construction and thatch materials, to the planting of staple crops, to the gathering of medicines. In their review of some contemporary research, they catalog differences in plant chemistry and fluid balance based on seasonal and circadian (day-long) rhythms, but note that studies that examine lunar rhythms are still few and far between. In my personal experimentation, I concur that flavor and phytochemical variation is most noticeable as part of a seasonal cycle, but moisture content (once variables such as rainfall are accounted for) is very closely tied to lunar cycles. Water weight in a botanical sample can vary up to % between the days just before the full moon and the week before the new moon. This parallels what researchers have found in lumber: wood from spruce and chestnut, harvested in the last week of the moon phase, has the lowest water percentage and shrinks the least during drying. It is rumored that the wooden stilts upon which Venice was built all were harvested during the last few days of the moon cycle: less water and denser fibers means less susceptibility to rotting and parasites. Ernst Zürcher, who published the research on lumber harvesting, expanded on Cole and Balick’s work, cataloging the changes in moisture content, as well as effects on plant germination, growth, and development in many different plants as relates to lunar cycles. The conclusions are consistent: there is indeed a lunar effect. But he also points out that the easy explanation (a tide-like gravitational force) is most likely incorrect, as the amount of water in even the largest tree is relatively small, and a tidal force would be negligible. An intriguing hypothesis is that moonlight itself may contribute to electromagnetic effects that alter the surface tension of water, allowing for some of the microscopic effects that have been experimentally documented. All plants grow differently during different phases of the moon—this has been observed in scientific research since the s and, more recently, documented on the microscopic level by observing changes in rootlet growth. But as to why—this question is still unresolved. What we do know is that moonlight, while generally similar to the sunlight it reflects, shifts a bit towards the infrared (see above spectral graph, from CIRA, at Colorado State University) and also has some gaps that may be linked to the presence of traces of sodium in the lunar “atmosphere”. This makes moonlight not just a less intense version of sunlight—it is somewhat qualitatively different, too. Dr. Guerrini has speculated that the rhythmic, additional irradiation from moonlight is an important adjunct to the growth and metabolism of healthy plants: not only have we seen change in growth and leaf movements, but also in patterns of starch storage (highest in the waning phase) and utilization (highest in the days before the full moon). These effects, along with preliminary documentation of immune deficiency and poor wound healing from moonlight-deprived plants, encourage us to think of moonlight as an important part of a plant’s overall “nutrition”. Interestingly, this “nutrition” seems to be more a modulation of bio-electric activity rather than a source of photosynthetic energy. In conclusion, moonlight is subtle—typically, even at its peak, only about % as strong as sunlight. But its rays penetrate the soil, and affect plant life from germination to harvest. Most plants seem to need a rhythmic exposure to moonlight—at least for a week or so around the full moon—for optimal immunity, wound healing, regeneration, and growth. Plant harvesting should ideally heed the lunar cycle, not simply for potency and low water content, but because many plants (especially strong, vigorous growers) recover better when they are harvested during the last week of the lunar cycle. It seems that the subtle effects of moonlight can alter the way water behaves as it interfaces with living cells, perhaps through bio-electric mechanisms. As the old myths tell us, the moon is a powerful force, regulating the unseen, yin-like processes hidden under the surfaces of things, deeply connected to water and moisture. Easy explanations of its effects can often be misdirection – the moon may seem to lay out a trail for us, but this trail often leads to places we’d never expect. But just as tidal forces served to shape early life on our planet, the more hidden effects we are just starting to understand may be essential to maintain healthy life on earth today.  While the factors that affect plant growth are complex and vary greatly, the basic concept is really quite simple. As the moon increases in light towards the full moon, sap flow is more active. Conversely, as the moon wanes, sap flow slows.

At the turn of the st century the evidence for energy descent driven by peak oil and climate change was already strong. The quasi religious belief in continuous economic growth had a strong hold on collective psychology in central Victoria as much as anywhere in the world. The global financial system began to unravel in  at the same time that global production of conventional oil peaked. For a minority it was increasingly obvious that the policies put in place ensured that the collapse was even more severe when it did come. It was like the powers that be had pushed the accelerator hard to the floor in one of those supercharged sports cars of the time, to attempt to jump across the widening chasm that humanity was facing. The collapse of global financial growth unfolded differently in different places but here the story had many upsides that were partly due to luck and partly a result of visionaries and innovators who helped create a better future. These are the bare bones of how we got from what a few people still consider was the golden age to what we call the Earth Steward culture. In  the Australian property bubble burst. For our communities, this marked the start of the First Energy Descent Crisis (of the st century). Ballarat Bank was the first financial institution to fail and a government forced take over by the Commonwealth Bank saw the Community Bank network hived off as local lending co-ops backed by local government hoping to restart economic activity in regional towns that were increasingly on their own as State and Federal governments focused on dealing with hardship and social unrest in the cities. The crisis was world wide, so dramatically reduced global Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the peak of global oil (what they called Total Liquids at the time) the same year was very much in line with the  Limits To Growth report default scenario showing industrial output peaking about that time. More recent studies suggest that net energy available to support humanity peaked closer to the turn of the millennium but it’s all a moot point because it seems that economic growth had been a net drain on human welfare for decades before that. As capital investment in oil fell off a cliff, and production from existing fields declined at nearly % there was a second oil price shock, a US currency collapse and a short war between the USA and China in . Australia got punished in the trade embargo imposed by China. The economic crisis in China had already caused nearly  million of the recently urbanised workers to return to the villages, and reimposition of a command economy to continue the shift to renewable energy and revitalise agriculture. Consequently China was able to cope without Australian coal and gas and there was so much scrap steel in the world that the iron ore exports had come to a standstill. While oil and food remained costly (at least relative to falling wages) most manufactured goods were dirt-cheap. Solar panels from China (somehow getting around the trade embargo) accelerated the trend for retail customers going off grid which, combined with collapse of commercial demand for electricity, led to a “Death Spiral” in the power grid with rising prices and increasing blackouts (and surges due to excess wind and solar inputs). A newly elected Federal Labor government renationalised the power grid, along with price controls, rationing an Australia ID card allowing rationed access to subsidised supermarkets that had been experiencing shortages of fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy. In Victoria, a Liberal government implemented policies to encourage people to be more self-reliant. Permaculture education was adopted as a framework for integrating aspects of self-reliance including home food production, owner building, water harvesting and waste management. Rationing of fuel led to hitch-hiking, ride sharing and in rural areas a rush to convert vehicles to wood gas. Bicycles became the default personal transport around town in Castlemanine but in Daylesford and Hepburn, electric bikes and vehicles powered by the Hepburn Wind charging stations installed for tourists before the property bubble burst maintained mobility for locals. Conversion of vehicles to wood gas by a range of bush mechanics and ex-hot rodders had mixed success. The market value of higher powered larger vehicles and trucks rose as a result of the first wave of conversions. The Castlemaine Obtainium Engineering Institute was established to test and improve local designs and prototypes. One of the motivations was a competitive spirit with the electric car networks centred in Daylesford and Ballarat. Use of Bitcoin (a virtual currency), local currencies, precious metals and barter all increased to support exchange in the rapidly growing informal and grey economies. Bitcoin then failed in mysterious circumstances after being targeted for funding terrorism. The Internet began functioning again after major breakdowns during the conflict between the US and China. But Facebook and Amazon were bankrupt, cyberspace was littered with defunct and unmaintained sites and Internet marketing was plagued by cyber crime and draconian government regulations. Local computer networks using wireless technology, as well as a revival of two-way radio, started building back to basics communication pathways.;Permaculture Principles

All of the images used on the principle pages have been included in previous Permaculture Calendars, which is now in it’s th incarnation. This website has been designed as a starting point for people who are interested in exploring what permaculture is all about, as well as a place where practitioners can get a better sense of how the principles can be applied. It’s an ideal spot to expose projects that demonstrate permaculture thinking to the hundreds of thousands of people that visit the site each year, as well as the many thousands more who see the calendar up in people homes and offices.  From previous experience it’s good to set yourself an exercise of taking a photo to illustrate a particular principle. This could be a good exercise for permaculture teachers to set students, or a local permaculture group?

"This is a bittersweet farewell and celebration as we say hoo-roo to the Permaculture Principles calendar after  years.  years! That’s  months of appreciation for permaculture projects around the world, and nearly  days of permaculture having pride of place on walls everywhere. We’ve contributed over $,AU to support permaculture projects and change makers too – something we’re proud to reflect upon. As anyone with a wall calendar will attest, those little daily boxes become the custodians of all kinds of precious information; plantings, gatherings, rainfall, heatwaves, loved one’s birthdays, moods, homesteading to-dos and the occasional absentminded work of art. It has been a joy to create each calendar knowing that thousands of people are sharing the same daily experience, noticing and capturing the small, vital stuff of life. And long after each calendar “expires”, it lives on as a treasured time capsule; a ledger of all your legendary permaculture antics – we know that many of these calendars will be in use for years to come. There are still two months to enjoy, but we do realise that many people are getting organised and looking for a calendar to take them into . It won’t be ours, we are sorry to say… but hey, it has been wonderful! Massive thanks to the Permaculture Calendar team who have brought it all together, including the original designers David Arnold and Richard Telford. To Oliver Holmgren, Christine Cahusac, Grace and Felix as well as Emma O’Dell, we are so grateful for your tireless work. Printing in Australia on ethically sourced paper has been supplied from Print Together, Moule Print, Focus Print Group and Printgraphics. A very special thanks to all of the wonderful calendar contributors who furnished each month with permie inspiration. (You can still access all of the images from every contributor on the Permaculture Principles website, by the way.) And to you, a supporter of this special project over the years, we extend our heartfelt gratitude. Permaculture Principles remains deeply committed to celebrating permaculture projects globally, and are on the cusp of launching an exciting new project very soon (hint: it’s educational and free!).

"In the hills east of Canberra, down a dusty lane that passes racehorses dozing in thick phalaris, and wild apple trees and thickets of plum and hawthorn, then winds up the Lake George escarpment through Yellow Box woodland full of finches, thornbills, cuckoo-shrikes, kookaburras and robins, there’s a rusty old gate with a stencilled sign that says “Millpost”. The heritage of our farm is long, complex and rich; challenging to protect in a time of climatic and economic uncertainty. As custodians for thirty-nine years, our family has endeavoured to preserve and enrich this landscape, while earning enough from the land to enjoy the privilege of maintaining stewardship. Permaculture Principle #: Obtain a Yield In January  David and I attended the first-ever PDC at Stanley, Tasmania with Bill Mollison. The insights we gained have guided our decision-making ever since. Minimising food miles, creating stability through diversity, turning problems into assets, zero waste, small-scale and local solutions…these have been our bywords. Millpost was windswept and degraded when David first arrived in . Since then, we’ve planted or direct-seeded approximately  kilometres of native windbreaks using Eucalyptus, Acacia, Bursaria, Callistemon and Casuarinas. Sheep are excluded from about  hectares, including riparian zones, to allow natural regeneration. Stock and wildlife alike benefit from shade and shelter in every paddock. Big increases in bird populations ( sp.) mean improved natural pest control. But it’s not all good news; the resulting increase in kangaroo numbers threatens our viability. Deciduous trees such as poplar, willow, oak, ash, honey locust and black locust are planted strategically to provide fire protection for the homestead complex, as well as stock fodder, shade and food (fruit and nuts). If they sucker, all the better! Both native and exotic trees are harvested for timber (building and fence posts) and firewood (heating and cooking). By harvesting water from shed roofs uphill from dwellings, we use the Permaculture strategy of storing water at the highest possible point and using gravity to move it, rather than relying on pumps. We also place dams as high as possible in the landscape to enable gravity-feeding of water for stock or gardens. Principle #:Catch and Store Energy. David Holmgren created a Whole Farm Plan for us in . We are gradually implementing the design, moving from  large paddocks back in the s to about  today, which we subdivide further with portable electric fencing. The new paddocks allow us to spell over % of the farm at any one time and to keep the sheep out of wet areas when necessary. Our main challenge has been making a living from a relatively infertile farm, especially in frequent severe droughts. Our Permaculture system allowed us to survive low wool prices and other adversities because producing our own food (vegies, fruit, meat, eggs and dairy produce) has lowered our cost of living. Today’s challenge is to provide a livelihood here for our children and their families. We hope our diversification venture, Millpost Merino knitting yarn, will help our family farm survive. Principle #: Integrate Rather than Segregate Our native pastures (more than % of the farm) are botanically diverse and yield well even in drought. Principle #: Use and Value Diversity Bill Mollison told us the difference between conventional farmers and Permaculturists was that the former looked at the land and asked: how can this land be made to produce dollars? Whereas the latter asked: what does it (nature) offer? Principle #: Observe and Interact Merino wool is the finest, softest wool in the world as a result of centuries of careful breeding programmes. Merino sheep can withstand climatic extremes and still produce this robust yet soft, multi-functional fibre for making clothing that can last a lifetime. We are taking the Stewardship approach to our wool enterprise, by protecting and enhancing the endangered temperate native grasslands (including Grassy Yellow Box Woodlands) that make up much of the  hectares of Millpost farm. Sheep are a regenerative tool: they graze pasture hard for short periods then move on to a fresh paddock, allowing grasslands enough time to recover between grazing events. Depending on seasonal conditions, paddocks may be grazed briefly only two or three times per year. We are starting small, with only the very best of our fine wool clip (three bales) being processed for yarn. Principle #: Use Small and Slow Solutions  David’s book Millpost: a broadscale permaculture farm since  is available from our Australian webstore or from the yarn website millpostmerino.com.au";Permaculture Principles
 I discovered the magic of gardening at an early age, looking after Dad’s herbs at home. As a keen cook, he kept quite a collection. There must have been thirty different varieties with each one growing in an individual terracotta pot, neatly lined up in rows on a tiered planter shelf. It was my job to keep them in top shape. Hand watering was a daily task in Perth’s hot, dry summer. Regular feeding to keep the growth soft and palatable, and occasional re-potting, division and replanting – all simple tasks that made a big impact on me. These were the first things that I nurtured and the result of these efforts ended up in our dinner most evenings. My next garden project was a bit more ambitious. At fourteen I set up a four-square-metre ‘no-dig’ vegie patch on top of the lawn in our backyard. I was fascinated by how a few bales of straw, a load of compost and a handful of seeds could be converted into bundles of fresh vegetables within a matter of months. I often tell people that growing food is highly infectious. Once you make a start the sense of satisfaction and reward is overwhelming. I can still vividly recall the moment when it really hit me. It was late one warm afternoon and I had been working in my little patch, which by this stage had expanded to include a number of large tubs filled with tomatoes and climbing beans trailing along the fence. I sat on the lawn, leaning back against the warm red brick wall of our shed and basked in the contentment and satisfaction with what I had created. From that point on I’ve considered myself a gardener. Dad picked up on my new fascination with gardening. As a keen book collector he was thrilled to see me fossicking in second hand book shops as I slowly developed a collection of my own. One evening he gave me two books that he had bought years before and tucked away in a forgotten section of his library. They were first edition copies of Permaculture One and Permaculture Two. They made immediate sense to me. The ideas were logical, the principles were practical and the ethical basis underpinning it all was fair and just. The more I read, the more I started to question things, especially life in a comfortable suburb, living in high energy, wasteful homes, surrounded by high maintenance unproductive landscapes. It was all wrong. Clearly there must be a better way to do it. I realised that I needed to learn more about the natural world and the way that it worked. This realisation influenced my subject selection in high school and eventually led me to study environmental science at university, but it was always the practical aspects of permaculture that kept me inspired. My interest in permaculture got a major boost at the age of nineteen when I stumbled across a neglected suburban block with potential. It was a classic run down rental property that still retained the features typical to the original s homes in the area. There were old fruit trees, a hen shed, a dilapidated glass house and a workshop. There were remnant native species that, given their age, would have pre-dated the development of the area. It was like a time capsule. All around it, time had moved on. Dalkeith was now a prestigious riverside address noted for its leafy gardens and proximity to private schools. Meanwhile number  Circe Circle was still like something out of the BBC classic The Good Life. My brother was renting the place with his mates. The first time I visited I thought to myself, “I’ve got to get this place!” Timing was on my side and it wasn’t long before he moved out and I moved in. And so began my first serious garden project. Being my first rental property, I wasn’t exactly sure of what the rules were when it came to working in the garden. The place was a complete mess so I assumed that any work tidying up was bound to be appreciated. I started off tentatively. I was busy studying at university and was also running a part-time local gardening round, so my early efforts were mainly limited to exploring the various nooks and crannies of the block. Each session was like an archaeological dig. The more things I’d discovered including old tools and forgotten pathways, the more intrigued I became with the garden. It wasn’t long before I decided the best thing to do was to drop down to part-time study and take this project more seriously. Whether it was my growing passion for gardening or an avoidance strategy for chemistry and statistics is beside the point – it was the best thing I ever did. Over the next six years, my housemates and I rejuvenated the property and created a remarkable garden that combined friendship, learning, fun with a real feeling of independence and self-reliance. We pulled the lawn up, repaired the glasshouse, repaired the sheds, installed a rainwater tank and set up trellises for growing fruit trees and vines. We built new pens for ducks and aviaries for pigeons and quail. We experimented with solar ovens and composting toilets, brewed beer and baked bread. It was brilliant. Being poor students we learnt how to be resourceful with salvaged materials and created a space with rambling pathways, extended poultry runs, homemade garden seats, worm farms and compost bays. We basically overhauled the place and it wasn’t long until I actually felt as if the property was ours. What we did buy, we bought locally. There was a small group of shops around the corner called the ‘Dalkeith Village’ which had been there (in more humble form) since the suburb began in the s. There was a bakery, a little supermarket, a bottle shop, a nursery and even a small father-son owned hardware store where you could still buy individual nails. Of course they charged like a wounded bull, earning the proprietor the nickname ‘Old Man Fleece’ amongst my housemates, but that didn’t really matter. It was more important for us to know that we were supporting local businesses, which provided the convenience, comfort and security that we had what we needed near by. In time we struck up great relationships with our elderly neighbours. Most had been there for some forty plus years and remembered a time when everyone had fruit trees and chooks in their backyard. I’m sure that they thought we were odd to start with, but when they realised we were really having a go, their interest grew. It wasn’t long before I was passing eggs and homegrown produce over the fence. In return they would make jams, give tips on the best local plant varieties and dear old Mrs James up the back would throw her scraps over for our chooks. There was a real sense of community. My friends were also fascinated. When people visited they’d head straight for the chooks. At night I’d give tours by torchlight to explore the jungle like garden and spot frogs. Being born in the mid s, we were part of a generation that didn’t automatically connect with gardening and self-reliance. Perhaps that was part of the buzz for me, in that we were doing something different – something inherently practical and something that just made sense. In , the th International Permaculture Conference (IPC) was to be held in Perth, and with it a special Permaculture Design Course (PDC) was to be run involving a number of respected WA permaculturists as guest teachers. I’d been planning to do my PDC for a while, but as a student, time and cost were always an issue. Attending IPC was an opportunity too good to miss. I deferred from university for a semester, cranked up the gardening round to save up some money and registered for the design course and conference. By this stage, I was confident with many of the practical aspects of permaculture from the hands-on skills that I had developed in my backyard and on my gardening round, but I was eager to explore new concepts in design and relate them to my academic studies. The PDC, conference and site tours that followed certainly provided this and made me realise that it was time to leave the comfort of my backyard and neighbourhood and expand my skill set by working on other projects. As always an opportunity soon presented itself. One of the site tours we took during the PDC was to the Environmental Technology Centre at Murdoch University (the university where I was studying). It was a fascinating project which had been set up as a research and development facility to explore the applications of small-scale environmental technologies in the areas of water supply, sanitation, energy, shelter, and food production. The research group’s main focus at the time was the application of appropriate technologies for improved environmental health in remote indigenous communities, however they had also fostered an active local community group to help with the development of the .-hectare site. It was just what I was looking for – a fresh, practical learning environment at an exciting scale to develop new skills. The infrastructure was impressive including solar powered bores, a hybrid (wind and solar) remote area power system, composting toilets and a range of wastewater reuse systems. There were demonstration buildings made from strawbale and mud brick, and the beginnings of a productive landscape including aquaculture ponds, food forest and vegetable gardens. I signed up as a volunteer and was soon spending most of my time there. My home garden was established and thriving and I was enjoying putting my energies into something different. Before long I was employed as site coordinator and spent the next five years managing the ongoing design and development of the site whilst completing my undergraduate degree. Like many good projects we were under-funded financially but were able to achieve a great deal due to the commitment of staff, students and community volunteers. There was a strong shared vision for the importance of demonstrating low impact ways of living and increasing self-reliance. We ran Work for the Dole programs, hosted Corrective Services participants and kept the doors open for anyone who wanted to participate or learn about permaculture. Alongside my site work, I was extremely fortunate to be mentored through a broad range of academic experiences. It was a unique situation where I was expected to teach, present at conferences and undertake field work around WA, all before graduating. This was possible thanks to a progressive group of academics who saw the value in practical experience, recognised passion and provided me with the opportunities to grow.

"Rocket stove combustion systems deserve attention for a few reasons: That’s right – you can build these systems in a day or two, and then watch them turn twigs into heat far more efficiently than most wood stoves, with far less set-up cost. If you are good at scavenging bits they can cost virtually nothing to build, and when you prune your fruit trees you can get the fuel you need to cook dinner, heat your home, and enjoy a nice hot shower. The main difference between a normal fireplace or woodstove and a rocket stove is that rocket combustion is close to complete. When wood is burned it releases volatile compounds that we recognise as smoke or soot or creosote. In a rocket stove these compounds are sucked into the insulated and very hot ‘burn tunnel’ of the unit where they combust, releasing even more heat energy to drive the rocket process, unlike a normal fire where they are blown out the chimney. This distinctive sucking of the flames down into the burn tunnel, and the resultant ‘roar’ is what gives rocket stoves their name. This is also a part of their magic. Rocket stoves are open where the wood is fed in, allowing lots of oxygen to be drawn into the unit. As the fire starts, and the burn tunnel heats up, the rising hot air races up the heat riser, drawing lots of air behind it. This incoming air flows into the feed tube and across the burning wood – creating the same effect as pointing a big air-blower at your fire. It gets really hot, the wood burns beautifully, and you hear the air roaring as it charges through the system. In conventional wood stoves the air intake is small, and adjustable to even smaller. This lack of oxygen chokes the combustion, leading to cool burns, incomplete combustion and lots of smoke and creosote. When combustion is complete, what comes out the chimney is pretty much only carbon dioxide, meaning no smoke: smoke means incomplete combustion, unburned fuel, or wasted energy. We are culturally trained to associate smoke with fire; but with rocket stoves, sometimes when there is no smoke, there is still fire! Having ensured complete combustion, and hence maximum heat generation, only then do we think about using the resultant heat. Conventional wood stoves are sucking heat away from the combustion chamber for cooking, space heating or with ‘wet back’ water heaters, meaning the unit just can’t get hot enough for combustion to be complete, resulting in smoke. The combustion chamber of the rocket stove is heavily insulated to prevent premature heat loss, and an enormous amount of heat is generated by the efficient combustion process. When combustion is complete, we can extract heat from the stove at the top of the heat riser. And here is where your imagination and inner inventor can run wild: anything you can think to do with very hot air can be done from this point. Here are a few things that can be powered with a rocket stove. Take care! A well-built rocket stove can work so well it can be dangerous. Dan’s rocket oven once got to  °C in six minutes,  °C in seven minutes, and  °C in thirteen minutes! As for Joel’s latest rocket oven, on his first test run the whole inner skin of the feed tube was glowing red, as was the bottom of the inside of the oven: the thermometer read  °C, and the roast vegies were pretty charred (he has since tamed it down to  °C). While quite popular in some parts of the world, rocket stoves are a relatively rare sight in Australian permaculture systems. They are an excellent example of an appropriate technology alternative to conventional means of heating food, water or space; and they are well worth finding out more about.

 That is the motivation behind our new book, The Art of Frugal Hedonism: A Guide to Spending less While Enjoying Everything More. We coined the phrase ‘frugal hedonist’, to refer to someone who greedily laps up all of life’s non-monetised pleasures, whilst keeping themselves free enough to enjoy these pleasures by under-indulging in ‘comfort and convenience’ spending. Less money spent, equals less pressure to work, equals more flexibility to do the things that make you really happy! So familiar is the notion that consuming less is a sacrifice made for the sake of saving money or conserving resources, that it is easy to resent whatever we are giving up and overlook all the glorious side effects of a thriftier lifestyle. But take a step back, and the picture becomes clearer. While it might at first seem that spending less requires more effort, oversupply of consumables (of the level most modern first-worlders experience) actually has a tendency to turn right back into efforts that we need to expend. For example, the effort required to go to the gym/ weight loss support group/ doctor because you were oversupplied with cheap consumables and labour-saving devices. Not to mention the effort required to go to work to pay for those services. The Frugal Hedonist recognises the efficiency of a little restraint here and there, and the greater pleasures to be gained! Ride to the shops instead of driving, chop up that whopper pumpkin that you grew with an axe and make it into soup to take for lunch instead of buying takeaway, hang out your laundry because you’re too cheap to use a dryer, and base your holidays around hiking to waterfalls rather than eating at new cafes in different places, and the effort required to stay fit and healthy gets taken care of while you were doing other things. Marvellous. Another often-ignored side-effect of restricting our consumption is that it keeps us alive to appreciating the consumption we do do. Scoring an amazing cashmere jumper from a second hand store can only be fully relished by someone who doesn’t have a wardrobe already crammed with impulse buys from every shop in the mall. The pleasure of buying a mango from a street stall to eat messily on a summer’s afternoon park bench can only be as succulent to someone who doesn’t grab a chocolate bar every time they go through a supermarket checkout. Really having not enough is horrible: persistent hunger and cold make you unwell and stressed. Having just enough, plus a little more, is absolutely lovely. Having even more than that, just because it’s the cultural norm, starts to make you unwell and stressed all over again – although the connection is often less obvious. The problems of overabundance and ‘over-ease’ in Western cultures are hitting full stride in the form of our tight waistbands, overstuffed closets and overflowing rubbish tips. Let’s stop denying ourselves the full benefits of a connected, curious, materially-modest, sensually indulgent lifestyle. Let’s get Frugally Hedonistic.

"Many of you may have heard about our project by now. Permatil (Permaculture Timor Leste), xpand Foundation and Disruptive Media have come together to produce the Tropical Permaculture Guidebook. Developed from the highly successful Permaculture Guidebook from Timor Leste published by Permatil in ; used by farmers, families, community groups, trainers, government departments, schools, universities, agricultural colleges and NGOs in Timor Leste, and re-used and translated in more than  countries. The guidebook is open source because that is the permaculture way, and with rapid change desperately needed, we need permaculture education and resources to spread as fast as possible. Across the globe it is clear that a big shift is starting to occur; towards small-scale intensive, organic, family owned agriculture systems. We can help accelerate this, and ensure that permaculture’s whole systems design approach is integrated as well. Enabling this change to occur requires farmers and families having access to the information, strategies and techniques they need. On top of this, climate change is already creating havoc with food production and water supplies, and vulnerable communities in the tropics are hardest hit. It will increase dramatically unless fast action is taken. Increasing soil and carbon content in the soil is perhaps the easiest and most important measure needed to reduce climate change. **  This guidebook tackles these fundamental issues on climate change, simultaneously providing permaculture’s solutions and creating community resilience. It turns theory into practical steps that anyone can take and use to affect positive change. All aspects of food production and living are covered, including a focus on agroecological, small-scale, organic food production, integrating crops and based on regenerating soil, water and the surrounding environment.  The new edition is a comprehensive up date; including hundreds of new illustrations, new chapters and techniques, with the content now generalised for all tropical countries. The easy to understand information can be used by readers of all economic and social backgrounds, and with over  detailed illustrations, it is especially useful for semi-literate and illiterate people. Once the English edition is complete, and when further funding is attained, translations to other languages including Spanish, French, Portuguese and national languages will commence. Follow us on Facebook at Tropical Permaculture Guidebook and you can also sign up to the email list to receive occasional updates regarding the progress of the guidebook, both online and printed editions. There are currently six chapters completed and available from www.permacultureguidebook.org with the other chapters being added as they are finished. If you are able to support the project by donating a small amount of money, it will help achieve the production goals and keep the guidebook free for those who can’t afford it. There is a donate button next to the chapters for download, or you can go straight to the crowdfunding campaign.  “Several years ago I came across the original publication and thought what an excellent resource it is for villages and teachers of permaculture. It’s strength lies in the number of strategies and techniques it offer practitioners. The book is easy to handle and well indexed. The drawings are clear and represent a reality for readers. It is especially valuable in being available in several languages. I introduced it to a permaculture design class in East Timor and the students were excited to have information of such good quality. The book’s potential is beyond the islands of SE Asia. For example I had some chapters of the book translated into Luganda in Uganda and it was immediately swallowed up by keen students and we could have printed many many copies. Having taught in so many tropical countries with their range of ecosystems, it is evident that the guidebook needs wider dissemination around the equatorial regions. All equatorial east and west Africa, and then there is South America. One of the problems in disseminating permaculture information is lack of suitable and relevant resources particularly for the tropic regions. I hope the present book will be revised, updated and made available to students and farmers to meet a need for their will and right to know, and render their lives more sustainable and productive.”    Rowe Morrow is the author of several books for permaculture students and teachers.

"My two year student/mentor relationship with Bill from late  was certainly the defining relationship that set the course for the rest of my life. The article ‘A Chance Meeting’ (below) recalled that pivotal moment when I first met Bill and effectively selected him as ‘the teacher’. Bill’s brilliance was in gathering together the ecological insights, principles, strategies and techniques that could be applied to create the world we do want rather than fighting against the world we reject. His personal life was as tumultuous as his public persona, at times tragic but always full of the passion and contradiction that the term ‘ecological warrior’ represents. His legacy lives on in all those who were transformed by his teaching. This tribute by leading British permaculture teacher, Graham Bell, provides an excellent overview of his life including his confronting character.   A seminar “How Patterns of Land Tenure Shape the Exploitation of Natural Resources” sounded mildly interesting. I wondered whether our household efforts at self sufficient living in a rented house with a friendly and helpful landlady might be a relevant example. Most young people seemed to think it was really weird putting so much work into building up the soil and improving the garden, when we didn’t own the house. Well it wasn’t the landlady that was cutting short my tenure. The shared house thing was starting to go sour with John and Sue. They obviously wanted their own space, as a couple with their baby. It was time to move on. But what a pain – with the garden planted and only a month to go before flying back to Western Australia for end year holidays. The seminar, and most of the contributions from the usual participants seemed fairly predictable but there was this guy from the Uni** whose contribution caught my attention. He talked about how rabbit trappers could have controlled rabbits (prior to Myxomatosis) if they had the incentive through a stake in the land (owned by the graziers or the state). Don’t think anyone saw the relevance to the topic (I hadn’t mentioned our insignificant efforts at suburban self sufficiency in a rented property). The discussion meandered back to how urban planning controls could or couldn’t shape urban structure and therefore resource use. Afterwards I went over to speak to this bloke from the Uni. Some of the staff and older post grad students seemed to know him, but I had never seen him around E.D. before. He might have been late forties I supposed, stocky, balding slightly, beard covering protruding chin. Meaty hands and thick nicotine stained fingers; of a working man, I thought. I followed up on his idea; we talked on for ages about the rabbit problem and more. His way of thinking and expression were fascinating; grounded but at same time, holistic. Ecological! I thought, but not like any of the activists who called themselves ecologists, or the academically trained ones, who seemed just as reductionist as most scientists. We exhausted our time, then he asked about my arm being in a sling. A brief recount of the motorbike accident and needing to move out of Blackman’s Bay led to an offer to stay till the end of the school year at his place up Strickland Ave on the slopes of the mountain.

"Originally published on the PacificEdge blog. WITHOUT DIRECTION we drift like a ship with a broken engine. With a sense of direction we move forward. But to have direction we have to know where we have come from. We have to know where we are going. The Permaculture Calendar has become a means of knowing that. It represents the temporal framework within which we plan our permaculture journey. The Calendar is the engine of our permaculture ship and it is not broken. Thanks to the work of Richard Telford, each year the Permaculture Calendar appears to document the work of some of the practitioners of this distributed network we call permaculture. In this review of next year’s calendar I want to look at two things: Having just written that subhead I realise I have accidentally borrowed it from the writer, Susan Sontag, who wrote a book with that title. But… onto the value of photography. The calendar demonstrates the value of photography in documenting this social movement of ours. It is no secret that the worldwide web has increased the importance of visual communications such as photography, however the use of calendars as visual media predates the web. Thus, the Calendar acknowledges the primacy of visual communication through photography and continues the tradition of the calendar as a medium for it. It discloses in colour the creativity in permaculture. Through the photography appearing in the Permaculture Calendar over the years of its existence we view a history, a visual story of this design system of ours. The Calendars become a visual story of our collective accomplishments, the works of individual permaculture practitioners and also that of the organisations they set up. We can look back and see what we have done and in doing that we start to get a sense of the continuity, the ongoing history of our design system. If we keep the permaculture calendars over the years we can flick through them and in doing so see our story, or part of it, in full colour. There are five photographs showing some aspect of gardening in the  calendar, one about a technology made by hand, another on the craft production of a utilitarian kitchen tool, one about food, one about building and one about recovery after natural disaster. February’s compost system that moves composting wastes downslope as they go through the composting process I know works because I have seen a similar system in use in a community garden. The material degrades as it is moved downslope but because it is not exposed to the heat that a compost heap produces it does not affect the propagation potential of seeds that might happen to be in it, nor does it complete the composting process. The experience of the community garden I mention was that the partially-degraded material needs to be accumulated into a compost bin or system after being moved downslope. Here, it is exposed to the heat build-up that completes the process and allows the material to cure. April’s image of food storage at a homestead, that avoids the use of electricity, shows the value of producing and storing surplus, though such a low-energy lifeway is available only to the few. There is nothing wrong with homesteading, of course, but modern lifeways militate against it. Despite this, in the best tradition of permaculture people manoeuvre around the problem to adopt some of the elements of the homesteading lifestyle. My partner, for example, preserves fruit and other foods using Fowlers Vacola tech even though we live in a small apartment. Likewise, busy urban working people with no time to make bread the traditional way find a solution in technology with their own electronic breadbot, a bread making machine. Although this domestic automation of the breadmaking process might not appeal to traditionalist home bakers who roll, pummel and knead their bread dough, the breadbot offers home bakers a high degree of control over what goes into their food. Food production in the home garden, where that is available, is another possibility although there is much to be said (and Bill Mollison said it) for buying your food from someone who has produced it responsibly through a food co-op, CSA (community supported agriculture) or the hybrid-CSAs/food hubs we have in the big cities. In so doing we contribute more to building the regional food economy than home growing does. “We can also begin to take some part in food production. This doesn’t mean that we all need to grow our own potatoes, but it may mean that we will buy them directly from a person who is already growing potatoes responsibly. In fact, one would probably do better to organize a farmer-purchasing group in the neighborhood than to grow potatoes.”
…Bill Mollison. October’s wheel of ecological culture I find a somewhat contradictory concept. At one point on the wheel it states ‘technology backgrounded’. Yet, a little further on it states ‘energy powerdown — renewables’. Why the contradiction? Because renewable energy systems are hi-tech, they use new types of materials and computerised, automatic control and distribution systems. If we want a society powered by renewables if follows that we want hi-tech. For the most part the wheel is fine as a conceptual map of what its producers see as valuable in an emergent, resilient culture. March’s image appeals to me most of all, perhaps. Not because it is astounding in any photographic sense but because of what it shows — a scaling-up of permaculture ideas in the city to produce food in bulk. We realise this is already happening when we think of Hobart City Farm, Wagtail Urban Farm in Adelaide and the new Pocket City Farm in inner urban Sydney. These are small urban market gardens producing fresh food on a commercial scale. They are important not only because they enact Bill Mollison’s dictum of returning food production to the city, but because they create livelihoods in the new economy. We know that the new economy emerges from the old, it uses the materials, the fuels, the knowledge of the old to create and build the production capacity, the tools, the technologies, the organisational forms of what will replace it. Small scale, intensively managed farmlets in the city like that in March’s photograph are one of those new systems visible in the old and they scale-up backyard and community garden food production and make it available to more people. Images in the  calendar raise a philosophical question about permaculture. Looking through next year’s calendar I find the  photographs a celebration of gardens, food and the handicraft approach to life. All of this is good and all of those skills valuable, however it comes across as being about past values from, as some might see it, the Nineteenth Century being transposed into the Twenty First. Someone, and I don’t recall who, once said that there is a lot of nostalgia in permaculture. They meant nostalgia for those past times, for the era of manual labour, for the handicraft approach to the provision of our needs. Those skills are still useful for those with the wherewithal and time to practice them. What is absent in the Calendar are images of people interacting with modern technology, yet so many permaculture people I know interact with it every day, making modern tech as much about permaculture as the craft technologies. Let’s stop talking about photography and the philosophy of permaculture for a moment to consider the man who produces this calendar. Richard Telford. It is through Richard’s gift of good graphic design that we have the calendar. And through his persistence in producing a new edition year after year. Richard’s work amply demonstrates how publishing, photography and writing — all fall within the ‘invisible systems’ of permaculture — are as much permaculture skills as are growing cabbages or building a small house. Those are the skills through which we, as a social movement, get to know ourself. Without the skill of the photographer, permaculture journalist, author and publisher permaculture would remain ignorant of its challenges, its achievements, its story. It would have no story, no history. The Permaculture Calendar  brings us a visual continuity of that history. So, here we are. … a new permaculture Calendar for a new year. A calendar that through the practice of photography records this design system that we inhabit and in doing so provides us with that sense of continuity I mentioned earlier. But… Richard’s producing the Permaculture Calendar  is only part of the story. Someone has to buy it this year if we want another calendar next year. Buying the Permaculture Calendar  is a vote with our dollar for Richard to produce more editions. Our purchase money is the energy those future editions run on. Our purchase is a way to encourage Richard to produce the calendar over coming years. What better Christmas gift could there be to remind those receiving it of permaculture’s accomplishments, month after month. We don’t actually need Christmas, however, for the calendar offers a way to say thank you to someone who has done us a favour, who has helped us out or whose work we value. It is recognition of another’s value in print form. In giving the calendar we give those receiving it the idea that there are other ways of doing things, there are alternative futures.

Sunrise Farm in Rani Patati village near Kathmandu, is a community farm owned & managed by Mr Shyam Shrestha & his family. It is a working farm, established in , offering demonstration, training and seed & seedling distribution facilities. The farm also runs a program committed to the demonstration and training of sustainable agriculture and community development techniques and approaches Various foods and resources are grown & harvested including roots, grain, leaf, fruit & flower crops from trees, shrubs, grasses and herbs plus firewood, animal fodder and mulch. Crops are protected by integrated pest management strategies, encouraged by microclimate creation and use, etc Immediately after the earthquakes, hundreds of people descended on the farm’s land in order to be away from large buildings that were collapsing all around. The farmhouse was structurally damaged and unsafe and the barn was totally destroyed. Many people, sheltered under hastily constructed plastic tarps, including the Shrestha family. They cooked for dozens of refugees for  days until emergency services, water & electricity reached the area. They continued catering for their community for some weeks, using the farm’s abundant vegetables and grains grown in the organic no-till beds.  Following a crowd funding appeal, donations and a micro-grant from Permafund, work to rebuild Sunrise Farm started in November . However, at the start it was affected by the embargo on Nepal by India that ran from September  until January . Commodities became unavailable or at best, prohibitively expensive, as fuel became rare. Again, while the city starved of cooking gas, forests around the valley began to be stripped. Sunrise Farm was able to cook on its ageing biogas unit fueled by recycled manure plus biomass, supplemented by firewood from the agroforestry section of the farm. This delay time was used for planning & research of the best methods of re-building. As funds accrued, work started in December with de-construction of damaged areas of the house and barn and recycling of the materials. The house build involved jacking up existing concrete beams and strengthening them with new and stronger beams, infilling with traditional brickwork using partially recycled bricks from the demolished walls and partially stabilised compressed earth bricks (SCEBs). The SCEBs were manufactured using a hydraulic ram made in Nepal with an earth and % cement mix. They were not fired. The house has now been completely restored, except for plastering and painting. This will be done in the Autumn (Spring in Southern Hemisphere) of , following a planned training course in lime plastering. Meanwhile work has started on the barn. Sunrise Farm was fortunate to meet International Disaster Volunteers (IDV) with whom they struck up a partnership and who provided an architect and constant stream of volunteers to help the Sunrise Farm family. The barn was built using a combination of SCEBs, stone & mud mortar plus bamboo (both as structural beams and woven as wall fabric), with a corrugated tin and Perspex roof for extra light. Like the house, the barn is complete except for pleasuring and painting. Currently the family is constructing the new training hall. International Disaster Volunteers are helping with this too. The aim is to have this complete, or at least covered, before the monsoon sets in. Sunrise Farm has already begun to host training and demonstration projects thanks to the help of the crowd funding and donations. Permaculture diploma induction events and farmers’ field trip visits will be included. Permafund have provided a micro-grant to support this project, as well as supporting other permaculture projects around the world.

Isabella Guerrini, at the University of Perugia in Italy, works in the department of agriculture studying plant and animal consciousness and its integration into ecological pattern and rhythm. Her observations of sap flow in plants confirm that, indeed, fluid flows more full as the moon becomes full, slowing down as the moon wanes. This, she explains, has important consequences for plant growth and pruning: vigorous, sappy plants will suffer if cut, harvested, or pruned close to the full moon. First off, leaking sap exposes the plant to disease and pest incursion. But furthermore, sap from a cut plant, now deprived of its primary outlet, will engorge smaller channels, where new buds are developing on side branches, and potentially rupture those channels leading to the death of the buds (a phenomenon known as “lunar burn”, because it was so often noted around the full moon). Less vigorous, less juicy plants, like ground-covers or vines, conversely may benefit from being cut when sap flow is strong: it will stimulate the development of side shoots and encourage fuller, branching growth. Those who work with plants every day have certainly noticed differences in moisture content, flavor (meaning chemistry), and more. This can have important consequences across a range of applications, from medicine to construction. For an excellent review of the subject, see Ian Cole and Michael Balick’s review article. The authors discuss a range of traditional practices related to moon phase, from the harvesting of construction and thatch materials, to the planting of staple crops, to the gathering of medicines. In their review of some contemporary research, they catalog differences in plant chemistry and fluid balance based on seasonal and circadian (day-long) rhythms, but note that studies that examine lunar rhythms are still few and far between. In my personal experimentation, I concur that flavor and phytochemical variation is most noticeable as part of a seasonal cycle, but moisture content (once variables such as rainfall are accounted for) is very closely tied to lunar cycles. Water weight in a botanical sample can vary up to % between the days just before the full moon and the week before the new moon. This parallels what researchers have found in lumber: wood from spruce and chestnut, harvested in the last week of the moon phase, has the lowest water percentage and shrinks the least during drying. It is rumored that the wooden stilts upon which Venice was built all were harvested during the last few days of the moon cycle: less water and denser fibers means less susceptibility to rotting and parasites. Ernst Zürcher, who published the research on lumber harvesting, expanded on Cole and Balick’s work, cataloging the changes in moisture content, as well as effects on plant germination, growth, and development in many different plants as relates to lunar cycles. The conclusions are consistent: there is indeed a lunar effect. But he also points out that the easy explanation (a tide-like gravitational force) is most likely incorrect, as the amount of water in even the largest tree is relatively small, and a tidal force would be negligible. An intriguing hypothesis is that moonlight itself may contribute to electromagnetic effects that alter the surface tension of water, allowing for some of the microscopic effects that have been experimentally documented. All plants grow differently during different phases of the moon—this has been observed in scientific research since the s and, more recently, documented on the microscopic level by observing changes in rootlet growth. But as to why—this question is still unresolved. What we do know is that moonlight, while generally similar to the sunlight it reflects, shifts a bit towards the infrared (see above spectral graph, from CIRA, at Colorado State University) and also has some gaps that may be linked to the presence of traces of sodium in the lunar “atmosphere”. This makes moonlight not just a less intense version of sunlight—it is somewhat qualitatively different, too. Dr. Guerrini has speculated that the rhythmic, additional irradiation from moonlight is an important adjunct to the growth and metabolism of healthy plants: not only have we seen change in growth and leaf movements, but also in patterns of starch storage (highest in the waning phase) and utilization (highest in the days before the full moon). These effects, along with preliminary documentation of immune deficiency and poor wound healing from moonlight-deprived plants, encourage us to think of moonlight as an important part of a plant’s overall “nutrition”. Interestingly, this “nutrition” seems to be more a modulation of bio-electric activity rather than a source of photosynthetic energy. In conclusion, moonlight is subtle—typically, even at its peak, only about % as strong as sunlight. But its rays penetrate the soil, and affect plant life from germination to harvest. Most plants seem to need a rhythmic exposure to moonlight—at least for a week or so around the full moon—for optimal immunity, wound healing, regeneration, and growth. Plant harvesting should ideally heed the lunar cycle, not simply for potency and low water content, but because many plants (especially strong, vigorous growers) recover better when they are harvested during the last week of the lunar cycle. It seems that the subtle effects of moonlight can alter the way water behaves as it interfaces with living cells, perhaps through bio-electric mechanisms. As the old myths tell us, the moon is a powerful force, regulating the unseen, yin-like processes hidden under the surfaces of things, deeply connected to water and moisture. Easy explanations of its effects can often be misdirection – the moon may seem to lay out a trail for us, but this trail often leads to places we’d never expect. But just as tidal forces served to shape early life on our planet, the more hidden effects we are just starting to understand may be essential to maintain healthy life on earth today.  While the factors that affect plant growth are complex and vary greatly, the basic concept is really quite simple. As the moon increases in light towards the full moon, sap flow is more active. Conversely, as the moon wanes, sap flow slows.

At the turn of the st century the evidence for energy descent driven by peak oil and climate change was already strong. The quasi religious belief in continuous economic growth had a strong hold on collective psychology in central Victoria as much as anywhere in the world. The global financial system began to unravel in  at the same time that global production of conventional oil peaked. For a minority it was increasingly obvious that the policies put in place ensured that the collapse was even more severe when it did come. It was like the powers that be had pushed the accelerator hard to the floor in one of those supercharged sports cars of the time, to attempt to jump across the widening chasm that humanity was facing. The collapse of global financial growth unfolded differently in different places but here the story had many upsides that were partly due to luck and partly a result of visionaries and innovators who helped create a better future. These are the bare bones of how we got from what a few people still consider was the golden age to what we call the Earth Steward culture. In  the Australian property bubble burst. For our communities, this marked the start of the First Energy Descent Crisis (of the st century). Ballarat Bank was the first financial institution to fail and a government forced take over by the Commonwealth Bank saw the Community Bank network hived off as local lending co-ops backed by local government hoping to restart economic activity in regional towns that were increasingly on their own as State and Federal governments focused on dealing with hardship and social unrest in the cities. The crisis was world wide, so dramatically reduced global Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the peak of global oil (what they called Total Liquids at the time) the same year was very much in line with the  Limits To Growth report default scenario showing industrial output peaking about that time. More recent studies suggest that net energy available to support humanity peaked closer to the turn of the millennium but it’s all a moot point because it seems that economic growth had been a net drain on human welfare for decades before that. As capital investment in oil fell off a cliff, and production from existing fields declined at nearly % there was a second oil price shock, a US currency collapse and a short war between the USA and China in . Australia got punished in the trade embargo imposed by China. The economic crisis in China had already caused nearly  million of the recently urbanised workers to return to the villages, and reimposition of a command economy to continue the shift to renewable energy and revitalise agriculture. Consequently China was able to cope without Australian coal and gas and there was so much scrap steel in the world that the iron ore exports had come to a standstill. While oil and food remained costly (at least relative to falling wages) most manufactured goods were dirt-cheap. Solar panels from China (somehow getting around the trade embargo) accelerated the trend for retail customers going off grid which, combined with collapse of commercial demand for electricity, led to a “Death Spiral” in the power grid with rising prices and increasing blackouts (and surges due to excess wind and solar inputs). A newly elected Federal Labor government renationalised the power grid, along with price controls, rationing an Australia ID card allowing rationed access to subsidised supermarkets that had been experiencing shortages of fresh fruit, vegetables and dairy. In Victoria, a Liberal government implemented policies to encourage people to be more self-reliant. Permaculture education was adopted as a framework for integrating aspects of self-reliance including home food production, owner building, water harvesting and waste management. Rationing of fuel led to hitch-hiking, ride sharing and in rural areas a rush to convert vehicles to wood gas. Bicycles became the default personal transport around town in Castlemanine but in Daylesford and Hepburn, electric bikes and vehicles powered by the Hepburn Wind charging stations installed for tourists before the property bubble burst maintained mobility for locals. Conversion of vehicles to wood gas by a range of bush mechanics and ex-hot rodders had mixed success. The market value of higher powered larger vehicles and trucks rose as a result of the first wave of conversions. The Castlemaine Obtainium Engineering Institute was established to test and improve local designs and prototypes. One of the motivations was a competitive spirit with the electric car networks centred in Daylesford and Ballarat. Use of Bitcoin (a virtual currency), local currencies, precious metals and barter all increased to support exchange in the rapidly growing informal and grey economies. Bitcoin then failed in mysterious circumstances after being targeted for funding terrorism. The Internet began functioning again after major breakdowns during the conflict between the US and China. But Facebook and Amazon were bankrupt, cyberspace was littered with defunct and unmaintained sites and Internet marketing was plagued by cyber crime and draconian government regulations. Local computer networks using wireless technology, as well as a revival of two-way radio, started building back to basics communication pathways.;Permaculture Principles
We are always on the lookout for images to help give a wider interpretation of how the design principles can be applied. All of the images used on the principle pages have been included in previous Permaculture Calendars, which is now in it’s th incarnation. This website has been designed as a starting point for people who are interested in exploring what permaculture is all about, as well as a place where practitioners can get a better sense of how the principles can be applied. It’s an ideal spot to expose projects that demonstrate permaculture thinking to the hundreds of thousands of people that visit the site each year, as well as the many thousands more who see the calendar up in people homes and offices.  From previous experience it’s good to set yourself an exercise of taking a photo to illustrate a particular principle. This could be a good exercise for permaculture teachers to set students, or a local permaculture group? Permaculture Northern Beaches in Sydney ran a photo competition with the ‘Stalled by the Roadside’ image selected for the  calendar. If you think that you may have something, point me to your online photo library or email me your images and I’ll let you know if there is a possibility or two. Photos with people and/or animals in them tend to fare well as they help bring images to life. I’m after photos (or illustrations) in landscape format that are high resolution jpeg files (around  x  pixels), so that they can be printed at over A size. Email your submissions to [email protected] before the th of June . If your image is selected as the cover for the Permaculture Calendar you’ll receive twelve copies, a further eleven selections will receive four copies along with links and credits – a small token of thanks for successful contributions.

"This is a bittersweet farewell and celebration as we say hoo-roo to the Permaculture Principles calendar after  years.  years! That’s  months of appreciation for permaculture projects around the world, and nearly  days of permaculture having pride of place on walls everywhere. We’ve contributed over $,AU to support permaculture projects and change makers too – something we’re proud to reflect upon. As anyone with a wall calendar will attest, those little daily boxes become the custodians of all kinds of precious information; plantings, gatherings, rainfall, heatwaves, loved one’s birthdays, moods, homesteading to-dos and the occasional absentminded work of art. It has been a joy to create each calendar knowing that thousands of people are sharing the same daily experience, noticing and capturing the small, vital stuff of life. And long after each calendar “expires”, it lives on as a treasured time capsule; a ledger of all your legendary permaculture antics – we know that many of these calendars will be in use for years to come. There are still two months to enjoy, but we do realise that many people are getting organised and looking for a calendar to take them into . It won’t be ours, we are sorry to say… but hey, it has been wonderful! Massive thanks to the Permaculture Calendar team who have brought it all together, including the original designers David Arnold and Richard Telford. To Oliver Holmgren, Christine Cahusac, Grace and Felix as well as Emma O’Dell, we are so grateful for your tireless work. Printing in Australia on ethically sourced paper has been supplied from Print Together, Moule Print, Focus Print Group and Printgraphics. A very special thanks to all of the wonderful calendar contributors who furnished each month with permie inspiration. (You can still access all of the images from every contributor on the Permaculture Principles website, by the way.) And to you, a supporter of this special project over the years, we extend our heartfelt gratitude. Permaculture Principles remains deeply committed to celebrating permaculture projects globally, and are on the cusp of launching an exciting new project very soon (hint: it’s educational and free!). With warmth, The Permaculture Principles team P.S. If you’ve yet to dive deeply into the principles, try reading Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability. Or for a brain-illuminating immersion, consider doing a Permaculture Design Course, like the Ashram PDC or Online PDC with co-originator David Holmgren.";Permaculture Principles
"In the hills east of Canberra, down a dusty lane that passes racehorses dozing in thick phalaris, and wild apple trees and thickets of plum and hawthorn, then winds up the Lake George escarpment through Yellow Box woodland full of finches, thornbills, cuckoo-shrikes, kookaburras and robins, there’s a rusty old gate with a stencilled sign that says “Millpost”. The heritage of our farm is long, complex and rich; challenging to protect in a time of climatic and economic uncertainty. As custodians for thirty-nine years, our family has endeavoured to preserve and enrich this landscape, while earning enough from the land to enjoy the privilege of maintaining stewardship. Permaculture Principle #: Obtain a Yield In January  David and I attended the first-ever PDC at Stanley, Tasmania with Bill Mollison. The insights we gained have guided our decision-making ever since. Minimising food miles, creating stability through diversity, turning problems into assets, zero waste, small-scale and local solutions…these have been our bywords. Millpost was windswept and degraded when David first arrived in . Since then, we’ve planted or direct-seeded approximately  kilometres of native windbreaks using Eucalyptus, Acacia, Bursaria, Callistemon and Casuarinas. Sheep are excluded from about  hectares, including riparian zones, to allow natural regeneration. Stock and wildlife alike benefit from shade and shelter in every paddock. Big increases in bird populations ( sp.) mean improved natural pest control. But it’s not all good news; the resulting increase in kangaroo numbers threatens our viability. Deciduous trees such as poplar, willow, oak, ash, honey locust and black locust are planted strategically to provide fire protection for the homestead complex, as well as stock fodder, shade and food (fruit and nuts). If they sucker, all the better! Both native and exotic trees are harvested for timber (building and fence posts) and firewood (heating and cooking). By harvesting water from shed roofs uphill from dwellings, we use the Permaculture strategy of storing water at the highest possible point and using gravity to move it, rather than relying on pumps. We also place dams as high as possible in the landscape to enable gravity-feeding of water for stock or gardens. Principle #:Catch and Store Energy. David Holmgren created a Whole Farm Plan for us in . We are gradually implementing the design, moving from  large paddocks back in the s to about  today, which we subdivide further with portable electric fencing. The new paddocks allow us to spell over % of the farm at any one time and to keep the sheep out of wet areas when necessary. Our main challenge has been making a living from a relatively infertile farm, especially in frequent severe droughts. Our Permaculture system allowed us to survive low wool prices and other adversities because producing our own food (vegies, fruit, meat, eggs and dairy produce) has lowered our cost of living. Today’s challenge is to provide a livelihood here for our children and their families. We hope our diversification venture, Millpost Merino knitting yarn, will help our family farm survive. Principle #: Integrate Rather than Segregate Our native pastures (more than % of the farm) are botanically diverse and yield well even in drought. Principle #: Use and Value Diversity Bill Mollison told us the difference between conventional farmers and Permaculturists was that the former looked at the land and asked: how can this land be made to produce dollars? Whereas the latter asked: what does it (nature) offer? Principle #: Observe and Interact Merino wool is the finest, softest wool in the world as a result of centuries of careful breeding programmes. Merino sheep can withstand climatic extremes and still produce this robust yet soft, multi-functional fibre for making clothing that can last a lifetime. We are taking the Stewardship approach to our wool enterprise, by protecting and enhancing the endangered temperate native grasslands (including Grassy Yellow Box Woodlands) that make up much of the  hectares of Millpost farm. Sheep are a regenerative tool: they graze pasture hard for short periods then move on to a fresh paddock, allowing grasslands enough time to recover between grazing events. Depending on seasonal conditions, paddocks may be grazed briefly only two or three times per year. We are starting small, with only the very best of our fine wool clip (three bales) being processed for yarn. Principle #: Use Small and Slow Solutions  David’s book Millpost: a broadscale permaculture farm since  is available from our Australian webstore or from the yarn website millpostmerino.com.au";Permaculture Principles
 I discovered the magic of gardening at an early age, looking after Dad’s herbs at home. As a keen cook, he kept quite a collection. There must have been thirty different varieties with each one growing in an individual terracotta pot, neatly lined up in rows on a tiered planter shelf. It was my job to keep them in top shape. Hand watering was a daily task in Perth’s hot, dry summer. Regular feeding to keep the growth soft and palatable, and occasional re-potting, division and replanting – all simple tasks that made a big impact on me. These were the first things that I nurtured and the result of these efforts ended up in our dinner most evenings. My next garden project was a bit more ambitious. At fourteen I set up a four-square-metre ‘no-dig’ vegie patch on top of the lawn in our backyard. I was fascinated by how a few bales of straw, a load of compost and a handful of seeds could be converted into bundles of fresh vegetables within a matter of months. I often tell people that growing food is highly infectious. Once you make a start the sense of satisfaction and reward is overwhelming. I can still vividly recall the moment when it really hit me. It was late one warm afternoon and I had been working in my little patch, which by this stage had expanded to include a number of large tubs filled with tomatoes and climbing beans trailing along the fence. I sat on the lawn, leaning back against the warm red brick wall of our shed and basked in the contentment and satisfaction with what I had created. From that point on I’ve considered myself a gardener. Dad picked up on my new fascination with gardening. As a keen book collector he was thrilled to see me fossicking in second hand book shops as I slowly developed a collection of my own. One evening he gave me two books that he had bought years before and tucked away in a forgotten section of his library. They were first edition copies of Permaculture One and Permaculture Two. They made immediate sense to me. The ideas were logical, the principles were practical and the ethical basis underpinning it all was fair and just. The more I read, the more I started to question things, especially life in a comfortable suburb, living in high energy, wasteful homes, surrounded by high maintenance unproductive landscapes. It was all wrong. Clearly there must be a better way to do it. I realised that I needed to learn more about the natural world and the way that it worked. This realisation influenced my subject selection in high school and eventually led me to study environmental science at university, but it was always the practical aspects of permaculture that kept me inspired. My interest in permaculture got a major boost at the age of nineteen when I stumbled across a neglected suburban block with potential. It was a classic run down rental property that still retained the features typical to the original s homes in the area. There were old fruit trees, a hen shed, a dilapidated glass house and a workshop. There were remnant native species that, given their age, would have pre-dated the development of the area. It was like a time capsule. All around it, time had moved on. Dalkeith was now a prestigious riverside address noted for its leafy gardens and proximity to private schools. Meanwhile number  Circe Circle was still like something out of the BBC classic The Good Life. My brother was renting the place with his mates. The first time I visited I thought to myself, “I’ve got to get this place!” Timing was on my side and it wasn’t long before he moved out and I moved in. And so began my first serious garden project. Being my first rental property, I wasn’t exactly sure of what the rules were when it came to working in the garden. The place was a complete mess so I assumed that any work tidying up was bound to be appreciated. I started off tentatively. I was busy studying at university and was also running a part-time local gardening round, so my early efforts were mainly limited to exploring the various nooks and crannies of the block. Each session was like an archaeological dig. The more things I’d discovered including old tools and forgotten pathways, the more intrigued I became with the garden. It wasn’t long before I decided the best thing to do was to drop down to part-time study and take this project more seriously. Whether it was my growing passion for gardening or an avoidance strategy for chemistry and statistics is beside the point – it was the best thing I ever did. Over the next six years, my housemates and I rejuvenated the property and created a remarkable garden that combined friendship, learning, fun with a real feeling of independence and self-reliance. We pulled the lawn up, repaired the glasshouse, repaired the sheds, installed a rainwater tank and set up trellises for growing fruit trees and vines. We built new pens for ducks and aviaries for pigeons and quail. We experimented with solar ovens and composting toilets, brewed beer and baked bread. It was brilliant. Being poor students we learnt how to be resourceful with salvaged materials and created a space with rambling pathways, extended poultry runs, homemade garden seats, worm farms and compost bays. We basically overhauled the place and it wasn’t long until I actually felt as if the property was ours. What we did buy, we bought locally. There was a small group of shops around the corner called the ‘Dalkeith Village’ which had been there (in more humble form) since the suburb began in the s. There was a bakery, a little supermarket, a bottle shop, a nursery and even a small father-son owned hardware store where you could still buy individual nails. Of course they charged like a wounded bull, earning the proprietor the nickname ‘Old Man Fleece’ amongst my housemates, but that didn’t really matter. It was more important for us to know that we were supporting local businesses, which provided the convenience, comfort and security that we had what we needed near by. In time we struck up great relationships with our elderly neighbours. Most had been there for some forty plus years and remembered a time when everyone had fruit trees and chooks in their backyard. I’m sure that they thought we were odd to start with, but when they realised we were really having a go, their interest grew. It wasn’t long before I was passing eggs and homegrown produce over the fence. In return they would make jams, give tips on the best local plant varieties and dear old Mrs James up the back would throw her scraps over for our chooks. There was a real sense of community. My friends were also fascinated. When people visited they’d head straight for the chooks. At night I’d give tours by torchlight to explore the jungle like garden and spot frogs. Being born in the mid s, we were part of a generation that didn’t automatically connect with gardening and self-reliance. Perhaps that was part of the buzz for me, in that we were doing something different – something inherently practical and something that just made sense. In , the th International Permaculture Conference (IPC) was to be held in Perth, and with it a special Permaculture Design Course (PDC) was to be run involving a number of respected WA permaculturists as guest teachers. I’d been planning to do my PDC for a while, but as a student, time and cost were always an issue. Attending IPC was an opportunity too good to miss. I deferred from university for a semester, cranked up the gardening round to save up some money and registered for the design course and conference. By this stage, I was confident with many of the practical aspects of permaculture from the hands-on skills that I had developed in my backyard and on my gardening round, but I was eager to explore new concepts in design and relate them to my academic studies. The PDC, conference and site tours that followed certainly provided this and made me realise that it was time to leave the comfort of my backyard and neighbourhood and expand my skill set by working on other projects. As always an opportunity soon presented itself. One of the site tours we took during the PDC was to the Environmental Technology Centre at Murdoch University (the university where I was studying). It was a fascinating project which had been set up as a research and development facility to explore the applications of small-scale environmental technologies in the areas of water supply, sanitation, energy, shelter, and food production. The research group’s main focus at the time was the application of appropriate technologies for improved environmental health in remote indigenous communities, however they had also fostered an active local community group to help with the development of the .-hectare site. It was just what I was looking for – a fresh, practical learning environment at an exciting scale to develop new skills. The infrastructure was impressive including solar powered bores, a hybrid (wind and solar) remote area power system, composting toilets and a range of wastewater reuse systems. There were demonstration buildings made from strawbale and mud brick, and the beginnings of a productive landscape including aquaculture ponds, food forest and vegetable gardens. I signed up as a volunteer and was soon spending most of my time there. My home garden was established and thriving and I was enjoying putting my energies into something different. Before long I was employed as site coordinator and spent the next five years managing the ongoing design and development of the site whilst completing my undergraduate degree. Like many good projects we were under-funded financially but were able to achieve a great deal due to the commitment of staff, students and community volunteers. There was a strong shared vision for the importance of demonstrating low impact ways of living and increasing self-reliance. We ran Work for the Dole programs, hosted Corrective Services participants and kept the doors open for anyone who wanted to participate or learn about permaculture. Alongside my site work, I was extremely fortunate to be mentored through a broad range of academic experiences. It was a unique situation where I was expected to teach, present at conferences and undertake field work around WA, all before graduating. This was possible thanks to a progressive group of academics who saw the value in practical experience, recognised passion and provided me with the opportunities to grow.

"Permaculture Visions Permaculture Training Online Pioneers Rocket stoves are super efficient. All you need is a bundle of sticks or dried cobs to cook dinner for the whole family. Best of all, this fuel is easy to find. There’s no need to chop down trees or burn fossil fuel. Last month we went on a great adventure staying in an ancient village in the Shandong province of north-eastern China. We went with fellow Australian, Shoaying. She grew up in rural China and has expertise in Permaculture and Environment Management. Shoaying is patient, knowledgeable, well-organised and fun. We were keen to see early stove technology known as the Kang. Our Permaculture courses demonstrate the use of integrated technologies such as a hybrid Rocket stove. According to research at Tongji University, “The Chinese Kang is an ancient integrated home system for cooking, sleeping, domestic heating and ventilation. It is still widely used today in nearly % of rural homes in northern China. In , there were  million Kangs used by  million people.” Archeologists have found Kangs from , years ago. The Kang is still cooking, heating, drying herbs and garments and ventilating millions of homes everyday. Ingeniously, the flue of the stove fans out underneath the big family bed in the next room before rising up a chimney in the next wall. The warmth must be a joy when it is snowing outside and fuel is low. Unfortunately, the Chinese Kang is in slow decline due to intense urbanisation. Given that each household uses approximately kg of poor quality fuel, a small city of a million people would need to bring in , tonnes of fuel each day and dispose or reuse the ash. This would incur a transportation and network cost. Not to mention the need to redesign existing urban buildings to incorporate chimneys. However, more efficient rocket-stoves are growing in popularity in other rural and sub-urban areas of the world.  Essentially, a Rocket Stove has well-engineered air flow, there is a J bend to the chimney and good insulation to increase combustion temperatures. The hottest spot in a rocket stove is not at the flame, it is a little further up where the gases get fully party. As a result, the gases burn off furiously, whipping around in circles before they go up the chimney. A modern rocket stove sounds like a primitive turbo. To get this effect, it has a very good air intake and an elbow in the chimney. The fuel sits on a grate letting the air rush up from underneath. The combustion chamber is underneath the cookplate. In many other wood stoves, a lot of the heat flies away up the chimney. The rocket stove intensifies the burn then concentrates energy directly at the pan. Today, science is building toward a standard for the term ‘Rocket’ stove. Because there is a tiny-sized, yet big difference between a modern Rocket stove [or Rocket-mass heater] the ancient Kang. The modern Rocket stove has an insulated post-combustion chamber (technical term for a space between the flametips and the cookplate). This chamber intensifies the burn and reduces potential pollutants. In addition to this technical development, a moving cowl would increase the Venturi effect of the chimney.  Insulation in a firebox is vital for conserving energy. As a result, the outer area of the stove stays cool. Only the flue heats up. In well insulated stoves, the energy is concentrated on the cook-top. In China, locally made mud-straw bricks surround their stoves. Sand or ash in the mud-brick can ensure even higher insulation-rates. The Kang utilises the residual chimney heat. The chimney gases travel from the cooktop through the wall and fan out along a set of tunnels under the bed in the next room, then up a chimney on the next wall. Unlike the insulated stove, the bed has plenty of thermal mass, and the mattress is thin. So, the bed is toasty warm up by the time the dishes are washed.  Fuel is easy to find for the stove. For instance, most people burn a bundle of prunings from local orchards or stalks from the corn and wheat fields. In addition to these, dried corncobs (after the juicy kernels have been removed) combust very well. Each house has a collection of little bundles of sticks at their door and sunning on the roof. Corn husks (the papery outer layer) are a convenient, easy, biodegradable material. Perfect to wrap the dumplings. Also, rinsing and drying the wrappers enables easy re-use. Finally, these used wrappers become great starter-fuel for the stove.  Northern Chinese Kang Stoves are very adaptable. You can cook fish or soup at the bottom of the giant wok and stick corn cakes to the sloping sides. Alternatively, you can use water in the base and insert a grid at half way up to steam foods like the dumplings. The video shows how to make glass noodles. Rocket Stove cuisine of Northern China doesn’t bake or grill foods. In summary, closed cook-pans with quick cook times are more efficient. At the end of the day, home-made Mooncakes taste wonderful when steam-baked on a kang stove, the traditional way.  By the way, we have aPermaculture Design Weekend Course – Novth and Novth
come and join us!  Permaculture design thinking has brought success in many situations. Permaculture seeded the transition movement, built huge aid development programs and helped millions of urban gardeners worldwide. Permaculture techniques have enriched farm regeneration. But you don’t have to leave the armchair to use permaculture thinking. New groundbreaking social structures are popping. And business strategies have emerged. In s permaculture activists were fighting for a way to conserve native forests by growing more food in the cities. Now permaculture is fighting for healthier environments for both the people and the wildlife. We see huge populations without breathable air, clean water or healthy food. World Health Organisations now recognise that planet health and human health is closely interconnected. We strive for a fair share but the ultimate success would be a win-win. A win for a rich and diverse environment and a win for human health and prosperity. A holistic design approach can contain steady stabilisers, fancy enhancers and an ability for energy and information flow. Mollison says ‘A permaculture design is like a bicycle’. With this new perspective we can see that the seat, pedals and symmetry of the tool ensures stability. The tyres providing padding to the wheels, the suspension under the seat, the gears and the brakes are all system enhancers. The bicycle chain enables the obvious notion of a flow of energy from the pedals to the wheels. But another clever system flow device is the steering. The steering mechanism lets the rider respond to changes in the path. This allows information to flow from the bicycle to the rider. Adaption can be instantaneous and smooth. The modern bicycle is a clever and comfortable design. A skilled rider can steer without touching the handle bar and often without concentrating.  Mollison didn’t formally list a set of permaculture principles in his text. But he and many other permaculture teachers have gleaned these from his texts including Permaculture: A Designer’s Manual. Stress-free Yield: By giving each element several functions we can accept that not all the functions can be performed all the time. A duck will hunt for snails, eat weeds and fertilise the garden. She will swim, preen, mate or shout at strangers. The eggs that are produced per busy duck are lower than in controlled conditions but the sum of all the functions is greater. when it makes itself redundant eg. a Tractor can work a landscape that will no longer require a tractor to manage it. Learn about Permaculture with us, the pioneers of online permaculture training.  Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Save Permaculture is a design tool. The permaculture design principles can also be applied to the design of a small business. Here are some examples of applied Permaculture Principles. The principles used here are those taught by Bill Mollison (and some by David Holmgren). An element is a component of your system or business. Your list of elements may include: intellectual property, office, marketing, natural capital (such as water, fruit/nuts), presentation material such as boxes, jars, labels, product information, transport, time for delivery (especially for services), customer feedback processes. These elements are then analysed to determine their needs and all their potential functions, not just the functions we seek. We then use the principle of relative location to link them together to optimise efficiency. Connect elements by their function and needs. Elements can be linked in a energy chain or network. Here’s how it could work in a simple system like an orchard: Through the principle of relative location we link the shed, the orchard and the geese (a biological resource). Some elements are linked more closely ie. Workers need education and procedures. Procedures need feedback from workers.   Each Element in the design should be used and positioned to perform a range of functions. Use existing physical, social and biological capital to maximum energy potential: share resources such as cars, support local transport, build structures that can work to shelter the garden as well as store heat for night-time, require minimal energy in maintenance, and are durable. Avoid abandoning ideas, technology, machinery or computers that are not competitive without first examining ways to update/expand and increase their efficiency. Many users do not use their equipment to full potential, they are still learning the potential of the current one while considering a new model. Some offices can be made more efficient by natural resources such as natural lighting, solar or sun-heating, coupling the room with a greenhouse window or room. Remember that customers will expect your office to be a working model of sustainability. Ideally it should not look expensive but should be simple, comfortable, accessible, well-lit, full of natural fibres and a view of a garden. A clever small business example is GroCycle in Totnes, UK where the business cut the processing cost of growing mushrooms by using an abundant pre-processed waste – coffee grinds. A farm would aim to include a variety of species of food plants, pollinators, animals and workers. This principle works in Business when we value a diverse range of supplies, techniques and technologies. Diversity in nature builds resilience and resistance to pest attack. It also lets us find which variety works well in our own particular climate and micro-climates. This concept aims to maximise the productivity of a system. In the same way a food forest can have numerous layers. A business can have many layers and zones: Work with the natural and social context. Fit the design into its surroundings. Look at the wider social environment as a key to what will work. At the steps of parliament house, Berlin (The Reistag), there is a huge ‘lawn’ area that is designed to withstand wet conditions and high pedestrian traffic. It works with nature and provides for the needs of the people. Another example can be seen when planting expensive crops in poor regions. These require more human intervention (in the form of security). Whereas a design that considers the social environment involves the community; provides work; and shares the profits with that community. It also benefits from pride, protection and support from that community. In nature: consideration of context can mean the choice of mixed species suited to the sites natural advantages. E.g. water collection, condensation trapping, shelter, sediment as occurs at an oasis. We can also see what to avoid. E.g. if the design is within an area of natural fragility we would avoid planting trees whose seed are carried by birds or wind. From the initial source (sun, rain, wind, and animals) energy is diverted, used, released again and transferred from one element to another. Energy connects the elements. Their common use of energy forms the web of relationships. From the source to the sink (the place where the energy leaves the system): A business can be truly sustainable and ethical when it is resilient, responsive and responsible. This is a hard conversion in the short-term, especially when competitors are cutting costs by using economic slaves and polluting the environment. However, being ethical and environmentally responsible facilitates long term market harmony and prosperity. If you are running an ethical or permaculture small business why not get your credentials? We run an online Permaculture Design Course that will help you evaluate and put permaculture principals into your life and all your projects.  Email Address Subscribe";Permaculture Visions
By Heather Jo Flores My goal with these projects is to give people access to the resources I wish had been available when I first started to learn permaculture about this stuff, way back in the ’s. We didn’t have much in the way of internet then, and Facebook hadn’t even been invented yet. So we used the library and good old fashioned hands-on trial and error to figure stuff out. If humanity has a snowball’s chance at survival in the coming climate cataclysm, it will be permaculture tools and techniques that get us out of this mess. But we need to get on it, NOW, and it pains me to see finances preventing people from experiencing the joy and fascination that comes with learning permaculture. So I’m doing something about it. Here you’ll find suggestions for learning permaculture for free, and also for finding ways to fund your permaculture education. I only make suggestions based on what I, myself have done and continue to do. But before you read any more of this article, go and enroll yourself in this course. Designed specifically for folks who don’t have a lot of time or money, this course will give you one bite-sized class per week for a full year, taking you step-by-step through a permaculture design process, focused on your own home, garden, and community. I know, this is so obvious. And you already know there are a bunch of amazing permaculture books that you can get at the library. But did you know you can download a ton of excellent reading material, including some full-text PDFs of the best books about permaculture? Ok maybe you know that too. But where do you start? It’s overwhelming. To help cut out the noise, I’ve selected a handful of super-value texts to get you started. Food Not Lawns was born out of the “Sustainable Horticulture” study group we had going at our house in Eugene. We met up every week and discussed texts — like a book club, but with more dirt! We often had our meetings in somebody’s garden, where we could discuss ideas while pulling weeds. Stacking functions! Now that we have the internet, there are so many excellent study groups online. Again, it’s overwhelming, and some of the Facebook permaculture groups aren’t really that helpful. (In fact, as bizarre as it seems, several of the largest Facebook permaculture groups are run by internet trolls, unfortunately! So be careful!) Here are the forums I created and moderate.  If there is someone in your community whose work you admire, approach them and volunteer to help. We can learn so much from help each other, and through respecting and seeking out the wisdom of our elders. And, if you are are a wise elder, consider looking for an young’un to pass your skills on to. Maybe you know a lot about something besides permaculture, but you want to learn permaculture? How about setting up a skillshare with somebody? Most of the permaculture teachers I know LOVE doing exchanges like this. If you can’t think of anyone in your own area, start hanging out at the farmer’s market. Or, check out our faculty and see if one of those folks inspires you to reach out.  This one is obvious too, but it cannot be overstated. You can take a dozen expensive design courses and still have no idea what you’re talking about. You have to get out there and start designing! Beyond designing, it’s important that you get dirty and do some serious implementation. Only through years of hard-won experiential knowledge will you ever truly master the fine art and science of permaculture design. The good news is, implementing permaculture design projects is pretty much the funnest thing ever! This publication you’re reading right now, Permaculture Women Magazine, is packed full of hands-on ideas to help you find new ways to get your hands dirty with permaculture. Type any keyword into the search box and see what you find! Ok, I know this whole article is supposed to be about learning permaculture without having to attend an expensive design course. And I’m a very critical, skeptical person myself. But I have to say, a good permaculture design course, taught by knowledgeable people who have taken the time to learn not just how to do permaculture but also how to teach it…well it can completely change your life. And there are ways to pay for it. I’ve known tons of students who did a gofundme with friends and family to come up with tuition money, offering the reward of teaching free workshops to funders afterwards. Others, like myself, leveraged existing community projects to get funding from the local municipality. Back in , after two years of being super visible and growing gorgeous gardens all over the neighborhood, Food Not Lawns got a grant from the City of Eugene to pay Jude Hobbs and Toby Hemenway to do a -hour certification course for myself and twenty neighbors. It was awesome! Most cities have little bits of funding for stuff like this, and if you frame it right, you can raise money to hire top-quality teachers and still be able to offer training for free to yourself and your friends. What I am saying is: think outside the box. You’re a designer now, you can do this. Meawhile, enroll in this free course–you’ll be amazed at how intensive it is! See you in there! ;Free Permaculture

"What is permaculture? Here's an expansive Permaculture FAQ with a collection of helpful links to help you on your permaculture learning journey. by Heather Jo Flores What is permaculture? Originally coined as a blend of “Permanent Agriculture,” the term permaculture has evolved over the last five decades to embody a community and practice much broader than just farming. Permaculture is a form of sustainable design science that focuses on creating robust ecosystems modeled after natural ones. Sometimes referred to as “ecological design,” this practice is geared towards building self-reliant, resilient human communities that enhance rather than deplete the environment. Permaculture champions the use of organic materials and natural gardening techniques to set up ecosystems capable of meeting human necessities like food, water, shelter, and energy. This involves growing specific types of plants such as fruit and nut trees and adopting techniques like agroforestry and food forests. It equips individuals with the tools they need to design systems that are beneficial for both human beings and the planet. Permaculture promotes a mindset of working in harmony with nature to create self-sustaining systems. The goal is to obtain what humans require while safeguarding the environment. If the concept of permaculture seems a bit overwhelming or theoretical, remember it’s more about the journey than the destination. It’s not a product, it’s a process. To navigate the practical and theoretical sides of permaculture, a core set of ethics guides the practice. There are three primary principles: Earth Care, emphasizing the protection and renewal of natural resources; People Care, which nurtures individual and community well-being; and a variation of Fair Share, advocating for equitable resource distribution and surplus sharing. Alternate interpretations of the Fair Share ethic range from “Limits to Growth and Consumption,” proposed by Mollison, to “Careful Process” by Bloom and Boehnlein, “Future Care” by Harland, and more. ​Ok so, what is permaculture? The short answer:
It’s ecological design. The long answer:
“Permaculture” as a practice, simply means observing nature, researching tools and techniques used by indigenous people in your bioregion, and engaging in a diligent, daily practice of balancing the needs of yourself and your family with those of the other species all around you. All of us have this knowing inside of us, and the ecological design process is about uncovering that knowing, and applying it to our physical, social, and emotional landscapes, with the goal of creating living, evolving systems that mimic nature, produce food and energy, and regenerate, rather than annihilate, the Earth. But it’s still got something to do with gardening, right? Yes, gardening is part of any ecological design, because plants are a part of life. Without them, we die. So, if we are creating systems in which we can thrive and be of help to other species, then we have to include plants! But we must never stop there. The garden inspires us, feeds us, connects us to nature…and then we have to get to work on the rest of the system. Because permaculture designers transform scarcity into abundance. The ecological design process balances human needs with the needs of other species. An ecological design creates systems made up of organisms, mechanisms, and feedback. Plus, it’s super fun and personally rewarding. You can: It’s a common misconception that you need to own land to practice permaculture. One of the great advantages of ecological design is that it can be applied to any space, whether it is a small urban balcony or a large rural farm. Examples of successful permaculture projects can be found across various land sizes. Urban rooftops can be transformed into productive spaces by applying vertical gardening techniques, container gardening, and planting perennial plants. Suburban backyard gardens can incorporate permaculture garden ideas by integrating fruit trees, vegetable beds, and integrated pest management techniques. And of course, larger rural farms can implement food forests and broad-scale conservation strategies that create and regenerate habitat for myriad species. Permaculture and organic gardening share a common goal of growing food without chemicals. But growing food is only one very small part of permaculture. Permaculture goes beyond organic gardening by incorporating conscious design and observation as integral parts of the process. It is a holistic approach that aims to create self-sustaining and regenerative systems, not only in the garden but also in all aspects of life. Permaculture and regenerative agriculture share many similarities and intersections, yet they are not the same concept. Regenerative agriculture focuses specifically on restoring and improving the health of agricultural systems. It employs a range of practices such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, and organic soil management to regenerate soil health, enhance biodiversity, and increase resilience to climate change. This approach acknowledges that agriculture can have a positive impact on the environment, and aims to move beyond merely reducing harm to actually improving ecosystems. Permaculture extends beyond agriculture to encompass the design and integration of sustainable systems in all aspects of human habitation. Permaculture design principles can be applied to a wide range of disciplines, such as architecture, energy systems, water management, and community development. While permaculture and regenerative agriculture share common goals, permaculture serves as a holistic framework for conscious design and harmonious integration of natural systems within all aspects of life. It emphasizes self-sufficiency, closed-loop processes, and the use of natural materials. This broader, whole-systems approach sets permaculture apart. As such, organic gardening, regenerative agriculture, silviculture, carbon farming, and all other eco-farming teachniques can fall under the umbrella of permaculture, but on their own, none of these techniques have as much power and potential as a whole-system design.  Permaculture aims to establish balanced, fruitful ecosystems by thoughtfully crafting systems that resemble the natural world. This method places a strong focus on biodiversity, environmental conservation, and soil restoration. This makes it a far more sustainable choice compared to traditional ways of farming and resource extraction. A key tenet of permaculture is the deployment of a wide array of plants and animals to forge stable, resilient ecosystems. For instance, introducing a mix of plant species and beneficial insects can help gardens and farms naturally fend off pests and diseases. This cuts down the need for synthetic fertilizers and chemical pesticides. This focus on biodiversity further bolsters the resilience and overall well-being of the ecosystem. When it comes to farming, permaculture leans on practices like intercropping and agroforestry, which drastically reduce the necessity for heavy irrigation and rule out the need for harmful chemical additives. Intercropping involves planting different crops in proximity to make optimal use of space and nutrients. Agroforestry combines trees and shrubs with crops, leveraging their natural abilities to provide shade and recycle nutrients. These methods enhance crop yields while lowering water consumption and minimizing the need for chemical fertilizers. Furthermore, soil restoration is a top priority in permaculture. Techniques such as composting, mulching, and cover cropping work to elevate soil fertility, improve water-holding capacity, and boost the overall vigor of the soil ecosystem. With healthy soils, farms are less dependent on external resources and can better adapt to changes in climate. Overall, permaculture’s focus on biodiversity, environmental conservation, and soil renewal positions it as an extremely sustainable strategy for both agriculture and land management. It reduces dependency on water, pesticides, and deforestation, all while nurturing long-term ecological health and productivity. Here’s a fascinating paper: Permaculture—Scientific Evidence of Principles for the Agroecological Design of Farming Systems The answer is yes. There are as many ways to make a living with permaculture as there are fruit trees in the food forest! Permaculture offers a multitude of income opportunities for those willing to embrace its principles. The key to making a living with permaculture is diversification. By combining multiple income streams, you can observe the natural principle of redundancy and create a stable and sustainable livelihood, all while contributing to a more harmonious integration between human habitats and natural ecosystems. Organic market farming is the most obvious example. Fruits, vegetables, seeds–all of those yummy chemical-free organic crops have a high value in a market hungry for environmentally conscious food. Additionally, offering permaculture design services is another viable income stream. As people become more aware of the need for sustainable living, there is increasing demand for permaculture designers who can help individuals and communities create productive ecosystems that mimic natural systems. Many designers also earn money teaching permaculture courses. If you choose to go this route, be sure to get some training in the teaching of permaculture, not just the design strategies. Also, depending where you live, providing permaculture consulting services can be a profitable venture. Many individuals and organizations may require guidance and advice on how to integrate permaculture principles into their existing operations. By offering consulting services, permaculture experts can assist them in transitioning towards more sustainable practices. However, while permaculture courses teach a generalist way of seeing the world through an ecological lens, if you want to make a good living in permaculture you’ll probably need to find a niche. Most of the most successful eco-entrepreneurs have found a specific niche market that works for their particular area of expertise.  Check out this free/donation-based online course about how to find your profitable, ethical eco-niche. Bill Mollison, often credited as the “founder of permaculture,” was an Australian traveler, scientist, baker, fisherman, gardener, autodidact, and writer who researched and published extensive genealogies of Indigenous Australians, and through this work he became inspired to dedicate the rest of his life to learning and teaching integrated ways for humans to live on the planet without destroying it. Mollison worked with many people and wrote, co-wrote, and inspired many books, organized hundreds of courses, and traveled all over the world collecting and sharing information about ecological design. He was especially enchanted with the notion of agricultural systems working together with human home systems so that each meets the needs of the other, and collaborated on a huge array of visionary design drawings with his then-colleague and illustrator, Reny Slay. Mollison was also influenced by writers who had come before him, such as Rachel Carson (Silent Spring, ), Ken & Barbara Kern (The Owner-Built Home, ), P.A. Yeomans (Water for Every Farm, ), and J. Russel Smith, who wrote Tree Crops for a Permanent Agriculture (), the title credited with sparking the idea to call it “perma-culture.” And guess what? Many of the exact ideas Mollison presented in his early books can also be found in the above four books. Read them and see for yourself. He did NOT invent this concept and neither did any of his students! Indeed, throughout his life until he died in , Mollison consistently pointed back to his sources and reiterated that he did not “own” any of these ideas, and that this type of knowledge can not and should not be owned. In all of his work, we see an ethical and practical reliance on a fairly short list of ecological design principles, summarized here from his early writing: We’ll come back around to these principles and many more, but for now can you see how these ideas could help you to design not only a garden and homestead, but also a social and emotional landscape that is more resilient, abundant, and safe than the current (degenerative) systems in which most of us now exist?  Permaculture is a sustainable living methodology aimed at creating harmonious integration between humans and the natural environment. Although some may argue that permaculture has cult-like characteristics, it is essential to analyze its principles and practices to determine its true nature. Permaculture’s focus on sustainable living through Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share distinguishes it from cult-like practices and emphasizes its commitment to creating a regenerative and fairer world. Some misconceptions about it being a cult arise due to its close-knit community and the passionate (and often quite vocal) dedication of its practitioners. However, permaculture’s foundations are grounded in scientific principles and practices. Its approach is based on observing and mimicking natural ecosystems and principles, utilizing renewable resources, and minimizing waste. Contrary to cult-like practices, permaculture emphasizes conscious design and encourages individuals to adapt its principles to their local climate and culture. It is not an exclusive group with a leader but rather a community of like-minded individuals, educators, and designers who share knowledge and promote sustainable living practices. So, while some may perceive the community to be cult-like due to certain patterns of interactions in a few particular areas of the world (and the interwebs) it’s important to remember that there are a huge diversity of people practicing and teaching permaculture, and it’s worth it to look deeper for a niche in the learning community that feels right for your needs. There are certainly a handful of would-be cult leaders in the online permaculture sphere, so it’s a good idea to do your due diligence while looking for a place to learn. While you explore, be mindful and focus on finding a space that keeps its foundations in scientific principles and ethical guidelines, while avoiding spaces that “permavangelize,” or preach permaculture as the “one true path.” Even Bill Mollison, the permaculture teacher who created the Internationally-respected Permaculture Design Course curriculum, consistently advised against becoming dogmatic about it. Permaculture, by definition, defies both ownership and large-scale leadership. Permaculture is a set of actions and strategies based on site-specific, climate-aware, community-invested ecologies. In this sense, leadership beyond the immediate stakeholders is not practical nor is it possible. Permaculture is about personal responsibility, thoughtful action, and careful, ecological design. It is about science, evidence, and results. Your teachers are just the messengers, and a good design needs no teacher’s approval, because a good design validates itself through the integrity of the ecological systems it perpetuates. Like any concept, philosophy, or land-use practice permaculture is not without its flaws and the best permaculture designers are the ones who face these limitations head-on. To a trained permaculture designer, looking at “what permaculture got wrong” is simply another tool for learning how to get it right. One criticism of permaculture is its potential for being overly idealistic and impractical. While permaculture principles aim to mimic natural systems and create harmonious integration, implementing these designs on a larger scale can face challenges. The complex interconnections of natural environments make it difficult to replicate. Furthermore, some critics argue that permaculture can be hard to implement in urban or heavily populated areas, where land availability and regulatory restrictions may pose barriers. The concept of permaculture design, which emphasizes natural materials and closed-loop systems, may not always be feasible or cost-effective in such environments, and can be especially inaccessible to the people who might need it most–the poor. Another area where permaculture has faced criticism is its limited focus on invasive plants and pests. While permaculture aims to create productive ecosystems, the lack of attention to invasive species management can lead to unintended consequences and ecological imbcalance for native plants and animal species. Despite these criticisms and limitations, it is important to recognize that permaculture has achieved success in many instances. The flaws and challenges within permaculture design do not discount its potential as a powerful tool for achieving sustainability and conscious design. It is incumbent upon permaculture designers to continually evolve and adapt the approach to address these limitations and create more effective and resilient systems. There are many places to learn more about becoming an ecological designer. You can learn these skills on any schedule and with any budget, and start applying the concepts in your daily life right away. For the purpose of this article, we’ll provide a quick overview of free and paid options.. Learning permaculture for free is as easy as signing up for the Permaculture for Beginners course online. You’ll be amazed at how much you get and how much you learn, and from there you can follow the recommended resources to an array of learning opportunities for your permaculture research adventure!  If you prefer learning from books, go to your public library and request a copy of any of these books, then read them cover to cover: One of the best ways to get an introduction to permaculture is by joining one of the many online permaculture communities found on social media networks and hosted by permaculture associations around the world. Online permaculture communities provide a platform for individuals to connect with like-minded individuals and share their experiences and knowledge about permaculture. These communities play a crucial role in spreading awareness and facilitating learning and collaboration among enthusiasts of sustainable living. By joining these communities, individuals can learn from the experiences and expertise of others, discover innovative techniques and practices, and stay updated with the latest trends in permaculture. Connecting with like-minded individuals creates a supportive network where members can seek advice, share success stories, and find inspiration for their own projects. The first online permaculture community most people come across is Permies, an active forum with thousands of users and endless lists of comments going back over a decade. Another popular community is the Permaculture Global Network, a platform that enables users to connect with permaculture practitioners worldwide, with more of a professional emphasis. There’s also the Eco Design Hive, a free public forum that offers a marketplace area, a local connections board, and a range of online permaculture courses for students of all levels of experience. You’ll also find a plethora of permaculture groups on Facebook, though these tend to be riddled with trolling and spam, so it’s hit or miss. For a safe bet, check out the groups hosted by the Free Permaculture network. The UI, features, and overall “vibe” of each of these forums is radically different, so explore them all and find a space that feels right for you. A Permaculture Design Course (aka “PDC”), if done correctly, provides students with a life-changing transformation that will forever improve their interactions with the natural world. This course provides a holistic understanding of permaculture principles, design methods, and practical techniques. In-person courses happen all over the world and usually involve camping out in a rural setting and practicing the ideas on a shared design project with a small group of cohorts. The students benefit greatly from the real-time interaction but the most common complaint about these courses is that the students don’t really get a chance to design the place where they actually live. Also, the in-person courses can be terribly expensive to attend, especially once you calculate in the travel expenses, time off work, and so on. Online permaculture design courses are also fairly common, but it can be a bit harder to determine which are offered by legitimate teachers and/or which provide enough support for the student to actually achieve the “permaculture transformation” of both their garden and their mind. Whether online or in-person, most teachers offer a free “Introduction to Permaculture” course, and it’s highly recommended you sample a few of these before making the investment in their full PDC. In general, student feedback about learning permaculture online is exceedingly positive because the students enjoy having the time and space to work on designs that are relevant to their own homes and lives. No two PDCs are alike, and the quality of them varies widely, but they all (should) contain the same basic curriculum to conform with the International guidelines. The easiest way to check and make sure a PDC follows this curriculum is to choose one that has been reviewed by a rd party such as a Permaculture Association. If you go with a course that seems to be run by a lone wolf, your chances of overpaying for a sub-par experience (and missing out on a big transformation) are much higher. To obtain permaculture certification, individuals need to complete a PDC. This course covers various aspects of permaculture, including natural ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, organic gardening, and renewable resources. It equips learners with the skills and knowledge required to apply permaculture principles in their own projects. Permaculture certification is meaningful because it implies that the teacher of that course has interacted with you directly, has reviewed your assignments, and can confirm that you fundamentally understand the core ideas around ecological design. However, it’s important to understand that a “permaculture certificate” is simply a certificate of completion. All it says is that you took the course. The value of any one permaculture certificate over another is arbitrary, because there is no such thing as a central “permaculture certification board” or anything like it. What you will find, instead, is an assortment of regional and international Permaculture Institutes and Associations who work collectively to keep teachers accountable so that the certificates actually mean something. This is another reason to, as mentioned above, seek training with permaculture teachers who indicate they are a member of a Permaculture Association and can demonstrate that their curriculum has been reviewed accordingly. You can certainly find permaculture courses online that offer a certificate but do not provide any feedback about your design work, but you have to take that with a grain of salt. Does this mean you shouldn’t pay the  bucks to watch those  hours of video on Udemy? No! You should for sure watch those videos. Just…don’t stop there. Go and earn your certificate with the support and supervision of a dedicated professional permaculture educator, and you’ll see why it matters. Earning your PDC is a way to make sure you’ve covered all the bases as you assemble your permaculture beginner’s toolkit. You can certainly learn permaculture on your own, from books, and through hands-on practice in your own context. But when you willfully invest in a learning experience that was created by an impassioned teacher, you not only help that teacher keep teaching, you’re also paying into a healthier economy. You’re helping the movement grow and putting your money where your mouth is, so that the next generation of students can do the same. So yes, permaculture certification holds great significance in the permaculture community. It allows individuals to obtain recognition for their expertise in sustainable and regenerative agriculture systems, offering opportunities for professional development, career advancement, and credibility.  For those who have already completed a PDC or have a specific area of interest within permaculture, niche-specific classes are also available. These courses delve deeper into particular topics such as food forests, natural building techniques, or regenerative agriculture. Taking these classes allows you to gain specialized knowledge and skills that can be applied to your own permaculture projects. Whether you choose to pursue a traditional PDC, explore more niche-specific classes, or both, the options for learning permaculture are vast. Take the time to research and find the courses that align with your goals and interests. By investing in your education, you can gain the knowledge and skills needed to create sustainable and regenerative systems in your own backyard or community. Whether you choose to go for permaculture certification or not, learning about permaculture is guaranteed to improve your garden, your home space, and your relationships. Taking a permaculture design course can be a valuable investment for individuals interested in creating sustainable and regenerative systems. These courses provide comprehensive knowledge and practical skills that go beyond traditional gardening or agriculture techniques. But what if you just really don’t have the money? Is it worth it to go into debt to learn permaculture? if you lack the funds to invest in a Permaculture Design Course but you feel that permaculture certification could benefit your personal and/or professional life, you have a couple of options. Many people do a small crowdfunding campaign to ask friends and family for tuition money, sometimes in lieu of holiday or graduation gifts. You can offer design work, after the fact, as rewards to the people who donate to your training. You can also try to find a teacher who is willing to do a work-trade with you in exchange for tuition. this is very common, especially for in-person courses. Contact them well in advance, as these positions tend to fill up quickly. In general, out of all the things you spend your money on, investing in a Permaculture Design Course is unlikely to be at the top of your list of regrets. Most graduates consider it to have been well worth the money for a transformation that would have otherwise perhaps been missed entirely. Go here for an article about different ways to do fundraising, not just for your education but also for your permaculture projects now and in the future. Here’s the point where I could give you a rundown of the top-rated online permaculture design courses, but really I just want to tell you to enroll in mine! It’s the culmination of  years of experience and I created it to address what I see as the shortcomings of the other online programs (namely, that they are too focused on people who own big land and inaccessible to the rest of us!) So here it is: Our Online Permaculture Design Course offers rolling enrollment, so you can go at your own pace, and finish within a few months or take up to a year. We give you a template and walk you through creating your own, actionable permaculture plan. But more importantly: we make sure you experience the mindset transformation that makes permaculture so powerful. Through our streamlined, accessible curriculum and ongoing support through both public and private forums, our program is designed to help you really “get it” as an ecological designer, quickly, without getting bogged down in dogma or utopian fantasy. Our course is practical and focused on helping normal working folks (who don’t own big land or have tons of money) take daily action towards a more sustainable life.   This beautiful documentary explores some of the ideas about where permaculture techniques came from and reminds us how much we can learn from some indigenous cultures, about caring for nature.

"(Updated Sept ) This is an evolving resource base, curating links, reviews, and tutorials for the best beginner-friendly landscape design apps. by Heather Jo Flores A landscape design app is a software tool designed to help landscapers, designers, and homeowners create and visualize new landscape layouts. It allows users to experiment with different design elements such as plants, water features, and hardscapes to bring their outdoor spaces to life. The interfaces tend to be user-friendly and intuitive, so you don’t need to be a tech whiz to get started. For industry professionals, these apps are more than just a design tool. They’re a platform for showcasing your work and collaborating with clients. You can produce detailed D designs that give clients a clear picture of what their future outdoor space could look like. But you don’t have to be a landscape professional to find these apps useful. Whether you’re looking to create a dream garden or just spruce up your yard, the app allows you to experiment with various design elements. You can browse through real-life plant photos for inspiration and even find the perfect plants for specific areas of your garden. Here’s how and why: Basically, adopting software for permaculture designs is not just a modern convenience; it’s a practical choice that enhances efficiency, fosters creativity, and simplifies collaboration. Whether you’re a seasoned permaculture designer or a homeowner looking to transform your outdoor space, digital tools can make the process so much easier! Digital Permaculture tools can be helpful for mapping “invisible” layers as well, such as in this example mapping where ethics and principles show up in the design. There are a few categories of software tools that we commonly use for designing and planning permaculture projects. Each of these tools serves a unique purpose in helping designers visualize, analyze, and create sustainable and productive landscapes. (p.s. these are not affiliate links! If you think we should be compensated for providing this information, please make a donation. Thanks!) Let’s take a closer look at each of these categories of tools. Geographic Information System (GIS) software, such as QGIS, is a powerful tool that allows permaculture designers to work with spatial data and create detailed maps. With GIS software, you can analyze geographical information, overlay different data layers, and visualize site features in relation to each other. This is particularly useful for mapping permaculture zones, sectors, soil types, and topography. GIS software enables you to make informed decisions based on accurate geographical data. Here are the  free GIS options rated highest for user-friendliness: CAD software, including well-known platforms like AutoCAD and SketchUp, empowers permaculture designers to create intricate site plans, landscape designs, and structural layouts. CAD software is especially valuable for translating design concepts into detailed visual representations. Permaculturists can adapt CAD tools to showcase garden layouts, plant placements, pathways, and structures. This level of detail aids in precise implementation and effective communication of design ideas. Here is a list of free CAD softwares, ranked by how well rated they are for user-friendliness: When it comes to permaculture design, especially for beginners, the choice of software can make a significant difference in the ease and effectiveness of the design process. Traditional CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software is powerful but often comes with a steep learning curve. It’s generally more suited for professionals in fields like architecture and engineering, who require a high level of detail and precision. So, before we get into the list of landscape design apps, consider these reasons why they might be a better choice for beginners: While CAD software has its merits, its complexity and cost can be barriers for beginners. The apps listed above offer a more accessible entry point into the world of permaculture design, with features tailored to the specific needs and challenges of this unique approach to landscaping and agriculture. And, although we all wish there was a software named “Permaculture Design,” there are several landscape design apps that offer user-friendly interfaces, plant libraries, and drag-and-drop features to simplify the process of designing outdoor spaces. They are particularly useful for creating garden layouts, exploring plant options, and visualizing how elements will interact within the landscape. Whether you are looking for landscape design apps for Mac, PC, or your mobile device, here is an exhaustive list of the top-rated landscape design apps: Afraid of computers? For those who might be more accustomed to hands-on practices or who haven’t worked with digital tools before, the prospect of using software for permaculture design can feel a bit overwhelming. Do not despair! We sourced a list of the top five landscape design apps that are known to be more user-friendly and easy to learn: (Pro-tip: USE THE TUTORIALS!–Almost all of these apps have extensive learning resources for you.) While these apps may not be specifically tailored for landscape or permaculture design, they offer invaluable support in various aspects of your projects. From crafting visually engaging materials to efficient project management and collaboration, these apps cover a broad spectrum of needs. The best part? Most of these tools are either free or super cheap. We broke this section down into a few categories: These apps streamline the design process, saving you time and effort that can be better spent in the garden or on the land. They also enable you to create more precise and well-thought-out plans, making the most of limited resources. Using landscape design apps doesn’t mean you have to abandon the hand-drawn approach! Some of the most beautiful designs use a combination of analog and digital design tools. Tools like Canva make it easy to combine your drawings and digital formats so you can share your work more widely (ahem, rd ethic). Check out this gallery of Permaculture Design Course alumni designs for many gorgeous examples of designs that fall all along the tech complexity spectrum. It’s free, it’s magical, and it might be the only app you need for permaculture design. We host the template for our online Permaculture Design Course on Canva, and students love it! Canva is primarily a graphic design app. However, with even just the free version of Canva you can: Here’s an example of using Canva to create plant folios, like you might do in a permaculture design: We’re living in a fascinating time where biology and technology are coming together in ways we never thought possible. It’s a lot, and permies are, by nature, wary of technology. But in my humble opinion, access to advanced technologies such as landscape design apps is a practical advantage for permaculture designers. These apps save you time by offering efficient planning tools, from D models to plant libraries. Time saved on planning can be time spent in the garden, hands in the soil, observing and interacting with your ecosystem. The biological features of these apps, like plant identification, help you make ecologically sound choices quickly. This isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about creating sustainable, functional landscapes. The more precise your plan, the more effectively you can use limited resources, whether that’s space, water, or your own labor. I definitely sometimes worry that technology could disconnect us from nature or overwhelm us with data. But used wisely, these tools can actually bring us closer to our permaculture goals. They allow for more precise planning, which in turn leads to more effective implementation. If the idea of using AI tools makes you uneasy, consider this: these tools can make your designs more accurate and your implementation more efficient. AI can help with everything from soil analysis to weather prediction, offering insights that can make your permaculture projects more resilient and sustainable. Use it to fine-tune your plans, save time, and make the most of your resources. The end goal is always to create sustainable systems, and these tools are here to help us achieve that. I made this video to open up some more conversation about ai, and how we could perhaps use these new tools to help us save time, leverage learning experiences, and make the least change for the greatest effect so we can spend more time in the garden and less time in repetitive cycles:  Yes, I am pro-technology at this moment. Integrate rather than segregate. Leverage change, Make use of available resources. Understand the edges. Capture the surplus. To jump into the dialogue I mention in the video, go here. And if you’re interested in learning permaculture, with educators who understand the modern barriers to land access and permaculture in practice, go here. All of that being said, check out these absolutely amazing AI tools for permaculture! A bit more about doing landscape design apps on your iPad. Whether you work with Apple or Windows, if you have a tablet device that works with a digital pencil, a whole world opens up for you as a designer. The iPad with Apple Pencil is an AMAZING tool for permaculture design. (psst this video is sort of old but I still use a lot of these tools so I’m leaving it up even though we radically updated the rest of this article.) –I also found another ipad permaculture video on the youtubes so I linked that down below. Landscape Design and Permaculture Garden Drawing with Your iPad Permaculture gardens are aesthetically pleasing because they combine plants that attract butterflies, birds, bees, and other beneficial insects. I found this this helpful article entitled “Smartphone Apps that will make you a better Permaculture Designer.” Here is another small directory of gardening apps for further exploration. Once you’ve got your apps picked out and have started getting comfortable with digital tools in general, you’re ready to watch some tutorials. We’ve assembled an evolving collection of tutorials on using landscape design apps to create permaculture designs, and they come from a wide range of sources. Some videos will appeal more to you than others, and that’s the idea! Systems thinking resources (brain tools to make you a better designer!) Soil mapping has been around for quite some time and is now all digitalized thanks to Google Earth for Farmers which allows farmers to plan ahead by allowing them to see where to plant their crops. With Google Earth for Farmers mapping solution it is possible to find out where a farm is and then add other information to that image like water levels, soil and capacity of landscapes, You can use Google Earth Pro desktop version for free. It may take a bit of practice to learn how to import multiple data sets into Google Earth, but once you’ve done so, you can begin using them to evaluate soil types across an entire region. Google Earth for Farmers: Drawing and Measure Tools Google Earth is an extremely useful tool for farmers. It can help them survey their fields, scout crops, apply fertilizer at different rates, and measure yield. Farmers must gather all the relevant data into one location, so they can use it to decide which crops to plant and where to plant them. They can then use Google Earth layers to combine topographic map, soil types, and other tools to help them plan their planting strategy. Permaculture gardening focuses on creating healthy ecosystems by using techniques such as companion planting, intercropping, biointensive crop production, polyculture, and integrated pest management. It’s all about designing systems that mimic nature. This helps us to use less resources, produce more food, and make better use of our land. In this video, John Trefethen demonstrates the Permaculture garden design that he has assembled, and how to create overlays. In an effort to make the production workflow easier, Daniel Halsey shows how he has standardized the size of all his plant labels, so they can easily be scaled down to fit any project. In this video by Localscapes, you can see how to use Google Maps to create a base map for your property. Dan Halsey of United Designers and Pete Widin of the The Epic Ecopreneur review a . acre suburban permaculture design. They cover some project background, design considerations, and get deep into the way the project plan is displayed and how the layers are working in Illustrator. In this video, Sustainable Survival gives a brief explanation on how to utilize Sketchup and Google Earth to make a contour map for a property to help in permaculture garden design. This brief tutorial by Canadian Renegade shows how to make topographic maps of your property using ArcGIS Pro. These maps can be used to get a better understanding of the water and energy flows on a property and give a different perspective than you get from the ground.

Nothing on this website is presented as any sort of medical advice, and if you’re bleeding, in intense pain, or otherwise concerned about an undiagnosed set of symptoms, for cryin’ out loud, go to a doctor! The internet is a place to learn and interact, not to replace the help of a qualified professional. The same goes for herbalism. You can learn a lot of basic skills on your own, but to truly unveil the magic of plants, you’ll do well to find qualified experts to work with, who will help you make informed choices about your own healing and/or teaching journeys. All plants are medicinal, in some way, to someone. This is a pharmacy, an apothecary: AND SO IS THIS: AND SO IS THIS: BUT ALSO THIS: AND FOR SURE THIS TOO: Your food is either healing you, or it’s making you sick. There is no neutral. That being said, some plants are more medicinal than others, especially when it comes to establishing your own herbal apothecary for home remedies, nourishing teas, and first aid. Here are my own “Top ” medicinal plants I ALWAYS grow, no matter where I am living. And here’s an excellent guide to common medicinal plants.

"“Evolution is no linear family tree, but change in the single multidimensional being that has grown to cover the entire surface of Earth.”― Lynn Margulis “Work with nature, rather than against it.” – every successful organic gardener, ever.  Please take a half-hour to watch this lecture: Fifteen years ago, when I wrote Food Not Lawns covering matters such as permaculture biodiversity, lawns covered  million acres of land in the USA. Now, they cover  million acres. Since then, the human population on this planet has increased by almost %. Yet the amount of forest ecosystems on the planet has continued to decrease by millions of acres every year. ​ By definition, by our ethics, and by the very laws of nature, in order for an ecological design to succeed, we have to remove ourselves from the throne. We have to make the conscious choice for humanity’s needs to be on equal ground with the needs of other species. Fortunately, this is the ecological default. We just have to stop working against nature. We have to embrace the fact that, in order for our own species to survive, we have to build an active perpetuation of others into our dedicated daily life-patterns. And yes, your food forest, however small it may seem, matters! In fact, at this point in time, our survival as a species depends entirely on how quickly we can stop global deforestation and regenerate what we’ve destroyed so far. So your gardens, as many as you can grow, for the rest of your life, are more important than ever. The threat of cataclysm is a huge and heavy truth, but it helps to understand that biodiversity isn’t a goal or something we can get. It isn’t the destination. The destination is life. Permaculture biodiversity is the vehicle that makes the destination attainable at all. And the easiest, fastest way to get behind the wheel? Gardening! Whether you live on a farm or in an apartment in the city, you need plants. Plants provide almost all our food and vast amounts of our fuel, fiber, and medicine. Plants filter the air and water and help bind together the cycles of the earth.  Learning about plants inspires an instinctual, natural awareness that leads to increased creativity and mental and physical healing. Plants provide opportunities. The more diverse the plants, the more diverse the opportunities.  And, as with everything else, the designer limits the yield. The more different and diverse permaculture biodiversity is, and interconnected you can design your varied biodiversity permaculture gardens to be, the more they will contribute to the larger ecosystems of which they (and you) are a part. There are many different types of gardens that can interconnect in your permaculture design, and they can all be designed in ways that increase permaculture biodiversity. Where they connect, varied types of gardens will createpermaculture edges and microclimates!  If you’ve done any gardening at all, you’ve encountered weeds. Whether you pull the weeds and compost them, mulch over them, or both, removing the competition, so your selected plants can thrive is a huge part of agriculture, and needn’t be a struggle. However, some plants grow a little faster, and can earn labels like “invasive.” Weeds, “invasive” plants, and exotics that are struggling to survive in a climate they haven’t evolved to endure all have something in common: they’re growing in a place that is inappropriate for what that plant needs in order to thrive in easy harmony with the plants around. Identifying the potential “special needs” of certain plants, whether already onsite or on their wish-list, means designers can more adeptly decide where to place those plants, or whether to bring them onsite at all.  This approach sidesteps the “invasive” argument altogether and simply assesses whether you’re willing to take responsibility for the needs of the plants you propagate.​ You will also need to learn certain skills, such as when to provide extra water and nutrients, protecting from extreme temperatures, hand-pollinating for fruit production, learning how to create and make the best use of microclimates, and more. And, while these pursuits are often part of a permaculture gardener’s life in general, and can surely be super fun and fascinating, it’s essential that you consider these details – and permaculture biodiversity altogether – while developing your whole-system design. There are  categories of special needs plants in this illustration, and some plants will fit into several at once. The more plants you have that could be called “special needs” plants, the more maintenance your gardens will require.

" An ecovillage is small or midsize eco-friendly community of people who strive to create a sustainable and ecologically friendly lifestyle by minimizing their impact on the environment, utilizing renewable energy sources, and growing their own food Residents share resources, work together, and learn from each other. This can help foster a sense of community and make living more sustainable easier. The stuff permaculture dreams are made of, an ecovillage could be the goal of your design project, it could be one small part of it, or it could be something you want to learn about but not necessarily live in. There are a lot of different ways to create living communities that make sense for permaculture people, and this article is about exploring those options! ​An ecovillage is a whole-systems design. All the same principles apply. In  easy steps? As it is obvious, each of these steps will need a lot of time, energy, and understanding! It’s real easy to say “I want build an ecovillage,” but the very best way to become adept at these skills you will need to build one is by spending some years living in one (or several). Here are  very different video examples:  The first ecovillage was established in Denmark in the s. Since then, more than , eco-communities have been built around the world. They can be found in most countries and are often concentrated in areas with a high population of sustainability enthusiasts. Ecovillages are built in a range of settings from urban to rural. Although there are no official statistics on how many are currently in existence, there is a growing interest in this type of community, because many people are drawn to the idea of living a simpler and more environmentally friendly lifestyle.

 Once you’ve designed the water system, the next step is to build a closed-loop soil fertility system, using compost, cover crops, and a variety of homespun concoctions to improve structure, feed microorganisms, and promote a thriving, evolving soil food web. Whether you find yourself on a site where the soil is damaged and depleted, or you’ve got amazing soil that you want to keep fertile, learning how to create and maintain healthy soil is a crucial part of the permaculture process. There is a whole world in the dirt that we can’t see with the naked eye, upon which all life on Earth depends in so many ways. Healthy soil, much like a healthy human body, contains a whole ecosystem of flora and fauna. This video, a classic film from Japan, shows us the many layers of life that exist in healthy soil, and demonstrates the lack of life in soil that has been mistreated with chemicals and monocropping. This section is by Lichen June Plants are active participants in the vibrant and diverse community of soil food web. There are more than  million genera of bacteria in the soil, and more than  million genera of fungi. Humans haven’t named more than a small percentage, and we know very little about those which we have named. Thus, the vast majority of life in the soil, along with their relationships and functions, are unnamed and unknown. By some accounts, humans have destroyed -% of earth’s topsoil. I find this so troubling, I almost don’t know what to write next. However, this is a very clear case of “the problem is the solution.” There is so much land devoid of life, so many layers and niches just waiting to be filled with diversity, life cycles, and carbon. Soil is an incredible and established reservoir that is ready to hold carbon, if only we nurture it back to life. ​One method for improving the health of your soil is adding compost. Your food is only as healthy as the soil that it was grown in, so you’ll want to give your soil biota something good to eat.  This recipe is a variation of the -day Berkley method, and can teach you the basics. As you gain more experience, you can change the recipe. The greater variety of matter you put into your compost, the richer your soil food web becomes. You’ll need - parts carbon to  part nitrogen. Some examples: If you can increase surface area by chopping or shredding, it will speed up decomposition. You will need a lot of materials. Don’t go over  feet high, or it will squeeze the air out. You can use a gravity fall pile, or a piece of wire fence. You’ll need a long handled pitchfork with - prongs, a rake, and a cover to maintain moisture. You need / of your materials to be manure, / high carbon material, or browns, and / fresh greens. Pitch them all together and mix them up. Then water the hill until it starts to leak water. If you have food scraps, those can be incorporated into the layers and covered. Avoid materials that have come into contact with pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, antibiotic medications, and anything that will take your pH to one extreme or another. Once you’re more familiar with this recipe, you can put an activator in the middle when you start the pile. These could include dead animals, fish, chopped comfrey, yarrow, nettle, or old compost. You have to be certain that you know your recipe, so your pile will cook and not go putrid. Some people urinate on their compost piles to increase the nitrogen. Some add menstrual blood as an activator. Other common activators, by % of Nitrogen: Once you have built your pile, you will want to cover it if you are expecting rain. Place branches on top of the pile to hold the cover off the surface, allowing air to pass through. You can also build the pile inside to heat a greenhouse. If conditions are very hot, place your pile in the shade. If you want to look at your compost activity under a microscope, put a handful of compost in a jar with water and shake for  minutes. Then get a pipette and drop one drop on a slide, under a cover sheet, to view under the microscope. Take five minutes to look at this, and you will see thousands of organisms every second. Carbon is more of a fungal food. Nitrogen is more of a bacterial food. Non-woody plants and pasture prefer bacteria rich soil. Trees prefer fungal/carbon rich soil. Flour, paper, cardboard are all fungal food. If you want more fungi in your compost, you can add something like oat flour on every turn. You can test the temperature of your pile with a good quality compost thermometer. If the pile is hotter on the inside than the outside, then your pile is too dry. If your pile is hotter on the outside than the inside, then your pile is too wet. Compost kept between  –  degrees for  days will kill pathogens, parasites and weed seeds. If you want to speed up the compost turning process, you can turn your pile every day for  to  days and get it done faster, but it will be more work. Make sure you put the outer layer in the center when turning your pile, and the inner layer on the surface. Day one: Create the pile. Day four: turn it over, ideally putting the outer layers in the middle and the center on the surface, as you move and rebuild the pile. Replace branches and cover. Day six: turn. Day eight: Turn every two days. How do you know if the moisture in your pile is adequate? Squeeze a handful of the matter from the compost pile. If one drop falls, it is perfect. More water than that, and the pile is too wet. No drops, and it is too dry. The pile should also be very warm. If you put a glove on and push your arm into the pile up to your elbow, it shouldn’t be so hot that you say “Ow.” Turn the pile on day ten, day twelve, day fourteen, day sixteen and by day eighteen it should be done. When it is just warm, dark brown, fine with only a few chunks, and an earthy smell, not putrid, then it is done. How do you fix problems with your compost recipe? If you get to day  or  and your compost is not hot enough, ask yourself: If it is high enough and wet enough, then you don’t have enough nitrogen. Get some convenient nitrogen and spread it into the pile on each turn, such as blood and bone meal, rich manure, or molasses. You have probably lost - days, or rather, you will have to turn the pile for - extra days. If the pile is too wet, you’ve got to put a hole in the center with your pitchfork handle and place a chimney in the middle to let it steam off. If it is too dry, just water it. If you have too much nitrogen, it will lose volume fast and smell very bad. Carbon is your sponge and carbon will slow it down. If your compost goes a little anaerobic in places for lack of air, it will present a white, moldy looking powder. That is the first indicator that you’ve gone over the line in temperature or moisture and need to make an adjustment. You want  compost heaps to an acre if you want to kick off an organic crop garden system. Your soil will hold more water at the end of this process. When you get skilled at turning your pile, you can do it in  minutes. That’s  hours of work total for this  day recipe. One compost heap this size, spread around a garden, will grow vegetables for one year, for one person.  Turning a pile every two days is not for everyone. If you are too busy, you can turn your pile once every - days. At that rate your compost will be finished in - months. If you need to go more slowly, that’s okay. You can always assess what your compost needs are when you turn it, and add accordingly. Alternately, you can make an add as you go pile. This requires even less effort, as there is no need to separate your kitchen waste, yard debris, and clippings. Unfortunately, it decomposes at a slower rate of - months. It is prone to odor problems because the lack of turning allows it to go anaerobic. It doesn’t heat up well, which means it does not kill weed seeds and pathogens. It will be less nutrient dense. It might attract pests if uncovered. If you mix your sieved compost with sharp river sand from the inside bends of creeks or rivers, you can make your own potting mix. The smaller the seed the more sand you want in the mix, for example, carrot seeds, etc. With large seeds you can use / compost and sand.​ You can also extend your compost by making compost tea.

"Biomimicry is a scientific discipline that studies the creative process of imitating nature’s methods and systems to solve human problems. It is not a new concept: examples of it have been found as far back as the ancient Mayan culture, and its principles have been applied in various sectors since the s. It can be applied to various areas, including design, architecture, engineering, ecology, and sustainability. In the design field, it involves studying and replicating nature’s examples of efficient, sustainable, and elegant design. As such, it is a great tool for those who are interested in sustainable design. With this approach, permaculture designers look to nature for examples of sustainable practices and then try to replicate them. Why is biomimicry relevant? All things that exist are made of the same basic patterns, and we can use those patterns to understand, interact with, and mimic nature, so that our homes, gardens, and lifestyles are more sustainable. When designing with biomimicry, the core goal is to create sustainable solutions by learning from the examples of nature. Creating sustainable solutions can be done in a variety of ways, including: The goal of this article is to help you become acquainted also with the core set of patterns that make up all matter, on every scale of the known universe, and to explore ways we can mimic, understand, and adapt to those patterns on every scale of our permaculture design project. Biomimicry has the potential to revolutionize the way we view and interact with the natural environment, by learning from nature’s examples and applying them to our own lives. By following the principles of biomimicry and permaculture design, we can create nature-inspired solutions that are both effective and sustainable. There are so many wonderful videos about this topic online already, so rather than make something repetitive, we’ve picked a few of our favorites to share. In this sweet, simple overview, Amy Lamb shows the common recurring patterns in nature that make up all things. Alan Turing was less famous than Einstein or Tesla, but his study of patterns changed the way humans see, study, and interact with nature. ​In a permaculture context, we study biomimicry to help understand how we can apply natural patterns to our whole systems design. Here’s an excellent short article to introduce the concept. Here’s a fun animation about biomimicry, from the folks at Sustainability Illustrated. Biomimicry can be used by anyone interested in creating a sustainable lifestyle, and to address a variety of issues such as food security, water scarcity, and climate change. It can also be applied to areas such as sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture, and sustainable energy. Since permaculture is a holistic design approach that aims to create sustainable and productive ecosystems that mimic natural systems and apply biomimicry, the two fields can be used together to create effective and sustainable solutions for living. When applied to a specific area, such as sustainable agriculture, it can help to create sustainable solutions. For example, when growing plants hydroponically, one can use biomimicry to create a natural fertilizer by mimicking compost with a mixture of worms and vegetable scraps! For those who are interested in using the principles of biomimicry in permaculture design, it is important to select the area or focus of your design. It is also important to select the right examples of nature-inspired solutions. ​This time, we’re hunting for patterns in nature!

Niche biology is a field of biology that focuses on the study of how organisms interact with one another and their environment. It looks at the roles, interactions, and relationships between species, their habitats, and the resources that they rely on for survival. It also examines the structure of ecological communities and the impact of environmental change on species and ecosystems. In permaculture, the eco niche is defined as the relationship between species and their environment. Niche biology is the study of how species interact with their environment, including how they compete for resources, how they cooperate and how they evolve in response to changes in their environment. These two concepts are closely linked in permaculture, as the study of niche biology can help individuals design effective and sustainable permaculture systems. An eco-niche includes all interactions with the biotic and abiotic factors of its environment.  A niche is an opportunity.​ In business, the word niche is used often, and it’s a well-known fact that writers and most other creatives need one in order to be financially successful. In that context, niche refers to products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. And if you do a search for niche blogging, you’ll open a wormhole filled with people in every corner of the multiverse.  In science, an ecological niche has a deeper definition, which includes the role and position a species has in its environment, how it meets its needs for food and shelter, how it survives, and how it reproduces. Check out this helpful article, about eco-niche analysis in a permaculture setting. And this one, about having an eco-niche for your permaculture business. In the permaculture community, however, it’s very common to be a generalist and to have this “save the world”, “save everybody” attitude. And while that’s sort of a beautiful notion, it’s not very attainable. It’s not measurable. When you try to do everything and help everybody at once, it’s very easy to dilute your work into a watered down, generalist approach, that might be inspiring and helpful on some levels, but is unlikely to bring in much in the way of specific rewards for you as an individual. But if you can find your eco-niche, as a member of the permaculture community, and also as the creative and unique individual that you are, and bring forth ideas, products, and services that solve problems for a specific group of people, you can have a huge impact on their lives, bring in big rewards for yourself, and free up more time and resources for helping non-human species too! Take a moment to imagine the myriad of ways you could turn your passion into a profession… Going green has become a priority in our society today, and starting a sustainable business can be a great way to do your part in helping the environment. Whether you are looking to start a business from scratch or convert an existing business to be more sustainable, there are many eco-niche examples that can inspire you to get started. Here are a few eco-niche examples to help you get started on your green journey: Organic farming is a great way to begin your sustainable business journey. It focuses on using natural techniques to grow produce, without the use of synthetic chemicals or GMOs. With organic farming, you can grow a wide variety of products, from fruits and vegetables, to eggs and dairy. You can find your niche within organic farming by growing a specific crop, like strawberries. If you own a farm, you can also provide an on-site marketplace for your produce, and sell to both consumers and restaurants. Sustainable agriculture is a big category that can be more specific to your location. Sustainable agriculture businesses can include growing traditional crops, like wheat, or they can focus on growing specialty crops, like mushrooms. If you are growing specialty crops, you will likely need to work with a permaculture designer to create a new sustainable growing method. Composting and gardening services are great ways to make a living while helping the environment. As a permaculture designer, you can help people create sustainable gardens without using synthetic chemicals. Composting services can also provide rich soil for gardens, and vermicomposting is a great way to compost indoors. You can sell compost and soil to individuals, and you can provide gardening services for both individuals and businesses. Eco-friendly cleaning products are a great example of an eco-niche that utilizes your passion for the environment, and creating a business around them is a great way to reduce your personal carbon footprint. You can sell your cleaning products to individuals or businesses, and you can even offer your cleaning services while selling your eco-friendly cleaning products. You can also choose to specialize in a specific type of cleaning product, or you can go a more general route and sell cleaning kits for different types of cleaning tasks. Long before “permaculture” was a thing, farmers knew that finding an eco-niche was a great way to make farming a much more viable profession. Here are some videos with very interesting case studies: If you’re doing any sort of freelance work, or running a business, or even just running a community project that you want other people to know about, you need to learn something about marketing.

" Today our focus is on you, the designer, and on setting clear, actionable goals for your permaculture design project.​ Setting goals for permaculture design projects is super important, but sometimes this task is easier said than done! Here are some tools to help you: Working through a set of questions and receiving feedback from stakeholders in your project will help you clarify your own goals as well as develop an idea of what you can realistically hope to achieve with the project. Check out this article about interviewing stakeholders, and use the sample below to create your own, then conduct interviews of yourself and the other people who will be involved in your project. Sample Interview Questionnaire on setting goals for permaculture design projects by Jude Hobbs (she was Heather Jo’s first teacher) When we start out as permaculture designers, there is a natural urge to rush it. Draw a map, scribble out some interconnected permaculture project ideas, and start digging!​ But… don’t. Make time to get your goals and priorities crystal clear. Inhale. Study. Refine. Revel. And create a set of SMARTER goals.  SMARTER stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound, Ecological, and Rewarding. SMARTER goals are an important strategy for taking your goals and translating them into a plan. As you refine your goals, you’ll need to refer back to your ethical commitments, and consider the biological, socioeconomic, and personal/emotional costs and benefits, should these goals be accomplished. ​This brings us to tool #: In order to create a permaculture design, we have to become permaculture designers, and that means changing the way we view and interact with the world around us, starting with our attitude. It’s not the only factor to consider; but it’s the easiest one to change.​ You’ll see the term, “attitudinal principles” in a lot of the permaculture literature, but it’s a bit of a misnomer; it’s not so much that there are clear lines between biological principles, socioeconomic principles, and attitudinal principles, but more so that all of these layers exist in all of the principles. Imagine a seed, sprouting into a tiny baby plant. Think of the metamorphosis of your goals, into the planned set of actions (aka your permaculture design project), which transforms your goals into tangible, edible reality. When setting goals for permaculture design projects, every action you take has biological, socioeconomic, and emotional impacts and factors to consider. What happens if you consider each of your goals in life, through this lens? It ends up looking a lot like those permaculture ethics, yes? Biological factors connect to Earth care; socioeconomic factors connect to people care; and emotional factors connect to how adeptly we can share fairly and care for the future. So, while there are several permaculture principles, including but in no way limited to the list below, that are commonly referred to as “attitudinal”, keep in mind the above-mentioned factors and see how many ways you can apply ALL the principles towards cultivating the sharpest, most adept designer’s mind you can muster! Here’s a list of five of the most common attitudinal principles in the permaculture lexicon. Without further explanation, how would you interpret these? Can you see how they could help you shift your attitude, and perhaps open up new possibilities when setting goals for permaculture design projects?

 In permaculture we use the terms “whole systems design,” and “whole system design” (no s) interchangeably, to describe the overarching approach we use to make sense of a project. It is what it sounds like it is: a design that includes your whole system. Your system, your garden’s system, your water supply’s system, your climate’s system, your economic and social systems, and so on.  Permaculture is a design science, and in order to use if effectively, we have to become systems thinkers, and cultivate a designer’s mind. The purpose of today’s class is to open those doors for you. Here’s a mini-lecture about whole systems design (please forgive my primitive animations!) Close your eyes and imagine your own “whole system.” It’s easy to let it overwhelm you, to get lost in huge fantasies of what you will do…one day when you win the lottery and buy a huge farm. Don’t do that. Be here now, Sister bear! Part of what makes permaculture so special is that it provides us with a tangible framework around which to plan and implement whole systems designs in real life, on any scale. ​ How do we do this, you ask? On your permaculture journey, you will encounter a multitude of complex ideas and expandable, exponentially powerful concepts. This can be a joyful ride, even when it’s overwhelming and confusing! However, if you’re anything like me, you enjoy a bit of structure now and then.  A permaculture whole systems design can be simplified into four basic parts: I wrote about GOBRADIME in my book, Food Not Lawns, which you now can read for free! Permaculture practitioners also use other processes besides GOBRADIME, such as Looby MacNamara’s design web. But since GOBRADIME is my jam, that’s what we will use in this course.

" What is permaculture sector analysis? With sector analysis in permaculture, the term sector refers to any natural or uncontrolled influence that moves through your design site. And through sector analysis, you can anticipate and enact design decisions that will mediate, mitigate, and improve how those uncontrolled influences affect your site. Sectors could be wind, water, weather… they can be economic, social, biological, or any combination of the above. Every sector has needs, resources, yields, wastes, and relationships that influence the whole system. A work-zone is a sector, with uses, yields, and wastes. A children’s play area is a sector, and has needs and resources associated with it. The cold, moldy side of the basement is a sector (AND permaculture microclimates – we’ll get to that in this article), with opportunities intrinsic (mushrooms, anyone?)​“Invisible structures” are mostly sectors as well, and so is your “inner landscape.” Every site, no matter where you are, has a complex labyrinth of sectors to consider when making choices about your design. Permaculture sector analysis will help you identify microclimates and discover opportunities that weren’t obvious at first glance. The more you know, the better decisions you can make. This section by Pippa Buchanan The potential for disaster happens when systems can not handle extremes or cumulative stress. One week of limited spending may be a challenge, but a medical bill on top of long-term debt and structural poverty may force a family into homelessness. Water is essential for life, but the extremes of either drought or flood-causing torrential rain can cause havoc in both natural and human systems. Designing land, the built environment, lifestyles, livelihoods and organizations to deal with extremes as well as everyday conditions is essential for resilience. There are many ways in which permaculture design and practice supports resilience, but in order to do that, it is important to understand what extremes are most likely to have an impact. This is why careful observation and permaculture sector analysis is so important for a successful project. Permaculture sector analysis is a critical tool for visually representing observations about the “sectors” or external forces and elements that move through or otherwise influence your project. The sectors you record can be related to effects on the site caused by climate, ecology, geology, topography and society. For example, sun paths, wind and rain patterns, invasive plants, wildlife, pollution, neighbors, areas of high fire threat, views and noise could all be recorded on your sector analysis layer. Sectors are often represented as labelled wedges, arcs or arrows representing the origin and direction of the element. However, rocky areas, contaminated soil, boggy land, or areas of flood risk are better represented as location specific patches over your permaculture base map. Some uncontrollable issues such as geological instability or limiting factors such as legal restrictions are harder to represent visually and are best recorded in writing. Part of developing a Designer’s Mind is about making observations free of bias. The forces recorded on a sector analysis are neutral and can be both beneficial or harmful. For example, knowing that dry summer winds come from the east helps identify the best place to locate a laundry line or to hang produce for drying. At the same time, that drying wind will quickly evaporate water from soil as well as dams or ponds. This information guides the placement of windbreak plantings or hedges on the eastern side to moderate the impact of the wind and reduce evaporation. Used together with tools such as zone analysis and common permaculture design principles, sector analysis helps guide the placement of components so that they make the best use of or mitigate the risks of that sector. Permaculture sector analysis influences which zones are placed where, but at the same time, zones influence the strategies used to respond to external forces. In outer zones such as  or , lower cost, less energy intensive solutions such as windbreak plantings are used to slow the wind. Closer to the home (permaculture zone  and permaculture zone ), more intensive solutions such as walls or use of gray water might be used to protect water-demanding plants, animals and people from a drying wind. You should make a sector analysis for your overarching project, and you should also make analyses for sub-designs such as high intensity vegetable beds that include smaller scale microclimate influences like the impact of trees casting shade. Working on sector analysis is a great way to review and incorporate the ideas from everything else you’ve been seeing and learning. Your sector analysis should help you identify the risks, or major extremes that will threaten the longevity of your design projects whether they be fire, flood, drought or legal challenges.

"Barnyard birds add character and entertainment to the homestead, eat weeds and slugs, and sift and manure our leaf-mulch for us before we add it to the garden beds. Interacting with these and the other animals on our farm brings us closer to nature and brings our farm closer to a closed-loop fertility cycle.  However, if we try to add birds to a site, with big fantasies about all the abundance they bring, but without integrating serious considerations for the time, money, and other inputs those birds require, disaster and disappointment could easily ensue. Adding domestic birds – such as chickens in Permaculture farms – to a garden whether urban or rural, brings in life, fertility, and beauty. These benefits can help bring an average garden closer to paradise, but they are sometimes offset by the (often unforeseen) difficulties with these birds. Birds are smelly and dusty, and even a small flock will ruin a nice garden within a few minutes, given the opportunity. Here’s a quick-reference chart of the pros and cons of barnyard birds to help you decide.  Pros Comfortable in a small coop or “chicken tractor.” Steady flow of eggs. They will weed an established perennial garden or spread mulch. They are tameable, trainable, and quite smart.  Cons Very noisy! And not just the roosters! Even the hens, from dawn to dusk, all day, every day. They scratch up baby plants if let loose in a young garden. Easily killed by natural predators. Pros They eat slugs and snails. Eggs are big and delicious. Ducks are funny to watch and quite sociable, and they come in at least as many varieties as chickens.​ Cons Ducks are fairly stupid, so it can be difficult to get them to go where you want. They love to eat salad and will trash your garden badly. It also bears mentioning that male ducks are prone to gang-raping females. So, there’s that. Pros Beautiful, graceful birds, geese are my favorite. The young goslings are very easy to tame. Goose eggs are edible and very rich, and the hard shells last forever when painted.  Cons They poop a LOT, so if they’re free-range, it can get nasty real fast. They can also be aggressive if not handled when young and they will bite you—hard! Pros Delicious and nutritious, and you get a lot of meat from each bird. You also get tons of gorgeous feathers, even if your turkeys are just for pets and insect control. Cons Turkeys are huge and make a lot of poop in barnyard setting. They can be aggressive, can fly, and will go feral if you let them. They will chase children and demolish the garden. Not recommended for small holdings.  Pros Great meat birds because, at four months old, they can weigh several pounds. Baby chicks are sweet and adorable and make cute noises, but…  Cons . . . grown guinea fowl make a hellish screeching sound similar to that of a busted fan belt on a car, and they will sustain it for hours. Pros Stunningly beautiful, very wild, relatively low-impact when left loose in the garden because they prefer bugs to plants.  Cons They often run away, and male pheasants can be very violent (read: rape-y) towards chickens and other birds. Pros Said to be delicious, though I can’t see how such a small morsel could be worth the trouble. Their call is sweet and super cute.  Cons Impossible to tame and so tiny that they usually run away or get eaten by predators. Build quail habitat in your zone , but don’t bother trying to cage them. Pros Similar to quail but larger and more beautiful, with a wonderful call. Chukars are lovely in a garden setting and can live well with chickens.  Cons Like quail and pheasants, chukars will not put eggs on your table. Unless you plan to eat them, they are just for looks and insect control. Pros Great poop; very compatible with a small garden setting. Beautiful and interesting to listen to.  Cons They can breed like rabbits and will often move into an area where you don’t want them.  Pros Fabulous in so many ways—who doesn’t love the idea of peacocks drifting about the yard? The feathers are valuable for many uses, and they will breed readily, given enough room.  Cons Again, very difficult to tame—our peacocks went feral and live high in the conifers on the outskirts of our farm. We hear their calls in the sunset…  Pros Even more fabulous, and highly prized for their feathers, meat, and oil. Easily adapted to temperate climates and very tameable.  Cons Untamed emus can be vicious and, since they have claws like a velociraptor, they could easily kill a dog or human. Get them young and treat them right to make sure they aren’t dangerous.  This section by Marit Parker Free-range chickens in permaculture farms are a joy to behold – until they turn your seed bed into a dust bowl, hide the eggs in a thorny thicket and get eaten by a fox. However, shutting them in a permanent run means your chickens will be scratching the same bare earth every day. Meanwhile, your veg bed has pests they could be eating.  One solution is the chicken tractor – a moveable chicken coop and run. If you make one yourself you can design it to: For happy chickens in permaculture farms, you need to think about what chickens need. Their wild ancestors, the red jungle fowl, roost in trees, which is why chickens like having perches to roost on in the coop and enough space in the run to stretch their wings. Hens like having nesting boxes where they can hide away to lay eggs. For happy humans, you need to think about how the chicken tractor will be moved, and have easy access for cleaning the coop, feeding the chickens in permaculture farms and collecting the eggs. This design, made from off-cuts of wood, is quite heavy so it has wheels at one end. The mesh floor of the coop is a clever idea, but in some climates a wooden floor is needed to protect the chickens in permaculture farms from cold winds and driving rain.  Here are a couple of examples: Alternatively, it is possible to make a lightweight version using plastic pipe. However, be aware that this is not as sturdy and may leave your chickens exposed to attack by dogs or predators.  This video includes several hints and tips for clever designs for keeping chickens in permaculture farms.

"“Principle of Cyclic Opportunity: Every cyclic event increases the opportunity for yield. To increase cycling is to increase yield. Cycles in nature are diversion routes away from entropic ends-life itself cycles nutrients-giving opportunities for yield, and thus opportunities for species to occupy time niches.”
–Bill Mollison  One of the fastest and easiest way to increase the yield on your site is by harnessing cyclic opportunities that already exist there.  Natural cycles, such as planetary orbits, seasonal changes, and women’s menses, are all around us. In every step of a cycle, there are opportunities to mimic, divert, or interact within that cycle. This results in higher yields, new opportunities, and a more ecological and efficient system overall.  Most cycles are predictable, and we can learn, through observation and pattern recognition, how to divert and multiply their potential. ​As discussed in the video, adding nine cycles to the GOBRADIME/Permaculture Principles design/memory tool helps us to ensure that we cover all the bases with our design projects. The goal is to use an awareness of cycles around you to divert the flow, create new flows, and encourage a wilderness-like level of functional, thriving diversity. Most plants, from annual daisies to ancient yew trees, generally follow the same life cycle: the seed grows into a plant which flowers then produces a fruit which contains seed. Each stage provides us with an opportunity for a yield, or in other words, we can use plants at different stages. Imagined the life cycle of plants as a flow of water, with each different way of using plants creating eddies in the flow.

 What is Emotional Permaculture? Whether you call it self-care, zone , or your inner landscape, it’s all about using ecological design principles and strategies to master our mindset and thus, our behavior. Unfortunately, even the most adept ecological designers often fail to recognize the essential social elements within any community, and almost completely misses the importance of the designer’s mental health and emotional well-being. I believe that, if we can tighten our design, and spiral all the way inward to gain a mastery over our emotional landscape, then the big picture will snap into place much more clearly, and perhaps we might even have a chance at survival as a species. All cataclysmic “inevitabilities” aside, ecological design, in practice, whether agricultural, structural, social, emotional, or any combination of the above, is simply loads of fun. An ecological life, on any scale, is filled with wonder and abundance! There is truly no place I would rather be than out in the yard, moving stuff around and trying to figure out how to always make my home and garden more beautiful, more productive, less consumptive, less wasteful. I especially love the emotional stuff — sit down with some brainiac friends and have a look at any list of permaculture principles. Ask yourselves how they apply to human relationships, and you’ll have days of lively conversation about it. When you train your mind to remember permaculture theories, to pull them out like a master crafts person would pull out her favorite chisel, then you begin to see everything around you differently. These slow, steady changes in the way you experience the world shouldn’t be taken lightly, nor should they be rushed.​ One step at a time, we become adept at Caring for the Earth, Caring for the People, and Sharing the Abundance that spills forth from every corner of the emotional permaculture path. Some questions to ask yourself and think about: This is important not only to your own work, but also if you plan to interact with others on a project.

Permaculture and ideal microclimates are strictly connected. Let’s see how you can use microclimates for permaculture design. On a scale of permanence, your super-local climate is one of the hardest things to change. Yes, we are facing rapid climate change, on a global and perhaps even galactic level, but those changes took a long time to create, and they would take even longer to undo. When compared to how easy it is to change a garden bed, or your own mind, climate is much more difficult. Working with nature, rather than against it, means learning the challenges, limitations and advantages of the climate in which you live, and designing your projects accordingly. Climate is your biggest, most overarching sector, and all other sectors are layers within it. Even social relationships directly relate to the local climate! So, think it over. Because this mini-course is going out to students all over the world, we won’t get into the specifics of working in any particular climate. It will be up to you to do that research on your own. In particular, get acquainted with what climate hardiness zone* you’re in, and learn which plants do well in that zone. Start with what grows easily, then, use microclimates for permaculture design for the harder stuff. *Note: “climate hardiness zones” are not the same as the “zones of human use” as discussed here. This section by Klaudia van Gool Climate will vary more locally through human structures, topography, altitude, vegetation and water masses. This is called microclimate. By observing and analyzing our microclimate, we can use permaculture design strategies to modify it. Determining exactly what and where your on-site microclimates exist is one of the most useful applications of a thorough sector analysis. A handful of universal principles can help you find and occupy microclimates for permaculture design within your climate, in which you can grow/do/create things that weren’t otherwise possible. Creating or maximizing microclimates can help us to harness the beneficial energy within the sectors connected to our designs. In addition, microclimates can also be essential in reducing the impact of the more challenging sectors.  Let’s look at some of these factors in more detail. Microclimates are directly connected to ecological niches, where organisms occupy a space where they can thrive optimally. Creating, or being aware of having, a variety of microclimates, means you can have a wide variety of niches for more diverse planting, keeping animals, and thus increasing yields.​ We can make modifications to a microclimate to reduce and direct wind flow, as wind has a growth limiting effect on vegetation. On a windy site, planting windbreaks and shelterbelts is one of the earliest modifications needed. These create more sheltered areas and can direct the flow of air, including cold air coming downhill. Using plants to reduce wind is more effective than solid structures, which create more turbulence. In addition, we can choose species for multiple functions, which again creates more yields. We can modify our local climate or microclimate by adding water storage, which can modify temperature fluctuations. On a larger scale, we can introduce lakes or ponds to modify heat and to add light reflection. On a smaller scale, adding water storage inside a greenhouse or poly tunnel will help buffer extremes of temperature. In hot climates, planting trees and adding vegetation gives a cooling effect. This is as a result of shade and evaporation, which creates cooling.​ We can modify climate and microclimates for permaculture design through buildings, like adding a greenhouse. When we place a dwelling to the North of a greenhouse (in the Northern Hemisphere) we can make use of surplus heat and protect plants. We can paint walls white in darker, shadier areas to direct in more light and improve growth and ripening by reflecting light. Dark walls reduce frost risk by keeping warmer.  We can use thermal mass like rocks or stone walls to absorb heat and plant more tender plants close up to it. We can also use the cooler temperature of the Earth, whilst it’s warmer at the surface, to create a root cellar for food storage into the Earth, without energy based refrigeration. In cooler climates, you can create sun traps. These designs are sun-facing and wind-still, creating shelter from cold and destructive winds by capturing maximum sunlight all day. In the Victorian era in the UK, walled gardens were built on large estates to create microclimates for tender crops. Fruit trees were trained up against the walls in fan or espalier shapes.​ Hot beds are created by placing small glass frames on top of piles of manure, which generated heat as they rotted down. This is a form of season extension. What can microclimates do for you? They can help you to: Adding a hedge or windbreak can transform a garden. That’s because they create microclimates for applied permaculture design that are a huge benefit to humans, animals, and plants. While a wall seems to stop a wind completely, there are then eddies and swirls around it, whereas a hedge or windbreak allows a small amount of wind through, enough to stop swirling. However, the wind that passes through a hedge is at a slower, more gentle speed. Wind can cause a lot of damage to plants,plants and not just by breaking them or knocking them over. Wind can dehydrate plants, and salty winds can burn them, leaving the leaves damaged. Hedges also provide habitat for wildlife, increasing the biodiversity of your plot, which means you will have lots of predators on hand to eat up pests and help keep the ecosystem in balance. If you are planting a new hedge, or filling in gaps of an old hedge, think about what you want to include in it. What native trees and shrubs would benefit your garden’s wildlife? What plants would mean that, instead of losing part of your plot under the hedge, you are gaining an edible feature?

A cloche is a mini-glasshouse or polytunnel designed to cover one row or bed, or even a single plant. They give frost protection to the plants they cover, and can save plants when an unexpected late frost is forecast. Using them also means seeds can be sown and plants planted out a bit earlier. This short video by Tamsin Westhorpe introduces a few different types of cloche.  A cold frame is a small box with a hinged top covered in glass or plastic. They are often built with a used window, with a stick to prop the window open on a warm day. ​The sides can be made from bricks, wood or, for a well-insulated cold frame, straw bales. They are like a small greenhouse, just big enough to provide a protected space for small plants in pots so they don’t get too cold in the early and late parts of the season. Here are some examples: A super simple cloche or cold frame can work wonders for extending the season. But truly, if you want to create a beautiful, productive, inspiring, and multifunctional space on your site, you simply must build a greenhouse. Whether it’s a tiny makeshift hothouse you can barely stand up in, or a hundred yard high tunnel filled with mature trees, a greenhouse will increase the diversity, yield, and enjoyment of just about any site. You can plan space for propagation (seed starting) in a larger greenhouse, or build something intended especially for getting a jump start on the season. For convenience, or for simple ergonomics, this should be a bench or shelf. Extra lighting can be installed and/or heat mats are needed in more Northern climates. In temperate climates, this may not be necessary. Generally your greenhouse should be attached to your home or nearby, in your zone one area, because you will need (and want) to go there every day. Larger greenhouses used for preservation crops such as tomatoes, peppers, or fruit trees, should be placed in zone two, unless it is more of a kitchen garden, then it should stay near the house. On a larger scale, it is possible to have all three. ​Here’s a beautiful passive solar greenhouse in Alaska. And another, in Michigan.

" As a permaculture activist, you are concerned with the environment and its future. You seek to create more sustainable societies and ways of living, and focus on creating resilient communities and regenerative systems. You also aim to empower individuals and groups to become active participants in social change. That’s why, as you create your ecological design for your own home and garden, it makes sense to learn about how to be a community events organizer. This can be as simple as hosting a potluck at your house, as complicated as putting together a multi-day annual festival, or anywhere in-between. A list of great reasons could go on for ages, but the most important one is because, with the simple act of dedicating small amounts of time and space to facilitating the flow of resources in your community, you can simultaneously close the loop on all three of our permaculture ethics. A lot of magic can happen, and it all starts when one person (you!) gets the ball rolling. Look around your neighborhood for problems that need solving and/or needs that aren’t being met.  In this chapter of Food Not Lawns, How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community you’ll find a rundown of a bunch of grassroots community projects. However, since that book was written, social media happened, so now you can do all of these events online, as well! ​​The only limit is your own imagination, but it does make sense to do a little research first and get a sense of what your community really needs and wants.  In the permaculture community, a wide range of events can be found, such as seed swaps, workshops, convergences, and the ever-exciting permablitz. Defined on Wikibooks as “an informal gathering involving a day on which a group of at least two people come together to achieve the following: Permablitzes are free events, open to the public, with free workshops, shared food, where you get some exercise and have a wonderful time. To be defined as a permablitz, each event must also be preceded by a permaculture design by a qualified designer. Most permablitz networks run on reciprocity, and in order to qualify for a permablitz you usually need to volunteer at other permablitzes first, although there may be other ways of qualifying.” You can learn how to organize one at www.permablitz.net, and here’s a fun permablitz case study with Hannah Moloney: While it’s almost always a good idea to organize a permablitz, one of the biggest mistakes organizers make is to jump right to the details of the when and where with event planning before doing research and observation. Community organizing is a design process, and if you employ your designer’s toolkit, you will have a lot more success in the long run.  ​Here are eight important questions every event organizer needs to ask, before deciding the date, location, and name of an event: Regarding accessibility, and making sure somebody on the organizing team is focused on it, our own #freepermaculture course artist Kt Shepherd has some ideas, which she presents in her guidelines for Permaculture event information and marketing.

" A lot of damage is done to the planet so that humans can have food to eat at all times of the year. Think about all the packaging, refrigeration, energy consumption, landfill waste, and ocean/air pollution caused by the harvest, storage, and food preservation. As permaculture designers, our ethics demand that we incorporate these needs into our whole system design strategies. The ability to preserve food has been a lifeline for humans throughout history, allowing us to store food for long periods of time and provide sustenance throughout the year. Food preservation has come a long way since our ancestors began experimenting with salting, smoking, and air-drying meats and fish. As the years progressed, humans have developed a variety of techniques to help preserve food, from the ancient art of canning to modern-day freezing and vacuum-sealing. From making sure that food remains edible and nutritious, to helping us explore new cuisines, the history of food preservation has become an invaluable part of our lives. These traditional methods of preserving food can help to ensure that your food stays safe to eat and is full of flavor. With these methods, you can preserve food longer and minimize spoilage, saving money and keeping food fresher for longer. Assuming you’re not quite ready to build a full-on root cellar, this video focuses on storing potatoes on a small scale, AND on using recycled materials!

 Permaculture zones are patterns of human use. The zones start with yourself, your personal patterns, and what you do as a daily practice. From there, permaculture zones expand out into your home, garden, neighborhood, watershed, and extended community, until, by the time you get to zone -ish, where you have no control over anything that happens, the zone has become a sector. Sectors are patterns of uncontrolled influences, and we discuss those here. Here’s a primer on zones in permaculture. Permaculture zones don’t have hard lines between them. There is edge, crossover, and change. As an observation tool, you can use zones to look for flaws in your design, and also to evaluate what’s working well. As a design strategy, permaculture zones are a super powerful way to make choices about where to place new components in your system. And here’s another layer of information, in a video excerpted from our permaculture certificate program. Here, Crystal Stevens gives an overview of zone mapping in the home system. If your goals and ethics are the seeds of your permaculture design project, then your base map is the sprout! As a landscape designer, you should be able to draw a map that is reasonably to scale. Later in this course, you’ll analyze sectors, vision social patterns, learn to identify keypoints, and so on, and apply this information to the multiple layers of your design. ​But for today, just focus on your base map: a -dimensional, to-scale aerial view of your site’s boundaries and all of the immoveable components therein. The base map might seem like a simple thing, but it can still be quite challenging to create. Indeed, cartography on any scale can come with a steep learning curve, so be patient with yourself! If your first attempt at a base map is all funky and out of proportion, don’t worry about it! Just make another one. Check out this article and video for more information about base mapping.

As cities around the world become increasingly crowded, it is becoming increasingly urgent to find new ways of creating sustainable and innovative solutions to urban sprawl and pollution. Urban zones in permaculture are becoming a popular solution as they offer many benefits, from increasing access to nutrition to reducing waste and pollution levels. When it comes to improving our environment and sustainability, urban zones are an underrated and yet highly effective solution. An urban permaculture zone is a system that retains soil moisture and reduces water run-off, while also providing a haven for native plant species and supporting local biodiversity. Creating a high-quality urban permaculture zone begins with selecting the right location. Ideally, a permaculture zone should be close to a source of freshwater, and should be accessible to members of the local community who will be able to maintain and benefit from the area. Once the location is chosen, the next step is determining the type of plants and soil composition to use. Depending on the climate, there are a wide range of plant varieties that could be used, including fruit trees, vegetables, herbs, and flowering plants, among many others.;Free Permaculture
Integrated Pest Management means using observation and creativity, instead of chemicals. You’ve likely heard the term Integrated Pest Management, often called simply IPM, which includes a huge variety of methods and techniques, including cultural, biological and structural strategies to control a multitude of pest problems, without using any sorts of chemicals. Integrated pest management (IPM) is an approach to pest control which integrates cultural, biological and chemical methods. IPM is based on the principle that the best way to manage pests is to prevent them from occurring in the first place. The key to successful integrated pest management is to identify the problem early and treat it effectively. This means identifying the pest, understanding its biology and ecology, and developing a strategy for dealing with it. In order to do this, we need to look at the pest itself, its environment, and how it interacts with both. We also need to consider our own resources and capabilities. Once we’ve identified the pest, we need to determine whether it poses any threat to human health or property. If there is potential harm, we need to decide whether we can afford to deal with it ourselves, or whether we need professional help. Finally, once we’ve decided what action to take, we need to implement it. In most cases, this involves monitoring progress, evaluating results, and adjusting strategies accordingly. In conclusion, integrated pest management is a method of pest control that combines environmental controls, biological controls, and physical controls. Integrated Pest Management plan is a systematic plan for controlling insects, rodents, mites, weeds, fungi, nematodes, and other pests. This section by Kelda Lorax No creature fits neatly into a category of always bad (a varmint!) or always good (a cute critter.) As we watch the parade of wild species through an ecosystem, and seek to carve out space to feed ourselves, it’s helpful to think of ourselves as encouraging beneficial or much-loved wildlife closer to us, while discouraging undesirable activities. It’s of little use to blame the animal for being itself. Here are some strategies to help create homes for a healthy balance of creatures:​ Consider how you can offer habitat for the wildlife in the surrounding landscape. Water sources like bird baths or ponds are strong invites. Changing aesthetics to let old plants linger through the winter provides homes for spiders, who are very important predators that keep your garden insects in check. Places in a landscape where plants can be thick and undisturbed are often the pathways and wildlife corridors by which animals come and go.​​ These are often scary-looking bugs like wasps, assassin bugs, praying mantis, ladybugs (don’t laugh, many a gardener has hated and killed their larvae mistakenly), lacewing, etc. They’re great news because they’ll scare and eat your garden pests, which often look fat, grubby, or have lovely disguises like cabbage moths. We want the ones that look like dragons to balance it out. Yes, really! Certain adult insects won’t eat your garden pests, but their children will! These are predators, but more gnarly. If you see something like the following image (tomato horn worm pest being parasitized by wasp cocoons), you might want to say a prayer for the horn worm, but be happy for your tomatoes.​ This goes way beyond honeybees to native bees, flies, bats, beetles, hummingbirds, and more. Pollinators perform essential services in all terrestrial ecologies, and the protection of habitat that allows them to thrive is essential to life on this planet. Yes, read that sentence twice and take a moment to contemplate it. In the bibliography below, there are resources from Xerces Society, a premier conservation non-profit working on invertebrates. They outline four simple steps to protect pollinators, that subsequently protect a lot of different kinds of critters too.​ These steps are:​ This will be a mix of attracting an animal or activity to a different place, and scaring them slightly into going. It could mean making a varmint’s food prize just too annoying to access (think poly cultures, thorny plants, scarecrows). It could be the smell of humans, or the barking of dogs, that make them uncomfortable. Plan your wildlife corridor to direct animals away from precious gardens and plants, and have it full of its own fecundity. Animals do not intentionally set out to damage something you love. They might just need some direction. Here are some examples: Want to learn more about this and other topics related to permaculture, sustainability, and whole-systems design?

This section by Kelda Lorax. Just like any living creature, all animals in a Permaculture System need food, water, shelter, and space to be themselves. Whether you’re raising cows or edible grasshoppers, you should always assess how much time and materials their maintenance will require. This often means sharing responsibilities. Whether it’s a cow that’s milked by a whole neighborhood, or a big family that shares chores, always have a back-up plan for if you get sick (or if you want a vacation). For all animals in a Permaculture System, you need to consider: This section was created by Welsh sheep farmer, Marit Parker. Starting with livestock is a big decision, so remember that you don’t have to jump straight in and start breeding straight away. There are ways of having a go first:  And don’t rush! Give yourself time to learn and gain experience looking after one type of animal before starting with another type of animal. Here are some specific pointers for a few different kinds of commonly-found farm animals in a Permaculture System. One of the first decisions you have to make if you are starting with sheep is which breed of sheep to go for. And that will depend partly on the type of land you have and the climate, as some breeds of sheep are more hardy than others. Hill and mountain sheep are hardy animals that can survive out in harsh conditions all year round. Lowland sheep need better pasture and some shelter. It will also depend on your reason for keeping sheep. They produce wool, meat, milk – and more sheep!  All permaculture sheep grow wool, but some grow finer wool than others. If wool is your main reason for keeping sheep, it is worth talking to spinners and weavers and also visiting agricultural shows, especially if there are rare breeds of sheep competing.  ​All sheep can provide meat, but some grow to bigger weights than others, and the flavour of meat from different breeds varies quite a lot. Think about who the meat is for. Is it just for your family? Or are you hoping to sell it? ​ All sheep produce milk for their lambs. A select few breeds can also be milked, usually for making cheese. Manchego for example is made from sheep’s milk, and traditionally so was Wensleydale cheese. Even if wool isn’t your primary reason for keeping sheep, your sheep will need to be sheared every year for their own health and comfort. However, because nylon (i.e. plastic) is more popular for clothes, blankets and carpets, the value of run-of-the-mill fleeces is less than the cost of shearing them. So wool has become a waste product, instead of being valued for its warmth and its breathability, and the fact it doesn’t pollute the environment with microplastics. Time to close the circle and change back to wool! Take a look at Shepherdess Lesley Perrett’s youtube channel where she demonstrates practical skills needed for looking after sheep. Cows, being bigger animals, need more space than sheep. However, they fit well with sheep in and other animals in a permaculture system because cows eat long grass, whereas sheep eat short grass, so sheep can follow cows in the rotation system. These days, cattle are divided into beef breeds and dairy breeds, but most older breeds are dual purpose. If you are thinking of having a house cow, then a dual purpose breed makes sense because in order to produce milk, a cow needs to have a calf. And you want both good milk and a calf you can eventually have beef from. Cattle reared on pasture play an important role in maintaining the biodiversity of the meadow, and in ensuring the soil continues to store carbon.  Goats are browsers, not grazers, which means they prefer eating trees and shrubs to grass. They are also agile and can jump and climb, so good fencing is crucial. A herd of goats can destroy an orchard in a matter of minutes, so don’t even try to keep pet goats in a food forest environment unless you have a solid, permanent enclosure for them. They can also clear acres of brambles and/or poison oak in a matter of days. Design makes the difference.  ​Here are  other things you need to know about goats. If you’re at all considering bringing these smart, gorgeous, and hilarious animals into your system, check out this lovely article / personal case study about alpaca permaculture: Permaculture Alpacas by Claire Gregory. Many permaculture sites keep rabbits for manure, meat, and weed control. They’re easy, quiet, and don’t take up a ton of space, though it’s hard to keep them free-range because they are quickly stolen by raptors, so you end up having to keep them in cages, which might not be preferable for some designers. Here’s an article about rabbit manure. Check out Rabbit Ridge Farm Pets are part of our lives and part of our families, so mustn’t be forgotten when we are thinking about animals in a permaculture system, and about designing our whole system to be sustainable.

" Before i delve into Permaculture Food Forest, I’d like to share this essay, which completely changed my life, in , and set me on the path I’m still on today, Joe Hollis writes: “Our world is being destroyed, in the final analysis, by an extremely misguided notion of what constitutes a successful human life. Materialism is running rampant and WILL CONSUME EVERYTHING, because its hunger will never be sated by its consumption. Human life has become a cancer on the planet, gobbling up all the flows of matter and energy, poisoning with our waste. What can stop this monster? Nothing. Just this: walk away from it. It is time, indeed time is running out, to abandon the entire edifice of civilization / the State / the Economy and walk (don’t run!) to a better place: home, to Paradise.” Easy! We grow it, everywhere we go. At this point, we don’t need to dwell on why growing permaculture food forests and paradise gardens is so important. If you’ve made it to this place, you know why. And it’s not a hobby or even a choice anymore. At this point, devoting massive portions of your spare time to gardening is an imperative. So, let’s get to how to create a diverse, thriving garden that will last for a thousand generations and provide sustainable yields over multiple layers of time, space, and function.  Permaculture is known for long-lasting, low-maintenance perennial gardens that stack plants in time, space, and function. The polar opposite of a monoculture, a well-planned polyculture will yield year-round, providing food, seeds, and compost crops for people, wildlife, and microorganisms alike. Because they are so diverse, polycultures yield more and are less susceptible to disease and insect infestation.  The result of this type of agriculture is a lush, abundant oasis, teeming with fresh fruit and birdsong, and when I heard Joe Hollis call this type of agriculture “paradise gardening,” it made sense to me and I started calling it that, too. Everything you need to know about gardening, or quite possibly everything you need to know about life. You can learn from the plants. Every time you interact with a plant, whether it’s a microscopic one or a giant ancient tree, you learn something about the planet, you learn something about yourself, and you learn something about how to bridge the gap between what we currently call humanity and the potential for a sustainable future as a coexisting symbiotic species here on the planet in the global biosphere. As gardeners with our hands in the soil, we have the opportunity to create a legacy that we can see immediate results from our own lives, and we can see reverberations as we move through the garden over the seasons and over the years. Gardening gives us immediate feedback. The plants are able to exhibit evolutionary traits very quickly, because their life cycles turn over so much more quickly than ours. So, we can learn from them about how changes in the biosphere, changes in microclimate, and even tiny changes in the way the wind blows can have profound effects on the success or failure of an organism and the community that organism is connected to. We can use the natural forest as a model for building guilds that layer functional niches within niches in space and time. When we plant several of these guilds together the result is a multifunctional, polycultural garden that thrives in low-maintenance perpetuity.  To understand this, think of the way a forest looks: small plants and debris cover the ground so that no soil is bare. Larger plants and shrubs grow up against small trees, and tall trees fill in the gaps to create an overstory canopy that is rich in bird and animal life. Vines wrap around the trees and drip across the skyline. Something is always sprouting while neighboring plants die or go dormant for the season, and some kind of food is always available. ​The entire permaculture food forest remains moist and cool even on hot days, yet cold winds and killing frost rarely penetrate the dense growth, so the interior of the forest remains temperate, while sun loving plants crowd the edges where there is more light. Every nook and niche has something to offer and is home to something or someone, so that every square foot reeks of life and diversity.  We can view the layers of a polyculture in three parts: function, space, and time. Here’s a rundown of niches the plants in your garden could occupy, to create layers of function, space, and time:  Sure, summer is the peak season for most gardeners, but in many climates you can have food and flowers year-round, and you can also design plantings to succeed each other, over the many years to come. Use niches in time, combined with niches in space and function, to deepen and diversify the productivity of your garden.  Want some examples? Here’s an article with a few specific examples of successful garden guilds that work in a lot of different climates.  ​Always be sure to give each plant plenty of room to grow. Clotted areas provide the moist, sticky conditions many harmful pests need to thrive, and when plants are too crowded they compete for nutrients, which weakens them and makes them vulnerable to insects and disease. So water, weed, mulch, and prune when necessary. The most common mistake gardeners make is planting things too close together— remember how big the plants will be at maturity, and make sure they have the space they need.  Most plants, from annual daisies to ancient yew trees, generally follow the same life cycle: the seed grows into a plant which flowers then produces a fruit which contains seed.Each stage provides us with an opportunity for a yield, or in other words, we can use plants at different stages. Imagined the life cycle of plants as a flow of water, with each different way of using plants creating eddies in the flow.

They use techniques such as companion planting, crop rotation, intercropping, and polyculture (growing multiple crops from different species) to create sustainable food production systems. Permaculture gardening uses these principles to design landscapes that provide for all life on Earth, including humans. It also provides an alternative to the current industrial agricultural system which relies heavily on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The goal of permaculture is not just to grow food but to build healthy communities and regenerative environments. A permaculture orchard can be thought of as a mini ecosystem. You are creating a microcosm of nature within your property. This includes planting trees that will provide food, shelter, and habitat for wildlife. In addition to this, a permaculture orchard also provides many benefits for humans, the most obvious being the fact that you’ll have delicious fruits and vegetables throughout the year. But there are also some less obvious benefits, such as the fact that you’ll be able to reduce your carbon footprint and help save our planet. Permaculture perennials don’t require constant maintenance like an annual garden does. Instead, perennials continuously add organic material to the soil over time—leaves, stems, roots, seeds, and flowers. This helps to build up the fertility of the soil, making it easier for future crops to grow. In addition, because perennials are native to the area, they’re already adapted to local conditions. They’ll naturally attract beneficial insects and birds, and provide shelter for wildlife. And, since they live for many years, they can even contribute to the restoration of damaged habitats. Finally, there’s no need to buy expensive fertilizer or pesticides. All you need is some compost to keep the system efficiently producing fine edible permaculture produce. Evergreen trees are not only useful for their aesthetic value but they also provide many other benefits such as food production, erosion control, wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, water filtration, soil stabilization, wind protection, shade and firewood. They can also help reduce urban heat island effects by shading buildings and roadsides. The best way to grow these trees is to plant them in groups on steep slopes where they have access to moisture from rainwater runoff. In addition, they need lots of space to spread roots and branches. This allows them to reach deep into the ground and soak up nutrients. A well-designed garden should include at least three different types of tree species, including conifers, broadleafs and deciduous trees. The following are examples of trees that do not belong in a permaculture design.;Free Permaculture
"Through Appropriate Technology for Permaculture Design, we are engineering ways in which to meet those needs in the simplest, most locally based ways possible. The ecological crises that we are facing today is very much related to the fact that our economy, our agriculture, and our technologies are out of scale with what the planet can support. When entities are out of scale, natural patterns in the landscape are disrupted. In fact, it is our advances in technology that have led to a lot of that destruction. For example, combine harvesters have allowed us to cultivate large monocultures that have led to soil erosion and topsoil depletion. Advances in cell phones and computers, coupled with consumerism and a global economy, have not only mined the earth of natural resources, but have created tons of electronic waste that fill our landfills. ​Understanding and using appropriate permaculture technology is about bringing things back into scale and applying the permaculture principle of using small and slow solutions. As mentioned in the video, Appropriate Technology for Permaculture Design is suited to the social and economic conditions of a particular region in which it is to be applied, is ecologically sound, and promotes self-reliance on the part of those using it. It is: Before you think of applying any new appropriate technology, think first about reducing your consumption. Though it’s heartening to see advances in alternative energy, such as solar and wind, it seems like many of these advances are designed to meet society’s current needs, without addressing our overconsumption. For example, people choose to put solar panels on their roofs to power their TVs, dryers, multiple appliances, and possibly even multiple cars. While it may be a step in the right direction, alternative energy technology often prevents us from taking a good look at our consumption. What’s more, these technologies contain a lot of embodied energy. From the extraction of the base materials to the manufacturing and the shipping, the energy involved in producing a product like a solar panel or a wind turbine is substantial. Chances are that if you live in a developed nation, you are likely consuming at a level that is not sustainable for the rest of the planet. The challenge is not to find an energy source that will support that lifestyle, the solution first lies in our willingness to reduce our consumption. Then, we can look at appropriate technologies to meet our reduced needs. The most obvious way to reduce consumption is through growing your own food. Reducing our transportation miles from farm to table immediately reduces our impact. ​Simple strategies in your home can go a long way. For example, though we have a permaculture homestead, we do live in a conventional home. However, before putting solar panels on our roof, which is perfectly expected for that technology and in a climate where it makes sense, I am going to look at ways to reduce our energy use first.  This is what we have done so far for Appropriate Technology: In the coming years, our plan is to attach a greenhouse to the front of the house. This will not only provide passive solar heating, which is key in our cold climate, but serves the additional function of growing more food and extending our short growing season. Only after we’ve added a greenhouse, will I then consider solar panels. However, I’ll evaluate our energy bills at that point, balancing the expense of the panels and their embodied energy versus the energy produced. ​Again, using small and slow solutions that take minimal resources is your primary goal. Below is a checklist for easily reducing your household consumption in a conventional home. Want to learn more about this and other topics related to permaculture, sustainability, and whole-systems design?
We offer a range of FREE (donations optional) online courses!  Appropriate Technology means that you are designing to scale, to your site, and to the local resources that are available. Always fall back on the idea of good design first. You should start by asking these two main questions: Then, follow-up the design process with these questions: With these questions in mind, remember that a technology that is appropriate to one set of circumstances is not necessarily appropriate for another. For example, using a solar oven in Seattle, Washington where there are few days of sun, would not be a good idea. However, that same solar oven in Denver, Colorado where they receive  days of sunshine/year, is a perfect solution.  As a complement to these strategies, you can easily reduce your carbon footprint by setting up a lifestyle that is more of a walking/biking culture vs. a driving culture. This approach brings us back to the idea of zones in permaculture. Rather than thinking of zones in the context of a property, you want to use the zoning idea with regard to where you live and how often you are walking, biking, driving and flying. For example, if zone  is your house, then zone  is where you walk to on a daily basis, zone  are locations that are “bikeable”, zone  are locations that you frequent via public transport, zone  are places where you need to travel by car, and finally, zone  are those regions where you would need to fly, take a train or a boat. You could conceivably design your life where your house is located near your place of work (if not in your home), your children’s school is within walking distance, perhaps the grocery store and library are within biking distance, and your babysitter is within driving distance. Finally, the visit to your family once a year during the holidays requires a flight. The idea is to design your life in such a way that, like on a property, you are spending most of your time in zones  and , the areas that you need to visit on a daily basis.

"What is Plant Propagation? Plant propagation is the process of multiplying plants by creating new plants out of existing ones. This can be done by taking cuttings from mature plants, dividing rootstocks, layering, grafting, budding, tissue culture, micropropagation, seed germination, etc. There are many different methods to propagate plants depending on what type of plant you want to grow. For example, some plants require a large amount of space while others don’t take up much room. Some plants are easier to propagate than others. Propagating plants is a great way to save money because you won’t have to buy expensive plants every year. You’ll also be able to grow plants that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. Plant propagation falls into two categories: sexual and asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction is about seeds, pollen/flowers, swapping of genetic material and inviting in slight variations and newness. Some plants are wildly “untrue to seed” because parent material was a crafted hybrid. Some plants are very tidily true to seed, in form and taste very much like their parents. Those are the ones that are easier to save seed from. In general, plants from seeds, and plants which create seeds, are more ecologically resilient because they’re quicker to adapt. Pros: quickly adapts to your site, easy to store & share, culturally important to be part of the genetic diversity maintenance & process.  Cons: can cross into duds, observation needed when flowering (so no interference), new plants will need more time. Asexual reproduction might not sound as exciting as flower sex, but hey, it really helps grow a lot of exact plants fast. If you have a whole food forest understory to populate, than having pots of mint, yarrow, strawberries, oregano, thyme, bee balm, chives, etc., all propagated through asexual means is what can do the job fast (and fragrantly and deliciously!)  These techniques are all variations on cutting a plant apart to start new ones. You can divide, literally with a serrated kitchen knife, replant runners (like strawberries), or encourage other plants to have stems make roots (through “layering”). You can cut parts of the plant to make “cuttings” or “clones” that root on their own, or with some plants “live stake” cuttings straight into the ground. Many plants take better to one technique than another, and if you’re unsure, ask Google “what’s the easiest way to propagate ____?”.​ Pros: faster, exact flavor and type, bigger plants. Cons: Sterile pots/potting soil infrastructure needed, not as resilient ecologically and, over the long term, can become sterile, making sexual reproduction impossible and severely limiting the genetic potential of the plant. Grafting, which combines sexual and asexual reproduction (you grow root stock from seed, then graft clone stock onto it) is a method of combining two plants in order to get the plant we want. This is usually done with fruit trees because growing fruit trees from seed won’t result in the same variety. A twig or scion from the parent fruit tree is grafted onto a rootstock. The rootstock needs to come from a tree in the same family. There is often a choice of rootstocks; different ones result in larger or smaller trees. The scion and rootstock are carefully cut so that the cambium (green growing layer) of both fits together. A graft is successful when the scion and rootstock have fused and become one plant.  Pros: great fruit, great structure, can plan for diversity of sizes (from dwarf to standard). Cons: weaker plants, may not live as long, more expensive. We touched on grafting in this article, in case you missed it. Propagating plants is one of the key elements of sustainable agriculture. You can grow many different crops from just a few seeds, and it allows you to produce large amounts of food without having to buy thousands of dollars worth of fertilizer each season. In addition, propagating plants is much cheaper than buying plants from nurseries. In permaculture, there are several ways to propagate plants. Some of the methods include layering, dividing, rooting, grafting, budding, budding off, and cutting. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on what type of crop you wish to grow.

START ANYTIME, GO AT YOUR OWN PACE This one-of-a-kind online course is perfect for writers, designers, community organizers, and other creatives who want to cooperate rather than compete and manifest a right livelihood that thrives. A lot of the time, “help the planet,” “be creative,” and “make ends meet” can feel like totally separate goals. We work to pay the bills, then play in the garden to help the Earth. If we have time, we make art, do the writing, play the music. Or, all too often, we dedicate our lives to art, writing, and/or regenerative work, but we are constantly struggling for funds and careening toward burnout and despair. When you figure out how to leverage your unique position, knowledge, and connections, you won’t have to chase after funds, support, and resources. They will come to you. Synergy leads to abundance. That’s how ecology works and we’re no different! In this free (donations accepted) -day online course, we will look at why you need to find your niche, how it can bring abundance to you and yours, and which permaculture tools you can use to design an actionable strategy to help you turn your best ideas into tangible, edible reality. Nature understands that everyone needs a niche, and indeed everybody has one, but sometimes it’s hard to figure out what YOURS is. There are so many wonderful ways to make a living while also helping others and regenerating the Earth, but sometimes we just need a little help thinking outside the box. This course will provide you with a quick and easy toolkit to help you access opportunities you might not even know you have. Writers, artists, and musicians Teachers, speakers, consultants Ecopreneurs You! Especially if you’re interested in taking a permaculture-style, ecological systems-thinking approach to solving problems for yourself and your community, this course will help you envision a tangible plan of action. Like the mighty goldfinch who has her babies late in the year so they can have a vegan diet, so too can you figure out the changes you need to make so that you and your family can really thrive. No. In fact, you’ll get a basic introduction to what permaculture is and does, on Day One. Here’s a quick overview of what you’ll learn–three days, three classes, and a toolkit that will change your life: Day One Use observation and inquiry to find out what’s already there and how best you can improve, rather than disrupt the existing ecosystem. Day Two Use microclimates to find and discover specific opportunities you may have missed. Day Three Use a clear, deliberate whole-system design process to develop an actionable strategy moving forward.

"A permaculture designer should know the difference between “resources” and “waste.” Imagine you have a site with lots of fun components, you’re making use of plants, edges, microclimates, and design strategies, and you have a system. But…there are piles of junk everywhere. Some of it is on its way in, some might be on its way out. Some of it is earmarked for future projects, other stuff might be just sitting around waiting for somebody to have a great idea for how to use it.  That’s all fine and good, but if those piles are disorganized, out in the weather for months (or years) on end, or otherwise not actively being pulled into use in a system you have intentionally, and thoroughly designed, then sorry: that ain’t permaculture.  Permaculture is not hoarding, and it isn’t “prepping,” either. There are lots of “preppers” in the permaculture community, but know that they are not synonymous in any way.​ There are merits to creating strategic, carefully stored caches to help ensure future survival; but if those resources are deteriorating in storage, and/or if there are other people/plants/permaculture systems nearby who could benefit from those resources, then you aren’t “collecting resources”–you’re hoarding. Hoarding causes ecological, social, emotional, and functional damage to the system, but if you maintain a clean, organized site, with a reasonable, realistic stash of materials and an open, functional flow of resources, your whole system will thrive. Reason #: Ethics. ​Unused surplus is waste. Seeds, plants, food, tools, vehicles, musical instruments, and many/most building materials will deteriorate in storage, often to the point of uselessness. But if they are shared as a surplus, then they invigorate the system and generate abundance.  Remember we are working with three ethics: care for people and planet, PLUS being mindful about closing the loop, paying it forward, and sharing what we create. If you look around the piles and storage spots and eddies in your flow of onsite resources, and think about tidying up as an act of service to your communities, human and otherwise, it becomes a joyful, deliberate part of the design process instead of just another list of clean-up chores. For an example of an ecologically designed permaculture community that makes use of surplus resources and is kept absolutely clean, check out Village Homes in Davis, California. Even with so many different types of families living in such close proximity, they manage to keep everything flowing and organized. Gorgeous! Reason #: Relationships. This is a big one. Especially if you live in an urban or suburban neighborhood, chances are folks can see into your site, and they do not want to look at a bunch of blue tarps and broken tools! You might even end up with a citation from your city or HOA, if you take it too far. And, while it can be really annoying when cities don’t allow people to grow food out front, it makes sense that folks wouldn’t want to live next door to a junkyard.  Building happy relationships with neighbors is about more than just not being antagonistic, though. It’s also about building a thriving system, together, and if you want to introduce your neighbors to permaculture as a way of life, you’ll convince them much more quickly if they are totally amazed when they walk into your site, rather than being startled by spiders and afraid they’ll get Tetanus from your outhouse! You might even be able to get your neighbors to help you clean the place up! Here’s an article about neighbors using Permablitzes to help each other grow food. And here’s a quick list, from my own blog, of rules for growing food out front. Reason #: Access. Paths, roads, storage, greenhouses, garden beds…everything is easier to get to when there isn’t a bunch of unused crap in the way. Want to learn more about this and other topics related to permaculture, sustainability, and whole-systems design? We offer a range of FREE (donations optional) online courses! Reason #: Health, for people, plants, and animals. Stagnated piles of junk and organic matter create habitat for all sorts of molds, fungi, bacteria, insects, rodents, and pathogenic creatures and critters. Clean spaces give you the ability to control problems and make it easier to identify where a particular problem might be coming from. This could probably extend to the gardener’s mental health and cognitive abilities as well–too much clutter can feel chaotic and unsettling, and can lead to unclear and misinformed design decisions. Additionally, if dangerous and/or toxic materials are left scattered about, children and animals could face real dangers. (“Junkyard Playgrounds” are a thing, btw! But they seem kinda sketchy to me) Reason #: Beauty and Inspiration A clean, open space invites ideas. When it comes to permaculture landscape design, there really is no such thing as a “blank slate,” but clearing all the random chaos out of the way can really help you to recognize flows and patterns, identify edges and microclimates, and determine where you might to place components, in relationships with each other. This is so much better of an approach than having to design around a bunch of stagnant components that truly, need to go. Also, depending on what type of character you are, maintaining spaces, even within your completed projects, that are meant to be open and empty, can help with your peace of mind and sense of tranquility. They don’t call it a “Zen garden” for nothing!  Beauty is a yield. Beauty has a purpose. Beautiful spaces help make people happy. Why work so hard to create a functional whole-system design, and then not take it all the way to FAB?!? Why a green movement must be beautiful Here’s an example: In my opinion, this “storage zone” that walks the line between “useful resource cache” and “junk zone needs to be cleaned up.” He seems to have clear intent for most of these materials, and some of them are stored in a way that helps to preserve them, so that’s all good. But I wonder if he has friends and neighbors who could put some of that junk to use more quickly, and then that creates space in his resource collection zone to save even MORE stuff from the local landfill! You can see from the background in the video that this is a large site full of plants and natural beauty, and one can’t help but wonder what percentage of his land is consumed by the junkyard zone. Check it out: You can still save stuff from the landfill, without piling it all up in your own yard! Some ways to transform and/or redistribute stuff: Pretty much, yep. Keeping a healthy flow of resources and resisting stagnation on your permaculture site goes way beyond KonMari, though you have to admit: choosing components based on whether or not they spark joy is pretty wonderful.  Check out this graphic with her method outlined, in case you aren’t familiar with it. So how does KonMari become permaculture? Try going through your permaculture site, zone by zone.. Whip it ALL into shape, and you will be amazed at how much more clear and possible moving forward with your whole system permaculture design project becomes.";Free Permaculture
"Shrubs require less maintenance than annual vegetables, and some can produce hundreds of pounds of food each year, with almost no labor once they get established. Most will benefit from regular mulching and pruning. Many of the fiber plants fall into this category, as do most small fruits and berries. If you are planting shrubs in amongst trees to create a food forest, plant the shrubs while the trees are still young, because many of them need sun to get established. Once established, most shrubs will be relatively drought and shade tolerant and will help filter the wind through the low parts of the garden. This is important because though trees provide an excellent windbreak, if there are no shrubs, then the open space creates a cold wind tunnel, which can be rough on tender herbs and vegetables. Shrubs are usually thought of as ornamental: gardeners often don’t realize how many shrubs are edible!  Here’s a list of edible and useful shrubs that will grow well in many different climates.  Regional definitions of the term “hedgerow” vary widely, so we’ll define a hedgerow, for our permaculture purposes, as a perennial polyculture planted along an edge.A well-designed, multifunctional hedgerow can provide food, shade, privacy, habitat, firewood, and much, much more. Hedgerows can create microclimates, redirect strong winds, condition soil, and shelter large areas of tender plants that might not otherwise thrive in your area. So a hedgerow is not AT ALL just a bunch of bushes–plants in every layer can make up a hedgerow,and a hedgerow can solve a lot of design problems.  One of the major benefits of having a hedgerow is that it creates habitat for beneficial insects. Check out this video, from the AWESOME Peaceful Valley channel. Her style of garden beds isn’t perhaps what everyone would choose, but she gives some sound advice about seed and plant mixes that will attract and protect beneficial insects.   By Jude Hobbs as published in Food Not Lawns, How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community, available for free, here.​ Multifunctional hedgerows are an excellent strategy to include in an ecological garden as part of whole- system design for self-reliant living. Hedgerows consist of mixed plantings that may include trees, shrubs, low-growing plants, perennials, herbs, and vines. Hedgerows often grow along field borders, fence lines, and riparian zones in either rural or suburban settings. They enhance the beauty, productivity, and biodiversity of the landscape.  Hedgerows act as bank and soil stabilizers and conditioners; animal fodder; nectar sources for bees and other pollinators; habitat for pest predators, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians; windbreaks, shelterbelts, and privacy and sound barriers; and a source of diversified income. In riparian zones hedgerows also provide shade areas that cool the water temperature. They are an ultimate opportunity for biodiversity.  Potential income producing opportunities of hedgerows include fuel wood, craft materials (such as willow), medicinal herbs, floral materials and dye plants, and seeds, rootstock, and cuttings for propagation. The leaves, berries, nuts, roots, shoots, and fungi are wonderful food sources.  One of the most useful functions of hedgerow plantings is their role as windbreaks. Wind will be affected by a planting that is only three feet high as long as it is of  percent density and is sited perpendicular to the wind. It can also reduce home heating costs from  to  percent. Hedgerow windbreaks can typically reduce open-field wind speeds by  to  percent at distances of up to ten times their height.  The combination of function and beauty is an essential component of all landscaping. The location and size of the area to be planted will determine hedgerow design, but hedgerows are always longer than they are wide. In placement, a north–south planting direction is ideal but not essential. Whenever possible, arrange hedgerows perpendicular to prevailing winds.​ Although a single line of trees will provide some benefits, four or more rows of plants are best for windbreaks, water and soil conservation, wildlife habitat, and general biodiversity. When it works for the situation, place plants tallest at maturity in the center row, with shorter ones interplanted between and along the edges. ​ A diverse selection of plant sizes and characteristics is most beneficial. Through thoughtful observation, the design will match the site and plant characteristics. The elements that influence plant selection, again, are function, location, and size of a fully grown hedgerow. Planting hedgerows also encourages wildlife corridors. As an example, if you are interested in attracting birds, then include deciduous trees as the tallest plant in the hedgerow. Birds find it much easier to land in deciduous trees due to their open form.  Establishing a hedgerow is a long-term commitment. With proper planning and care, it will take approximately four to eight years to establish the planting and thirty or more years for it to reach maturity. However, it is worth the investment. Whether in a rural or urban setting, multispecies plantings provide beneficial opportunities for everyone. By Marit Parker In permaculture we usually find tall, multi-species, multilayered hedgerows, designed to do all of the things. But it’s a common misconception that a more traditional-looking hedge isn’t multifunctional as well. They are.  Hedges became a common feature of the British landscape as a result of the Enclosure Acts, between  and , when what had been common or shared land became fields. Many of the hedges we still see date back even further.  A new project in Wales calls hedges the “Long Forest” Hedges around the edges of fields are important for wildlife, providing not just local habitat but also creating highways between rivers and forests.  What is hedgelaying? Hedgelaying is a valuable and satisfying skill that involves cutting partway through the stems of young trees and carefully bending them over and weaving them into each other to recreate and strengthen the hedge as a stock-proof barrier. Techniques vary in different regions because hedges also vary, with different dominant species (eg hazel or hawthorn).  Here, National Trust Ranger Claire Pyne describes why hedgelaying is important. If you’d like to learn how to hedgelay, conservation groups in the UK, such as The Conservation Volunteers, usually have at least some hedgelaying sessions in the winter months. images by Marit Parker, from Cowbridge Physic Garden Want to learn more about this and other topics related to permaculture, sustainability, and whole-systems design?

 Sometimes, no matter how hard we might try to avoid it, problems come up between individuals working together on a project. And, whether we like it or not, the main reason so many permaculture projects don’t make it to the long-term is rarely because the soil was no good or all the water dried up: it’s because the interpersonal human relationships fell apart.

Just kidding! Growing food takes time, patience, and a willingness to learn how to adapt what you learn to suit your climate and microclimates. In this regard, there is NO BETTER source of information than your local elders when it comes to how to grow food in your local area. Find them, help them, and learn from them. Meanwhile, here are some resources to get you started!  Growing food is one of the funnest parts of permaculture! Some folks call this a potager garden, and it’s all about putting food on the table. But this can be easier said than done, and it makes a lot of sense to apply the same careful and deliberate design process to your veg patch as you do to the whole system. The first thing you need to remember is that ALL of the stuff we have learned in this course so far can be applied to designing your vegetable garden. Gardening is only a small part of permaculture, but the food garden will inevitably be the nexus of your project, and all of the theories and tools we’ve been studying (zones, sectors, cyclic opportunity, scale of permanence, etc) apply. In fact, the permaculture kitchen garden is a great place to start testing and practicing those theories, so that you can better understand and conceptualize them for your whole-system design. Many of us grow the bulk of our vegetables within an integrated, multi-layer food forest that also contains trees, shrubs, vines, soil-building projects, and animals. Some folks, depending on their circumstances, prefer to have an area designated for full-sun, annual and biennial vegetables. Either way, plants need a garden bed to grow in, and there are many styles to choose from.  You’ll need to decide that for yourself, based on your site and situation! This chart will help you figure out which types of garden beds to use in your space. It would be a disservice to you, students, for us to pretend like we’re the end-all be-all of vegetable growing expertise. There are so many amazing people out there, sharing super-valuable information on this topic. As such, we’ll focus on a handful of videos from a variety of situations, but don’t stop there!

"“How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.” 
–Anne Frank  This section by Sarah Wu These words are used quite loosely and often interchangeably, but what is the difference and how can you present the experience you are offering or looking to participate in in the correct way? Here are the definitions and how you can create a program that will suit your needs and the needs of the participant. What about WWOOFing? Perhaps you have been a WWOOFer or maybe you get requests to accept WWOOFers. WWOOF stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, or Willing Workers on Organic Farms and is a global network of workers and farms/projects who are seeking an energy exchange that does not allow for any financial exchange. There are other organizations to work through as well, such as Organic Volunteers, Workaway, and HelpX, but mostly people just call it all “woofing.” “WWOOFers” are asked to work a certain number of hours daily, and time commitments vary from a few days to a few weeks. Members, both those volunteering and those hosting, pay annual dues for use of the network and website for each country the volunteer is interested in working in, with prices ranging from $-$ USD.  This has benefits depending on what you are willing to do as a volunteer and what you are willing to offer as a host. If you are entering your harvest season and need extra hands, WWOOFers can be great, get them doing busy work. If the project needs a bit more skill and attention, there is no commitment other than the word of the volunteer that they will be present to help. They can flake on you and from experience, I can say they do.  ​This is the reason why many farms have switched to asking for volunteer tuitions because they are guaranteed a monetary exchange for their time/energy in hosting a volunteer. Due to the current capitalist paradigm we live in, paying for something adds a kind of value that typically warrants commitment. I have found that in Central America, people rarely accept WWOOFers, it seems to be something European projects gravitate toward. Her’s a facebook group kinda like WWOOF, but just for women.

 In addition to food and shelter, all humans have four basic needs: to learn new things, to be a part of something bigger than ourselves, to leave a mark on the world, and to care and be cared for. All archetypal studies, from psychology to storytelling to marketing, returns to this assertion, and we see it all around us, especially in our buildings.  Think about it. What do we built besides houses? Schools, churches, hospitals, theaters. Roads to the wilderness. Fences between good neighbors. It all connects to those four fundamental human needs: inquiry, community, legacy, and connection. In a permaculture design, the built environment becomes the nexus between our own needs and the needs of the other species we have, by our ethics, chosen to protect. As such, it is important that the buildings we create are designed accordingly. Doing this requires a shift in how we look at the built environment as a whole, but this isn’t difficult to accomplish, and the easiest way is by starting with where you live, today, and tuning into the edges, microclimates, and intersections where the human-built space connects to the biological spaces. Where does mechanism meet organism? Find your design opportunities there. As humans, our built environment is in our hands, over our heads, and under our butts all day, every day, and it makes tons of sense that we would start our whole-systems design projects from the built environment as a starting point. But it also makes sense to learn the other stuff first, to open doors in your designer’s mind, and get you geeked out on plants and seeds and systems for a while…because now you can look at the structures and squares and hard surfaces around you and more easily see what I mean when I say: Study this image of a suburban permaculture demonstration site. What’s missing? How could the structures in their built environment be more connected to each other, and to the landscape?  And, sometimes opportunities are created through the building of an environment! Check out this amazing project: Most of the time, it’s a MUCH more ecological choice to retrofit your existing building than to build something new.

For the most part, this website focuses on providing resources for folks who probably don’t have the resources to own (or even rent) more than an acre (or less) of land. We see this as an important niche to fill, because so many people live in urban environments and/or on a very low income, and all too often they jump to the conclusion that permaculture isn’t for them, since they don’t own a farm. Hopefully by now, the myth that you have to be a landowner to do permaculture has been dispelled! Still, some of you DO have access to big land, and there are for sure certain important factors to consider when designing on a larger scale. Even if you don’t have a farm, this article will help you recognize the important of scale and give you a bunch of inspiring examples of what can be done on large sites.  The answer to a lot of questions in permaculture is “it depends,” and this is often because of scale. We can all probably agree that  acres and bigger could be considered big, and that an apartment balcony or a tiny urban patio is small, but of course it’s much more complex than that. It’s not just about the size of the land, but about the scale and intensity of the projects being undertaken, the amount of people involved, the boundaries framing the design, and much more. So, for clarity’s sake, and based on the demographics of the our student community, we are calling anything above an acre “farm scale.” ​Zooming into the outer zones: the size and relative location of your zones will look quite different on large vs. small sites. As you know, “zones” are patterns of human use, and are organized by how productive they are, how much maintenance they need, and the resources such as water, materials or energy that they require. As you remember, zone : your home and yourself, zone : the domestic zone, and zone : the orchard zone. Let’s look more closely at zones -.​ The outer zones are not all about owning lots of land. Zones are simply a tool to help you work out the best place for things in your design. They reflect how frequently you need to work in a particular part of your site, or how often you visit it, so even on a small plot you may have, or be able to create, outer zones. For example you may have a couple of logs inoculated with mushroom spores (zone ) in amongst a food forest on what used to be your front lawn (zone ). Alternatively, you can use the wider community, including parks, wild spaces, incubator farms, or your neighbors’ gardens for these zones. Zones can also be used to reduce carrying heavy things further than you need to. For example, the fruit trees in the orchard zone don’t need tending every day, but when the fruit is ripe, having it near the house is a huge advantage and means the crop is more likely to be enjoyed to its full. Zone  is typically called “the farm zone,” but this could also be (varies widely according to context): Generally called “the forage zone,” Zone  tends to be seasonal in use. This could include: These are the wild areas, where you may still go but generally don’t try to change or control. This could include: Whether you own land yourself, are renting it or are managing it as part of a community group, there are significant differences to managing land on a big scale. It’s worth taking the time to think through the challenges and design a system that works for you and/or for the group. The good news is that there are a wealth of traditional and Indigenous practices we can learn from, adapting ideas to suit current circumstances. New terms appear regularly for “new” sustainable approaches to farming but they are usually a re-packaging of traditional and Indigenous ideas and practices.   If you’ve recently purchased land as a “blank slate,” in a community you aren’t from, please take a moment to read this article, about Why My Farm Isn’t a Permaculture Farm. ​In general, managing more land does take more time. But you can stack functions and harness flows in ways that radically reduce the inputs. For example, if you have to walk across the farm every time you need tools for the garden in your front yard, it makes more sense to have a second tool shed, close to home, than it does to spend the time walking back and forth. On a small site, this extra effort would be a negligible amount of minutes per year. But on large acreage, it could add up to several hours a year. ​So the larger you get, the more you have to account for things like travel time and relative location. Figure out the scope of your project. Observing your site, determining your goals, understanding your boundaries and evaluating your resources will help you to understand what the scope of your project is. You’ll get much more familiar with these steps as you start to engage with the Design Studio. To avoid making unnecessary investments and poor decisions, it is important to decide whether you want to make your permaculture project into a livelihood project or a hobby project. You may also wish to think about whether it will be just yourself and your family on the site, or if you will be inviting others to live, work, and contribute. This is an important distinction to make and will determine how you go about designing and investing in your site. Consider some ideas around “going big”: Ask not what the land can do for you, but what you can do for the land. If you have access to a large parcel of land, think about the ecological benefits of establishing big, thriving zones  and . You may consider establishing permanent wildlife corridors, rehabilitating degraded riparian zones, replanting native at risk species (with help from trained naturalists), or simply allowing nature to take its course and cultivate biodiversity and healthy soils through succession. The benefits of these decisions will be felt for miles around in the wider ecosystem. It’s a chance to collaborate and build community. Think of the social, cultural, spiritual, experiential, and intellectual wealth that can be grown on a large parcel of land. This may happen through working with local artisans, non profit groups, Indigenous communities, schools, seniors centres, youth programs etc. The land could become a model of large-scale sustainable land management. If you own the land, then recognize that you are one of a very privileged few. It would be beneficial to think about what kind of responsibility you are willing to take on with regard to the “fair share” ethic. You could design a livelihood in collaboration with the land. If planned and executed with care and forethought, it’s possible that you could make a sustainable livelihood through agriculture, probably coupled with other sources of income, such as running workshops and other offsite projects.  At any scale, agriculture is hard work and requires planning, energy, perseverance, and drive. Your yields might come in the form of experience, exercise (a euphemism for sore muscles), community growth, or spiritual satisfaction before they come in monetary form. It’s important to ask yourself why you wish to pursue this path. Consider some ideas around “staying small” Biting off more than we can chew is a common occurrence with new, over-enthusiastic permaculturists. Especially when we get access to a large property, it can be tempting to work off of vague ideas or beautiful photos in magazines, then make poor financial decisions and end up disappointed in ourselves and perhaps a little bit bitter towards the whole “permaculture thing.” Be honest with yourself and be realistic. If being realistic means not buying a large property or just focusing on designing a small garden patch in front of your house, then that is your appropriate scale. Stay small at first. Scaling up isn’t always the best choice right off the bat. Even on a large property, you can scale down approaches like orchards, swales, and field crops and concentrate them in a small food forest garden that can be observed, learned from, and expanded at a later time if needed. In permaculture, we often use an approach called “design by chunking”. This means that we don’t need to plan the entire project in detail to begin with. We pick a small section and develop that first, before moving on with implementing other sections of our design. ​Smaller scale being more efficient is backed up by a UN study. The IAASTD report on the future of world agriculture was written in response to the question: “How are we going to feed the world?” It was expected to find out that the answer was biotechnology and agro-industry, i.e. genetic engineering and industrial scale farms growing monocrops.  Instead, its main findings included: Here is a selection of big land permaculture projects around the world.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of global permaculture projects. It is meant only as a sampler to show you a range of examples. As you explore, consider how everything you have learned about permaculture and design so far is different when applied to big land versus an urban or suburban site. ​Nettle Valley Farm. Spring Grove, Minnesota, USA. Woodland is the natural habitat for pigs. Having access to woodland means the pigs find most of the food they need from the wide variety of plants and grubs available. Rotational grazing means there isn’t a build up of parasites, so both the pigs and the pastures/wooded areas are healthier. The design for Nettle Farm, located in the Midwestern USA, incorporates rotational grazing for the pigs through both pasture and woodland.​ Llananant Farm, Monmouthshire, Wales, UK. The nant (stream) from the farm’s name runs through the middle of the farm. Because the stream is a permanent feature that can’t be relocated, it made sense to create zone  across the middle of the farm. With help from an agri-environment scheme, a swathe of land either side of the stream has been fenced off and is now a strip of woodland. The advantages are that it provides shade, shelter and browsing for livestock in the fields on both sides of the woodland. The trees include alder, a nitrogen-fixer that is particularly nutritious for browsing stock, and willow, a natural source of salicylic acid (aspirin). The woodland also provides a haven for wildlife, increases biodiversity, and helps prevent flooding. Vergenoeg Project, Namibia. Vergenoeg, Eastern Namibia. Anna-Marta of Permaculture Namibia’s Vergenoeg Project talks in this video about how training opportunities can empower women.

Rakai, Southern Uganda. On a  acre site, Sabina School accommodates  children from the surrounding area, where HIV/AIDS has had a devastating impact. One result is that children may not learn essential skills from their parents. To address this, and to help make the school sustainable, an ambitious permaculture design is being applied to the whole site, and part of the design is that it is integrated fully into the daily life and education of the children.​ ​Palestinian farmers use permaculture to challenge occupation.

 When it comes to economic systems, the truth of the matter is we really don’t know what an alternative could look like because most of us haven’t had the chance to practice much but capitalism on a large scale.  Even alternative systems, such as most of what we will share today, still focus on the notion of capital, of getting something, and it’s possible that this fundamental tendency in humans, the need to GET and to OWN, will be the very thing we need to shift if we are to find a way to be a sustainable species on this planet. Also, FYI: this article explores a lot of different ideas around money, economics, and related ideas, and we’ll spend some time trying to imagine a reality we may never see…but that doesn’t mean we don’t recognize the very real truth that sometimes you just need some actual CASH for your permaculture project.

With a set of tools known as “ecological footprint,” “environmental footprint, “carbon footprint,” “water footprint,” etc. These simple assessments allow us to see, on a personal, regional, national, and global scale, how much out of balance we are and, theoretically, give us a starting point from which to tip the odds back toward sustainability.

As we wind down our year together, it’s time to focus on your whole system design project. ​If you’re really going for it, this will include a plan for sharing information with others, about your project and about permaculture in general. This article is an invitation to consider the less-obvious aspects of that work, namely: are you accidentally putting people off by being too vague, aggressive and/or not meeting them where they’re at? Permaculture, like anything else humans invent, may quickly devolve into jargon and elitism without applying some very basic tenets about how we communicate, especially when teaching or explaining a concept. So…don’t let it happen! Resist the temptation to “permavangelize” and focus on creating simple, hands-on experiences so that learners can truly embody this wisdom, rather than just hearing about it. Share your surplus information, tools, and resources, for the benefit of others, and share the conversation too. Listen more than you talk, and use what you learn to refine your focus. And, while we’re doling out unsolicited behavioral advice: No matter what, always focus at least % of your “permaculture time” on design and implementation.  For every hour you spend talking, reading, social media-ing about permaculture, spend another hour working with the land, helping others, and regenerating living systems. Hands in the soil. Daily. Karryn Olson works with a diversity of permaculture people and she also studies business and marketing. She sees what type of “permaculture outreach” (which is really just marketing, if you think about it) works…and what doesn’t. Check out her article here, about common mistakes people make when they finish a permaculture course. DO’s DON’Ts: If you’re finding opportunities to permavangelize, it’s likely because you’re attending public events. And sometimes the “evangelical” style of outreach can just be a result of nervousness about being out in public and meeting so many new people. The fastest way to relax, find your center, and stay focused on the facts is by gaining true confidence in your abilities as a public speaker.

"Access to land to unleash your creative spirit is a birthright. It is us claiming our place or role within this great story. It is us articulating our widening sense of self that includes other humans and the natural world. And we do not need to own land to be able to find ways to use it for earth care, people care and fair share. May your roots be nourished and nourishing in all the places you choose to walk. Even if you are stuck in a massive city, with no land to your name, there are a myriad of creative ways you can practice permaculture. And painting public walls to build community is just one of them.”
​–Ridhi D’Cruz  This section by Marit Parker. “An American friend living in Germany told me a story about when she first arrived. She and her German boyfriend were out walking when she heard a noise that got louder as they approached the town’s main square. Puzzled, she asked her partner about the unfamiliar sound. “That’s the sound of people talking to each other,” he told her. People outside, not drowned out by the noise of cars or amplified music. Imagine!” Placemaking is about reclaiming public spaces and recreating a sense of community in places where it has been lost. In many places, town and city centres have become commercialised. Public spaces are designed to keep traffic and people moving. Dawdling is frowned upon so, for example, if you want to sit down you have to buy a coffee. Being constantly on the move, rushing from one appointment to the next deadline, leaves little scope for meeting people and chatting. But there are simple tweaks to designs and layouts that can change this. In some places it is known as “reclaiming the commons”, or as one person put it, “making Public Space a Living Space.” Here are a few examples of people using, creating and reclaiming public spaces, from small to large:  The Fearless Collective  Creating space to move from fear to love through participatory art. Happy to Chat Allison Owen-Jones noticed an elderly man sitting alone for nearly an hour on a park bench near her home in Cardiff, Wales. She came up with the idea of tying a sign that would open the avenues for people. The sign said “Happy to chat bench. Sit here if you don’t mind someone stopping to say hello.“ Here’s Ridhi D’Cruz, who co-directs the City Repair project in Portland, Oregon. In this video, Ridhi takes us on a tour of her place and shows us some of the things she has done with City Repair to create a village within the city. With their free public meals, Food Not Bombs has been making places for people all over the world for  years now. They have been instrumental in the survival of Berkeley’s People’s Park, which provides safe space an community interaction for thousands of people every day. The American Indian Centre in Chicago holds regular Indigenous Science days where people of all ages can learn about and reclaim traditional practices and knowledge. Using outdoor sites across Chicago, participants get involved with land restoration and management including planting and harvesting.  The AIC strives to be the primary cultural and community resource for over , Native Americans in the greater Chicago metropolitan area. Chicago is home to the third largest urban NA population with over  tribal nations represented.  ​“We create alternative, people-led narratives that engage personal histories, cultural and political realities and tell stories of universal resilience through visual campaigning, workshops and affirmative storytelling techniques.” In Detroit, some urban dwellers have made placemaking a part of their daily practice: Residents of the La Latina neighbourhood in Madrid took over a site earmarked for the construction of a public facility, converting it into a meeting place for a wide-ranging series of events including inflatable pools, open-air cinema and neighbourhood breakfasts. Outdoor pianos spread joy and invite connection around the world, and they are, relatively speaking, a very easy placemaking experiment. Little free public libraries are easy to install and add a whimsical, beautiful place for people to stop, rest, learn, and exchange resources and information. Lordship Rec in Tottenham London is an inspiring and well-used example of what a community can do in the face of overwhelming challenges. This large park sits between two large council estates, including Broadwater Farm, a horrible example of s concrete tower architecture that gained the label of the worst place to live in the s. Heavy policing resulted in rising racial tension and eventually riots in , and the area continues to be under constant surveillance. In contrast, the Lordship Rec has been transformed into a lively hub of community activities and outdoor spaces with a straw bale community centre and cafe, a lake, bike tracks, gardens, wildlife areas and an outdoor stage for performances. There is a busy calendar of events and the park is also used by many people of all ages as simply a nice place to hang out and relax. And this all came about because a group of local residents started asking everyone using the park “How can our park be improved?” The Portland City Repair project hosts an annual Village Building Convergence, which occurs in hundreds of locations around the city all at once.

"“Ecofeminism is the idea that the oppression of women and the exploitation of our planet’s natural resources are inextricably linked.” —Aiofe Coyne  “Wherever women acted against ecological destruction or/and the threat of atomic annihilation, they immediately became aware of the connection between patriarchal violence against women, other people and nature, and that: In defying this patriarchy we are loyal to future generations and to life and this planet itself. We have a deep and particular understanding of this both through our natures and our experience as women”…this quote comes from this article, which gives lots of links and things to think about. ​Ecofeminists posit that the current state of our global environment is a direct result of patriarchal control of resources and industry, for centuries. The way men treat women, in general, is exactly aligned with the way they treat the planet: like a commodity for them to use…and to kill.  Vandana Shiva is perhaps the most “famous” ecofeminist. In the video below, she discusses her perspectives. Also check out this interview. It should be obvious by now, but basically: this has EVERYTHING to do with permaculture.

"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” 
–Buckminster Fuller this section by Silvia Di Blasio ​​Social permaculture includes how we host ourselves and others, how we face challenges, make decisions and govern ourselves in non-hierarchical, non-oppressive ways. It shares the systems’ view of life that is central to permaculture design and includes ever-evolving practices, methodologies and ways of thinking that will stretch your edges and expand your sense of connection, compassion and belonging. The Art of Hosting (AoH) is a series of practices, ways of thinking and methodologies to facilitate addressing challenges and decisions collectively. ​There are no leaders in the AoH, only hosts. As the name indicates, the AoH is an art that considers how each one of us host ourselves and how we host others. It covers how we show up, dress, behave, listen and respond, participate and contribute, and how we acknowledge, observe and respect the land, and the history and the peoples (human and non-human) who are hosting us.  ​​If you have had the opportunity to engage in community work, group work in any type of organization or even be part of a permablitz, project or gathering, you may have noticed that things may not always go as you expect: people are always at the center of any decision-making process, design, communication and governance processes and those processes are what represent the challenge. Although we may not lack the technology, skills, strategies, methods and resources to move forward, we need people on the same page if we want to achieve anything. This applies not only to community projects but to households, couples, groups and organizations of any kind. Here’s an introduction to the practice overall: The Art of Hosting is a lexicon of participatory methods dedicated to building connections and fostering teamwork in community. The methods and group processes, activities and strategies that may fall under the Art of Hosting are almost endless and are ever-evolving as we learn and discover new ways to do things together. There is no one-size-fits-all in working with people. The decision of what to use will depend on various factors, including: Here is an overview of techniques that could be combined with or used instead of AoH: The Circle Way. This is an alternative infrastructure for collaborative conversations. Created by Christina Baldwin, the circle has ancient roots in women and village circles from many cultures. The circle can be used as a tool in itself or as a checking in and/or checking out process. It is better for small groups of people who know each other well or share a goal or values, but can be used for almost any issues and time-frames. It has some core components, as follows. Three principles: Three practices: The circle way also shares some basic agreements that are always clarified at the beginning: World Cafe ​The world cafe is a process to foster interaction and dialogue with both large and small groups. It is better used for exploring possibilities, as a huge brain-storm that includes many layers of questions going deeper and deeper. It also fosters interaction and dialogue and helps to survey the collective wisdom of a group or community. It can be adapted to many formats and purposes such as information sharing, relationship building, deep exploration on a topic and action planning. The World Cafe operating principles are summarized here: The general flow of a World Cafe in six basic steps Open Space Technology (OST) OST is useful in many contexts, including strategic direction-setting, visioning, conflict resolution, morale building, consultation with stakeholders, community planning, etc. The goal of OST is to create a space for people to engage deeply and creatively around issues that concern them. These issues may be challenging or involve diverse stakeholders, may involve complex elements, presence of passion (and potential for conflict). OST may be employed when there is a need for a quick decision. Some of the principles present in OST include: The group usually convenes in a circle. The facilitator provides an overview of the process and explains how it works. The facilitator invites people with concern to come into the circle, write the issue on a piece of paper and announce it to the group. These people become the conveners. They place their papers on a wall and choose a time and place to meet. This process continues until there’s no more agenda items. The group is then invited to break up and go to the agenda items they are more interested in discussing. Once the items have been discussed in the different groups, everyone will move into convergence again: they would attach the different discussions to action plans that may happen outside of the space and time (next steps, committees and commitments). Pro-Action Cafe In the Pro-Action Cafe, participants are invited to bring their call, project, ideas or questions. It is a blend between World Cafe and Open Space Technology. It is great as a cross-pollinator of ideas, projects, etc. and useful for garnering support for existing issues and projects. Similar to the process in OST, people start in a circle. Those with ideas, questions or projects are invited to write them down and present them. They may want to have a pitch to engage people. The group is usually divided by four (so, in the case of  participants, you can only have up to  callers of ideas/projects per session). The principle is first come, first served: people go to the topics that interest them until the chairs or spaces are full and they need to choose a different topic/idea. ​The participants will stay with the caller for - minutes at each table/space and then move to another one until everyone has sat at each table and contributed. This way, the caller can go deeper and deeper with each round and get ideas and feedback or support for her project from each round of diverse participants. Collective Story Harvest This process was developed by Mary-Alice Arthur for the Art of Hosting processes. It invites active involvement of all the present and is usually shared as a story. The story holders tell a story and the members of the audience listen actively from the perspective of a specific question or focus. This is called targeted listening. How it works: First you need a story of a process or change that is happening in a community, group or relationship dynamic. Then, try to have the voices and perspectives from more than one person involved in the story. The average time is  minutes, but if you are doing this for the first time or with people who don’t have experience, you may want to keep the story-telling part no longer than  minutes. Decide beforehand with the storytellers, what you want to get out of the process and what will happen with the harvest once it is done. You’ll need at least one person harvesting each arch as this needs to happen simultaneously. Some arcs to choose from: Theater of the Oppressed August Boal was a theater director who believed improvisational games could have a powerful influence on how deeply and quickly humans developed creative relationships. Together with people in workshops all around the world, he co-created hundreds of interactive games that can be done with any group of people.

 This section written by Marit Parker. Planning a permaculture design requires that we learn to “read the land.” Reading the land takes time. And that’s good, because if you’re planning a major change, you don’t want to rush into it and then realise you’ve changed your mind or made a mistake. Different seasons bring opportunities for different observations, so in summer you may notice some places where plant growth is lush, and others where it’s drier and plants take measures to conserve water. In winter, frost and frozen water can reveal different patterns and hints about what lies underneath. Sun and shade are of course important factors, and taking time means you can observe the plot when the sun is at its highest and lowest points in the sky, at opposite ends of the yearly cycle, and all the points in between. What is growing in different areas also gives clues to attributes such as where water is flowing through the land, and where the soil is fertile. Get to know the weeds in your plot and find out what they can tell you about the soil, the availability of water, and the microclimate. Seeing all the creatures that live in your plot can be harder, as many stay hidden. However, you may spot tracks, poo, webs or shells, for example. What different habitats are there and where? What does this tell you about the site? Don’t forget to look at your plot in its context with neighbouring areas. If you have a slope, what happens above and below it? Where does water come from and go to? Look at its historical context. What has happened here before? What changes have been made in the past? This could include changes due to human activity, such as buildings erected or pulled down, paths or roads made, trees planted or felled. Or it could be changes due to physical factors such as fire, erosion, flooding or drought. Seeing places in their historical context can bring a different perspective to our observations, the long view. We may start to appreciate different aspects in terms of their relative permanence. This may help us consider our own efforts differently, in terms of their own relative permanence. It may become apparent that, for example, a damp depression probably used to be a pond that has filled in over time. How does this change how you see the land? As your understanding of your plot deepens, start considering what effect changes might have. What might happen if you change where water goes? How will it affect your neighbours? How will it affect plants and animals living near the water now? As you become more aware of all the different forms of life passing through or living in or near your plot, all of whom will be affected in different ways by your plans, it can become difficult to know what to do for the best. Are the projects you want to do going to enhance the land, or will it cost too much in terms of disrupting, or even destroying, existing niches and habitat? Many of these potential upsets can be offset working by hand instead of using machines. Working by hand means it is possible to introduce changes gradually, allowing time for more learning about and reading the land as you work, allowing time for those affected by the changes to adapt, and also allowing some flexibility if you realise your plans could benefit from some changes. Major changes to plans, once they have been started, are more difficult, so it is worth taking time not only to read the land but also to mull over the work you want to do, the effort it will take, the effects it may have. The scale of permanence is a tool you can use to gather information, analyze opportunities, and prioritize components that will have the biggest impact for the least effort. It is also a tool to measure the potential for error, and to avoid making huge ones. As you can see, landform is hard to change and repair, and soil is super easy to ruin (and repair), and most of your landscape changes will affect both, so think hard before you start digging! Here’s a thorough, if slightly meandering, video explanation of SOP and how it connects to making changes to your landscape, from Richard Perkins When you make changes to the landscape, do you consider how long those changes will last, and/or what the long-term impact of those changes will be? Also, when you plan your timeline for implementing your design ideas, it becomes clear that some tasks (repair damaged soil) will take much longer to accomplish than others (plant strawberries)…and by the same token: some mistakes (strawberries planted in the wrong spot) will only take a few minutes to remedy, while others (adding toxins to soil) will take many years to correct. ​As such, when we use something called a “Scale of Permanence” to organize our thoughts and actions, we can avoid big mistakes and create a workable, conscious timeline for our design project. There are a few versions of the Scale of Permanence since P.A. Yeoman, but he was the first to frame it as such. His understanding of a site’s hydrology left an impact on the world and is important for permaculture designers to understand.  The idea is that you rank components from easiest to change or influence (and thus easiest to correct if you make a misguided design decision) to hardest to change (once you’ve changed the climate, for example, it will take a huge effort to change it back), and then observe and analyze the site with those rankings in mind. The SOP gives us a way to organize our observations, and to envision the potential impacts of any changes we’d like to make. Try creating a set of questions and observations that follow this pattern.

"What is permaculture? Here's an expansive Permaculture FAQ with a collection of helpful links to help you on your permaculture learning journey. by Heather Jo Flores What is permaculture? Originally coined as a blend of “Permanent Agriculture,” the term permaculture has evolved over the last five decades to embody a community and practice much broader than just farming. Permaculture is a form of sustainable design science that focuses on creating robust ecosystems modeled after natural ones. Sometimes referred to as “ecological design,” this practice is geared towards building self-reliant, resilient human communities that enhance rather than deplete the environment. Permaculture champions the use of organic materials and natural gardening techniques to set up ecosystems capable of meeting human necessities like food, water, shelter, and energy. This involves growing specific types of plants such as fruit and nut trees and adopting techniques like agroforestry and food forests. It equips individuals with the tools they need to design systems that are beneficial for both human beings and the planet. Permaculture promotes a mindset of working in harmony with nature to create self-sustaining systems. The goal is to obtain what humans require while safeguarding the environment. If the concept of permaculture seems a bit overwhelming or theoretical, remember it’s more about the journey than the destination. It’s not a product, it’s a process. To navigate the practical and theoretical sides of permaculture, a core set of ethics guides the practice. There are three primary principles: Earth Care, emphasizing the protection and renewal of natural resources; People Care, which nurtures individual and community well-being; and a variation of Fair Share, advocating for equitable resource distribution and surplus sharing. Alternate interpretations of the Fair Share ethic range from “Limits to Growth and Consumption,” proposed by Mollison, to “Careful Process” by Bloom and Boehnlein, “Future Care” by Harland, and more. ​Ok so, what is permaculture? The short answer:
It’s ecological design. The long answer:
“Permaculture” as a practice, simply means observing nature, researching tools and techniques used by indigenous people in your bioregion, and engaging in a diligent, daily practice of balancing the needs of yourself and your family with those of the other species all around you. All of us have this knowing inside of us, and the ecological design process is about uncovering that knowing, and applying it to our physical, social, and emotional landscapes, with the goal of creating living, evolving systems that mimic nature, produce food and energy, and regenerate, rather than annihilate, the Earth. But it’s still got something to do with gardening, right? Yes, gardening is part of any ecological design, because plants are a part of life. Without them, we die. So, if we are creating systems in which we can thrive and be of help to other species, then we have to include plants! But we must never stop there. The garden inspires us, feeds us, connects us to nature…and then we have to get to work on the rest of the system. Because permaculture designers transform scarcity into abundance. The ecological design process balances human needs with the needs of other species. An ecological design creates systems made up of organisms, mechanisms, and feedback. Plus, it’s super fun and personally rewarding. You can: It’s a common misconception that you need to own land to practice permaculture. One of the great advantages of ecological design is that it can be applied to any space, whether it is a small urban balcony or a large rural farm. Examples of successful permaculture projects can be found across various land sizes. Urban rooftops can be transformed into productive spaces by applying vertical gardening techniques, container gardening, and planting perennial plants. Suburban backyard gardens can incorporate permaculture garden ideas by integrating fruit trees, vegetable beds, and integrated pest management techniques. And of course, larger rural farms can implement food forests and broad-scale conservation strategies that create and regenerate habitat for myriad species. Permaculture and organic gardening share a common goal of growing food without chemicals. But growing food is only one very small part of permaculture. Permaculture goes beyond organic gardening by incorporating conscious design and observation as integral parts of the process. It is a holistic approach that aims to create self-sustaining and regenerative systems, not only in the garden but also in all aspects of life. Permaculture and regenerative agriculture share many similarities and intersections, yet they are not the same concept. Regenerative agriculture focuses specifically on restoring and improving the health of agricultural systems. It employs a range of practices such as cover cropping, rotational grazing, and organic soil management to regenerate soil health, enhance biodiversity, and increase resilience to climate change. This approach acknowledges that agriculture can have a positive impact on the environment, and aims to move beyond merely reducing harm to actually improving ecosystems. Permaculture extends beyond agriculture to encompass the design and integration of sustainable systems in all aspects of human habitation. Permaculture design principles can be applied to a wide range of disciplines, such as architecture, energy systems, water management, and community development. While permaculture and regenerative agriculture share common goals, permaculture serves as a holistic framework for conscious design and harmonious integration of natural systems within all aspects of life. It emphasizes self-sufficiency, closed-loop processes, and the use of natural materials. This broader, whole-systems approach sets permaculture apart. As such, organic gardening, regenerative agriculture, silviculture, carbon farming, and all other eco-farming teachniques can fall under the umbrella of permaculture, but on their own, none of these techniques have as much power and potential as a whole-system design.  Permaculture aims to establish balanced, fruitful ecosystems by thoughtfully crafting systems that resemble the natural world. This method places a strong focus on biodiversity, environmental conservation, and soil restoration. This makes it a far more sustainable choice compared to traditional ways of farming and resource extraction. A key tenet of permaculture is the deployment of a wide array of plants and animals to forge stable, resilient ecosystems. For instance, introducing a mix of plant species and beneficial insects can help gardens and farms naturally fend off pests and diseases. This cuts down the need for synthetic fertilizers and chemical pesticides. This focus on biodiversity further bolsters the resilience and overall well-being of the ecosystem. When it comes to farming, permaculture leans on practices like intercropping and agroforestry, which drastically reduce the necessity for heavy irrigation and rule out the need for harmful chemical additives. Intercropping involves planting different crops in proximity to make optimal use of space and nutrients. Agroforestry combines trees and shrubs with crops, leveraging their natural abilities to provide shade and recycle nutrients. These methods enhance crop yields while lowering water consumption and minimizing the need for chemical fertilizers. Furthermore, soil restoration is a top priority in permaculture. Techniques such as composting, mulching, and cover cropping work to elevate soil fertility, improve water-holding capacity, and boost the overall vigor of the soil ecosystem. With healthy soils, farms are less dependent on external resources and can better adapt to changes in climate. Overall, permaculture’s focus on biodiversity, environmental conservation, and soil renewal positions it as an extremely sustainable strategy for both agriculture and land management. It reduces dependency on water, pesticides, and deforestation, all while nurturing long-term ecological health and productivity. Here’s a fascinating paper: Permaculture—Scientific Evidence of Principles for the Agroecological Design of Farming Systems The answer is yes. There are as many ways to make a living with permaculture as there are fruit trees in the food forest! Permaculture offers a multitude of income opportunities for those willing to embrace its principles. The key to making a living with permaculture is diversification. By combining multiple income streams, you can observe the natural principle of redundancy and create a stable and sustainable livelihood, all while contributing to a more harmonious integration between human habitats and natural ecosystems. Organic market farming is the most obvious example. Fruits, vegetables, seeds–all of those yummy chemical-free organic crops have a high value in a market hungry for environmentally conscious food. Additionally, offering permaculture design services is another viable income stream. As people become more aware of the need for sustainable living, there is increasing demand for permaculture designers who can help individuals and communities create productive ecosystems that mimic natural systems. Many designers also earn money teaching permaculture courses. If you choose to go this route, be sure to get some training in the teaching of permaculture, not just the design strategies. Also, depending where you live, providing permaculture consulting services can be a profitable venture. Many individuals and organizations may require guidance and advice on how to integrate permaculture principles into their existing operations. By offering consulting services, permaculture experts can assist them in transitioning towards more sustainable practices. However, while permaculture courses teach a generalist way of seeing the world through an ecological lens, if you want to make a good living in permaculture you’ll probably need to find a niche. Most of the most successful eco-entrepreneurs have found a specific niche market that works for their particular area of expertise.  Check out this free/donation-based online course about how to find your profitable, ethical eco-niche. Bill Mollison, often credited as the “founder of permaculture,” was an Australian traveler, scientist, baker, fisherman, gardener, autodidact, and writer who researched and published extensive genealogies of Indigenous Australians, and through this work he became inspired to dedicate the rest of his life to learning and teaching integrated ways for humans to live on the planet without destroying it. Mollison worked with many people and wrote, co-wrote, and inspired many books, organized hundreds of courses, and traveled all over the world collecting and sharing information about ecological design. He was especially enchanted with the notion of agricultural systems working together with human home systems so that each meets the needs of the other, and collaborated on a huge array of visionary design drawings with his then-colleague and illustrator, Reny Slay. Mollison was also influenced by writers who had come before him, such as Rachel Carson (Silent Spring, ), Ken & Barbara Kern (The Owner-Built Home, ), P.A. Yeomans (Water for Every Farm, ), and J. Russel Smith, who wrote Tree Crops for a Permanent Agriculture (), the title credited with sparking the idea to call it “perma-culture.” And guess what? Many of the exact ideas Mollison presented in his early books can also be found in the above four books. Read them and see for yourself. He did NOT invent this concept and neither did any of his students! Indeed, throughout his life until he died in , Mollison consistently pointed back to his sources and reiterated that he did not “own” any of these ideas, and that this type of knowledge can not and should not be owned. In all of his work, we see an ethical and practical reliance on a fairly short list of ecological design principles, summarized here from his early writing: We’ll come back around to these principles and many more, but for now can you see how these ideas could help you to design not only a garden and homestead, but also a social and emotional landscape that is more resilient, abundant, and safe than the current (degenerative) systems in which most of us now exist?  Permaculture is a sustainable living methodology aimed at creating harmonious integration between humans and the natural environment. Although some may argue that permaculture has cult-like characteristics, it is essential to analyze its principles and practices to determine its true nature. Permaculture’s focus on sustainable living through Earth Care, People Care, and Fair Share distinguishes it from cult-like practices and emphasizes its commitment to creating a regenerative and fairer world. Some misconceptions about it being a cult arise due to its close-knit community and the passionate (and often quite vocal) dedication of its practitioners. However, permaculture’s foundations are grounded in scientific principles and practices. Its approach is based on observing and mimicking natural ecosystems and principles, utilizing renewable resources, and minimizing waste. Contrary to cult-like practices, permaculture emphasizes conscious design and encourages individuals to adapt its principles to their local climate and culture. It is not an exclusive group with a leader but rather a community of like-minded individuals, educators, and designers who share knowledge and promote sustainable living practices. So, while some may perceive the community to be cult-like due to certain patterns of interactions in a few particular areas of the world (and the interwebs) it’s important to remember that there are a huge diversity of people practicing and teaching permaculture, and it’s worth it to look deeper for a niche in the learning community that feels right for your needs. There are certainly a handful of would-be cult leaders in the online permaculture sphere, so it’s a good idea to do your due diligence while looking for a place to learn. While you explore, be mindful and focus on finding a space that keeps its foundations in scientific principles and ethical guidelines, while avoiding spaces that “permavangelize,” or preach permaculture as the “one true path.” Even Bill Mollison, the permaculture teacher who created the Internationally-respected Permaculture Design Course curriculum, consistently advised against becoming dogmatic about it. Permaculture, by definition, defies both ownership and large-scale leadership. Permaculture is a set of actions and strategies based on site-specific, climate-aware, community-invested ecologies. In this sense, leadership beyond the immediate stakeholders is not practical nor is it possible. Permaculture is about personal responsibility, thoughtful action, and careful, ecological design. It is about science, evidence, and results. Your teachers are just the messengers, and a good design needs no teacher’s approval, because a good design validates itself through the integrity of the ecological systems it perpetuates. Like any concept, philosophy, or land-use practice permaculture is not without its flaws and the best permaculture designers are the ones who face these limitations head-on. To a trained permaculture designer, looking at “what permaculture got wrong” is simply another tool for learning how to get it right. One criticism of permaculture is its potential for being overly idealistic and impractical. While permaculture principles aim to mimic natural systems and create harmonious integration, implementing these designs on a larger scale can face challenges. The complex interconnections of natural environments make it difficult to replicate. Furthermore, some critics argue that permaculture can be hard to implement in urban or heavily populated areas, where land availability and regulatory restrictions may pose barriers. The concept of permaculture design, which emphasizes natural materials and closed-loop systems, may not always be feasible or cost-effective in such environments, and can be especially inaccessible to the people who might need it most–the poor. Another area where permaculture has faced criticism is its limited focus on invasive plants and pests. While permaculture aims to create productive ecosystems, the lack of attention to invasive species management can lead to unintended consequences and ecological imbcalance for native plants and animal species. Despite these criticisms and limitations, it is important to recognize that permaculture has achieved success in many instances. The flaws and challenges within permaculture design do not discount its potential as a powerful tool for achieving sustainability and conscious design. It is incumbent upon permaculture designers to continually evolve and adapt the approach to address these limitations and create more effective and resilient systems. There are many places to learn more about becoming an ecological designer. You can learn these skills on any schedule and with any budget, and start applying the concepts in your daily life right away. For the purpose of this article, we’ll provide a quick overview of free and paid options.. Learning permaculture for free is as easy as signing up for the Permaculture for Beginners course online. You’ll be amazed at how much you get and how much you learn, and from there you can follow the recommended resources to an array of learning opportunities for your permaculture research adventure!  If you prefer learning from books, go to your public library and request a copy of any of these books, then read them cover to cover: One of the best ways to get an introduction to permaculture is by joining one of the many online permaculture communities found on social media networks and hosted by permaculture associations around the world. Online permaculture communities provide a platform for individuals to connect with like-minded individuals and share their experiences and knowledge about permaculture. These communities play a crucial role in spreading awareness and facilitating learning and collaboration among enthusiasts of sustainable living. By joining these communities, individuals can learn from the experiences and expertise of others, discover innovative techniques and practices, and stay updated with the latest trends in permaculture. Connecting with like-minded individuals creates a supportive network where members can seek advice, share success stories, and find inspiration for their own projects. The first online permaculture community most people come across is Permies, an active forum with thousands of users and endless lists of comments going back over a decade. Another popular community is the Permaculture Global Network, a platform that enables users to connect with permaculture practitioners worldwide, with more of a professional emphasis. There’s also the Eco Design Hive, a free public forum that offers a marketplace area, a local connections board, and a range of online permaculture courses for students of all levels of experience. You’ll also find a plethora of permaculture groups on Facebook, though these tend to be riddled with trolling and spam, so it’s hit or miss. For a safe bet, check out the groups hosted by the Free Permaculture network. The UI, features, and overall “vibe” of each of these forums is radically different, so explore them all and find a space that feels right for you. A Permaculture Design Course (aka “PDC”), if done correctly, provides students with a life-changing transformation that will forever improve their interactions with the natural world. This course provides a holistic understanding of permaculture principles, design methods, and practical techniques. In-person courses happen all over the world and usually involve camping out in a rural setting and practicing the ideas on a shared design project with a small group of cohorts. The students benefit greatly from the real-time interaction but the most common complaint about these courses is that the students don’t really get a chance to design the place where they actually live. Also, the in-person courses can be terribly expensive to attend, especially once you calculate in the travel expenses, time off work, and so on. Online permaculture design courses are also fairly common, but it can be a bit harder to determine which are offered by legitimate teachers and/or which provide enough support for the student to actually achieve the “permaculture transformation” of both their garden and their mind. Whether online or in-person, most teachers offer a free “Introduction to Permaculture” course, and it’s highly recommended you sample a few of these before making the investment in their full PDC. In general, student feedback about learning permaculture online is exceedingly positive because the students enjoy having the time and space to work on designs that are relevant to their own homes and lives. No two PDCs are alike, and the quality of them varies widely, but they all (should) contain the same basic curriculum to conform with the International guidelines. The easiest way to check and make sure a PDC follows this curriculum is to choose one that has been reviewed by a rd party such as a Permaculture Association. If you go with a course that seems to be run by a lone wolf, your chances of overpaying for a sub-par experience (and missing out on a big transformation) are much higher. To obtain permaculture certification, individuals need to complete a PDC. This course covers various aspects of permaculture, including natural ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, organic gardening, and renewable resources. It equips learners with the skills and knowledge required to apply permaculture principles in their own projects. Permaculture certification is meaningful because it implies that the teacher of that course has interacted with you directly, has reviewed your assignments, and can confirm that you fundamentally understand the core ideas around ecological design. However, it’s important to understand that a “permaculture certificate” is simply a certificate of completion. All it says is that you took the course. The value of any one permaculture certificate over another is arbitrary, because there is no such thing as a central “permaculture certification board” or anything like it. What you will find, instead, is an assortment of regional and international Permaculture Institutes and Associations who work collectively to keep teachers accountable so that the certificates actually mean something. This is another reason to, as mentioned above, seek training with permaculture teachers who indicate they are a member of a Permaculture Association and can demonstrate that their curriculum has been reviewed accordingly. You can certainly find permaculture courses online that offer a certificate but do not provide any feedback about your design work, but you have to take that with a grain of salt. Does this mean you shouldn’t pay the  bucks to watch those  hours of video on Udemy? No! You should for sure watch those videos. Just…don’t stop there. Go and earn your certificate with the support and supervision of a dedicated professional permaculture educator, and you’ll see why it matters. Earning your PDC is a way to make sure you’ve covered all the bases as you assemble your permaculture beginner’s toolkit. You can certainly learn permaculture on your own, from books, and through hands-on practice in your own context. But when you willfully invest in a learning experience that was created by an impassioned teacher, you not only help that teacher keep teaching, you’re also paying into a healthier economy. You’re helping the movement grow and putting your money where your mouth is, so that the next generation of students can do the same. So yes, permaculture certification holds great significance in the permaculture community. It allows individuals to obtain recognition for their expertise in sustainable and regenerative agriculture systems, offering opportunities for professional development, career advancement, and credibility.  For those who have already completed a PDC or have a specific area of interest within permaculture, niche-specific classes are also available. These courses delve deeper into particular topics such as food forests, natural building techniques, or regenerative agriculture. Taking these classes allows you to gain specialized knowledge and skills that can be applied to your own permaculture projects. Whether you choose to pursue a traditional PDC, explore more niche-specific classes, or both, the options for learning permaculture are vast. Take the time to research and find the courses that align with your goals and interests. By investing in your education, you can gain the knowledge and skills needed to create sustainable and regenerative systems in your own backyard or community. Whether you choose to go for permaculture certification or not, learning about permaculture is guaranteed to improve your garden, your home space, and your relationships. Taking a permaculture design course can be a valuable investment for individuals interested in creating sustainable and regenerative systems. These courses provide comprehensive knowledge and practical skills that go beyond traditional gardening or agriculture techniques. But what if you just really don’t have the money? Is it worth it to go into debt to learn permaculture? if you lack the funds to invest in a Permaculture Design Course but you feel that permaculture certification could benefit your personal and/or professional life, you have a couple of options. Many people do a small crowdfunding campaign to ask friends and family for tuition money, sometimes in lieu of holiday or graduation gifts. You can offer design work, after the fact, as rewards to the people who donate to your training. You can also try to find a teacher who is willing to do a work-trade with you in exchange for tuition. this is very common, especially for in-person courses. Contact them well in advance, as these positions tend to fill up quickly. In general, out of all the things you spend your money on, investing in a Permaculture Design Course is unlikely to be at the top of your list of regrets. Most graduates consider it to have been well worth the money for a transformation that would have otherwise perhaps been missed entirely. Go here for an article about different ways to do fundraising, not just for your education but also for your permaculture projects now and in the future. Here’s the point where I could give you a rundown of the top-rated online permaculture design courses, but really I just want to tell you to enroll in mine! It’s the culmination of  years of experience and I created it to address what I see as the shortcomings of the other online programs (namely, that they are too focused on people who own big land and inaccessible to the rest of us!) So here it is: Our Online Permaculture Design Course offers rolling enrollment, so you can go at your own pace, and finish within a few months or take up to a year. We give you a template and walk you through creating your own, actionable permaculture plan. But more importantly: we make sure you experience the mindset transformation that makes permaculture so powerful. Through our streamlined, accessible curriculum and ongoing support through both public and private forums, our program is designed to help you really “get it” as an ecological designer, quickly, without getting bogged down in dogma or utopian fantasy. Our course is practical and focused on helping normal working folks (who don’t own big land or have tons of money) take daily action towards a more sustainable life.   This beautiful documentary explores some of the ideas about where permaculture techniques came from and reminds us how much we can learn from some indigenous cultures, about caring for nature.

" (For a thorough explanation of the permaculture ethics, and the “Heather Jo Flores assertion” about what the third ethic should be, read this article.) However, though we learn and teach about the “permaculture ethics” in every class, course, and workshop, we too often discuss these ethics as if they are apart from ourselves, and herein lies the rub: if we are not willing to strictly adhere to these ethics ourselves, and to make a commitment, as permaculture designers at whatever level of expertise, to BE the change, rather than just preaching about it, then we’re wasting our time.​ Ok…but HOW?​ Through your relationship with the land.  Access to land, gaining it, sharing it, maintaining it, and respecting it are the core ingredients that make permaculture possible. Even if you’re absolutely focused on Social Permaculture, you’re still sleeping somewhere, eating somewhere and, whether you acknowledge it or not, deeply connected to the solid ground on which you conduct your day-to-day existence. If you can’t find a space to practice your permaculture ideas, you’re not gonna get very far. Yes, of course you can grow pots on your patio and catch graywater from a bucket under the bathroom sink to water them…but that’s not really permaculture, and it would be remiss to pretend like it is. You can practice permaculture in the city, and you can do it if you don’t own property. But if you don’t have access to land, on some level, then you have to get out there and find it. By the same token, if you DO own property, and your plans are to create a permaculture design there: unless you create space within your project to include and support those less fortunate than you, then you’re neglecting the third ethic, and probably the first two as well. Caring for the Earth, caring for the people, and considering the needs of others will always require us to reach far beyond our own property and family’s needs.​ Bottom line: If you have it, share it. If you don’t have it, share something else. ​Becky Ellis discusses ways to find space in the city. A note to landowners: If you happen to have access to land, consider opening up a section for nearby urban dwellers to come and grow food. Or, if that’s too much for you, perhaps host local school tours? A case study: In Eugene, Oregon, there’s a -acre organic farm called River’s Turn, and for the last  years, farmer John Sundquist has hosted school buses from all over the county for annual farm tours. The kids come in hordes and follow John around the farm, where he talks about growing food, taking care of animals, managing the water, and so much more. As such, now there are several thousand grown adults, all over the Eugene area and far beyond, who went to River’s Turn farm during their elementary education, and now their kids are going to the farm too! It’s truly extraordinary how that one farmer was able to influence how so many kids think about food, plants, land, and life…simply by opening his doors to the school buses a few days a year. Big picture, little picture….​ Now, there’s a HUGE discussion about privilege, capitalism, and colonization, that we could get into here, and one could posit that controlling a population’s access to land (and water) has been the primary tool of murderous regimes, for millennia. If you want to discuss these topics, you are absolutely welcome to pose them in our group. We just ask that you stay calm, present, and open to the inevitably challenging conversations that will happen. However, for today, focus on your own plans for a permaculture design that works, for you. Come and join the discussion, share your thoughts on the big picture…but don’t get so distracted by it that you neglect the hands-on practicality of applying these ideas to your life, right now.

"Most of the time, when you see the term “permaculture principles” they come packaged in a set of twelve. However, there are so many more ecological design principles, scattered across “permaculture” books but also there are many similar lists in the books and traditions that came long before “permaculture” was a word. We’ve assembled a massive collection of all the other ecological design principles from a variety of sources below. But first, by way of review, let’s circle back to the  P’s of Permaculture: Many of these phrases will sound familiar. Some are proverbs that go back as far as anyone can remember–truths of life that indigenous people used and shared. Others are based on newer explorations of ecology, psychology, and regenerative agriculture, and are representations of a more millennial thought process; one that we will need to continue to cultivate if we are to survive as a species. ​ As you read, each principle, consider it not in terms of whether you agree with or approve of what it says, but more so: imagine how each principle might be used to improve the beauty, efficiency, and/or ecological integrity of your home, garden, or community. And while, yes, you are welcome and encouraged to think critically and present debates and opinions, try to remember that you don’t know what you don’t know, and that nature has more to teach us than we could ever learn in a lifetime. Caveat: this list was compiled by Heather Jo Flores specifically with the history of PERMACULTURE, by that name, in mind. This list is in no way comprehensive, and we very much recognize that pretty much every sentence on the list below could have been heard/used/learned in some indigenous context, at some point, and we acknowledge that we did not do the extensive research it would have required to really track down the sources of this knowledge. We present this timeline for you here so that you can contextualize the “permaculture principles” as typically presented, and so that you can see that these ideas were in no way created or owned by anyone. These, in simple terms, are ecological truths, and we learn them so we can work with, rather than against nature.  Download the following timeline as a PDF The  Inuit Societal Values (traditional, ancient): Rachel Carson, Silent Spring () The Environmental Ethic: Charles Birch and John Cobb, The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community () Six Principles of Natural Systems Bill Mollison, Permaculture: a Designer’s Manual () The Prime Directive of Permaculture: the only ethical decision is to take responsibility for our own existence and that of our children’s. Principle of Cooperation:  cooperation, not competition, is the very basis of future survival and of existing life systems. The Ethical Basis of Permaculture: Rules of Use of Natural Resources: Reduce waste, hence pollution; Thoroughly replace lost minerals; Do a careful energy accounting; and Make a biosocial impact assessment for long term effects on society, and act to buffer or eliminate any negative impacts. Life Intervention Principle:  In chaos lies un­paralleled opportunity for imposing creative order. Law of Return:  Whatever we take, we must return, or Nature demands a return for every gift received, or The user must pay. Directive of Return:  Every object must responsibly provide for its replacement. Society must, as a conditions of use, replace an equal or greater resource than that used. A Policy of Responsibility (to relinquish power): The role of beneficial authority is to return function and responsibility to life and to people; if successful, no further authority is needed. The role of successful design is to create a self-managed system. Categories of Resources: Those which increase by modest use.Those unaffected by use.Those which disappear or degrade if not used.Those reduced by use.Those which pollute or destroy other resources if used. Policy of Resource Management: A responsible human society bans the use of resources which permanently reduce yields of sustainable resources, e.g. pollutants, persistent poisons, radioactives, large areas of concrete and highways, sewers from city to sea. Principle of Disorder: Order and harmony produce energy for other uses. Disorder consumes energy to no useful end. Neatness, tidiness, uniformity, and straightness signify an energy-maintained disorder in natural systems. Law of Entropy (Asimov):  The total energy of the universe is constant and the total entropy is increasing. The Basic Law of Thermodynamics (Watt):  Energy can be transferred from one form to another, but it cannot disappear, or be destroyed, or created. No energy conversion system is ever com­pletely efficient. Principle of Cyclic Opportunity:  Every cyclic event increases the opportunity for yield. To increase cycling is to increase yield. Cycles in nature are diversion routes away from entropic ends-life itself cycles nutrients-giving opportunities for yield, and thus opportunities for species to occupy time niches. Types of Niches: Principle of Stress and Harmony:  Stress may be defined as either prevention of natural function, or of forced function; and (conversely) harmony as the permission of chosen and natural functions and the supply of essential needs. Principle of Stability:  It is not the number of diverse things in a design that leads to stability, it is the number of beneficial connections between these components. Set of Ethics on Natural Systems: Information as a Resource:  Information is the critical potential resource. It becomes a resource only when obtained and acted upon. Practical Design Considerations: The systems we construct should last as long as possible, and take least maintenance.These systems, fueled by the sun, should produce not only their own needs, but the needs of the people creating or controlling them. Thus, they are sustai­nable, as they sustain both themselves and those who construct them. We can use energy to construct these systems, pro­viding that in their lifetime, they store or conserve more energy than we use to construct them or to maintain them. Definition of System Yield: System yield is the sum total of surplus energy produced by, stored, conserved, reused, or converted by the design. Energy is in surplus once the system itself has available all its needs for growth, reproduction, and maintenance. The Role of Life in Yield: Living things, including people, are the only effective intervening systems to capture resources on this planet, and to produce a yield. Thus, it is the sum and capacity of life forms which decide total system yield and surplus. Limits to Yield: Yield is not a fixed sum in any design system. It is the measure of the comprehension, understanding, and ability of the designers and managers of that design. Undistributed Surplus is Pollution: Any system or organism can accept only that quantity of a resource which can be used productively. Any resource input beyond that point throws the system or organism into disorder; oversupply of a resource is a form of chronic pollution.

" “Successful Permaculture earthworks begins with a desire to get the backbone of a design right. Following the design priorities of Water, Access, Structures (Yeoman’s Scale of Permanence), leads one onto the obvious placement for food productivity and leisure systems. The most difficult thing I have to face as a designer and earthworks installer is when I show up at a site and the client has already decided where everything will be going, pointing across the open space, house there, orchard there, chickens over there….Permaculture design is about just the opposite. First, design the water systems in the context of the land form, it then becomes obvious where everything else sits attached to that backbone.”
–Carolyn Gemmel Changing the land to meet our needs is a major part of permaculture. And especially in the beginning, when we are super excited to start changing the landscape, it can be tempting to dig big holes and build random hugelkultures, without being % clear about what happens next. The primary purpose of earthworks is to keep water as high and as long in distance and time in the landscape as possible. Developing an awareness of how water responds to changes in the landscape, on any scale, from micro to macro, will help you understand how water infiltrates and travels through your earthworks project areas. In high rainfall areas you may want to slow and divert the flow of water, whereas in drier climates storing and infusing your land with water may be the priority. Ultimately, the aim is to enhance or create the conditions needed so that plants we want to grow and animals we want to keep can flourish. Due to the changing climate, and the increasing frequency of unstable and unusual weather patterns, it is good to understand the thinking behind different approaches and techniques, and to be aware of how and why people in different climates approach this topic. This, together with close observation of the landscape or cityscape around you, will mean that you are able to respond intelligently when unexpected weather affects your area. In this article, we dive into an exploration of the principle of cyclic opportunity, and earthworks are one of the best ways to utilize that principle. For today, we’ll explore some of the most common types of earthworks, and identify which problems they might solve (or create!) As with many new skills, one of the best ways to get your foot in the door with this body of knowledge is by becoming acquainted with the names of things. What follows is a list of the different types of earthworks commonly used in permaculture design, linked to useful articles on those techniques. The articles listed in this section were all written by members of the PWG faculty, and we’ve also linked additional resources at the bottom of this page. by Kelda Lorax Working with contour/slope is like seeing the naked shape of the land and appreciating it, rather than ignoring, or worse, misusing it. When we ignore the contours of the site:Gardens and other soil disturbances might be placed in ways that increase erosion and damage to the site. We might place components of design in the wrong place, with decreased efficiencyWe might cause ourselves unnecessary work. Read the full article… by Amy Stross A swale is an earthwork technique that takes advantage of the land’s contour to encourage infiltration and increase the soil’s storage capacity. For this reason, swales can be an important tool for passive irrigation, as well as reducing erosion and stormwater runoff. Swales not only catch water, but also soil, seeds, and organic matter, keeping them onsite rather than washing them away. Swales work best on land that is gently to moderately sloped, but they can also be useful on flat land, as even flat land must drain somewhere.​ Read the full article… by Diana Sette Imagine the forest floor of an old growth forest. Layers of humus, maybe little slopes from tree roots, or moss covered, decomposing fallen logs, cover the landscape. Herbaceous plants unfurl in the crevices and atop mounds. Self mulched surfaces produce rich, organic matter from which mushrooms and shrubs spring. Decaying leaves are food for worms, insects, and other arthropods. There is no need for a hose to water, and if it downpours there, it is unlikely to flood, as the carbon-rich soils have significant layers of organic matter, and have an extensive water holding capacity. Download full instructions Terraces are an excellent way to harness the potential of a sloped garden and make it much easier to maintain.  Humans have been building terraced gardens since the dawn of agriculture.

What reasons can you think of for using earthworks in your own garden? A few words of warning! No matter what, your earthworks designs should always be site specific. Some earthwork strategies will be to retain water and help it infiltrate back into the soil and aquifer, and some strategies will be dealing with excessive water that needs to be moved into other locations on the site. Planning a series of terraces on a sunny slope can be a great use of space, but can be disastrous if erosion concerns are not addressed first and water flow down the hill is not considered. By the same token, a misapplied hugelkultur bed can lead to a festering, anaerobic overgrowth of bacteria in which nothing else grows. The risks of doing permanent damage to your site with ill-conceived earthworks cannot be overstated. Keep this admonition in mind as you work to redirect water and resources around your site.  Consider these to be strict guidelines for earthworks in a permaculture design, and do not do any sort of major earthmoving (or even basic shovel work) when any of the following conditions apply:  Here’s a fun video demonstrating the keylines and swales project at Hawk’s Journey farm: Want to learn more about this and other topics related to permaculture, sustainability, and whole-systems design?

Here’s an excellent article with tons of great examples of how keyline design can be used to improve big pieces of land. Turn your lawn into berms that create contour on an otherwise flat site. You don’t have to have swales to make use of berms, and sod, ripped out, turned over and piled up, does the trick.

"“Seeds have the power to preserve species, to enhance cultural as well as genetic diversity, to counter economic monopoly and to check the advance of conformity on all its many fronts.”
― Michael Pollan  There is so much to learn about this topic. We could spend our whole lives focused on this–it’s that much fun, and that much worth doing. This article will give you some teasers about seed saving in a few areas, with information from some of the most qualified people in our community. We’ll touch on plant breeding for organic agriculture, how to save your own garden seeds, and why seeds are at the center of whether or not we will be able to create a sustainable human culture over the long-term. But we’ll barely scratch the surface. If you love plants, and you love having tons of fun outside learning new things, then you might as well carve out a significant portion of the rest of your life for this fascinating, rewarding, and absolutely crucial practice!  A great place to start is with the Seed Stewardship chapter of Food Not Lawns, How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community, which covers all the basics of seed saving and why it matters. Read it here Here’s the incomparable Winona LaDuke, discussing the importance of renewing our relationship with the seeds: When you become an organic seed saver, you find yourself in the company of some of the most delightfully eccentric and passionately committed farmers in the world. Here’s one of the greatest, pioneer and maestro Frank Morton, who very likely bred one of the lettuce strains you’re growing right now, talks about the importance of organic seed breeding: Seed saving is a skill that takes time and practice, and it´s well worth a concerted, extended effort. Download this guide and study it. This video will give you a nice start as well: There is much debate around this topic, with hybrid seed oft vilified in the organic community. However, each has its benefits and it’s important to learn about the big picture. This is a complex topic with centuries of history, so don’t rush to any opinions! That being said, growing heirloom seed–and even better–breeding varieties that work perfectly in your particular bioregion–can be one of the most rewarding and meaningful activities of your lifetime.

"This chapter of Food Not Lawns outlines the whys and hows of a functional group process, in general, and in this article, we get into a bit more detail about conflict resolution and egalitarian process for organizing larger groups and ongoing projects. Also, here’s an excellent article about How to Form a Permaculture Group in your local area. The rest of this article will focus on a project management system that can be used for implementing projects of any size, and was created to go hand-in-hand with the GOBRADIME design process, which we have been using, loosely, during this course and will revisit again, with feeling, next month. What are the biggest obstacles between what we want to do with our permaculture projects, and what we actually DO? Almost always: time and money, right? And also: lack of a clear and functional group process. Because, when you have help with a project, the group can quickly become so much greater than the sum of its parts, and suddenly this time and money obstacles don’t seem so huge. A happy and productive working group can, indeed, be one of the most rewarding experiences in our lives! However, whether a working group is a blessing or a bane has everything to do with how that group is organized. For me, as an introvert and a pragmatist with a heavy dose of ADHD, I have little patience for talking, sitting meetings and tend to prefer an action-oriented, task-based working process that plays to the strengths of the group members and leaves plenty of space for autonomous creativity. And, since the traditional, talk-meeting-based processes I learned during my early years in activism and permaculture were not happy places for me to work, I invented the PEAR Process. or, “how to implement creative, collective projects without having to sit through a bunch of meetings.” What is synergy? Synergy is the interaction of elements and/or organisms that, when combined, produce a total effect that is greater than the sum of the individuals.  A garden is the perfect example. In a healthy garden, all of the organisms interact together, and they each have a role. Do the earthworms produce fruit? No they do not–that’s the tangerine’s job! The worms do wormy stuff, and the trees…well…you get it. Synergy is biorhythm; niches in motion, together, changing and creating abundance. PEAR is a synergistic process which allows us to be greater than the sum of our parts, while still emphasizing the action, autonomy, and accountability that is so important to our overarching ethics as permaculture designers. We can’t control anybody but ourselves, but if we want to change the world, we can’t do it alone. We have to play well with others, and it helps if we learn how to create space so that they may play well with us, and with each other. But, as you remember, chaos/order is also one of those patterns, and human working groups seem to be especially inclined towards getting caught on either the chaotic end of things, or painfully obsessed with order. Either way, a dysfunctional working group will poison even the most brilliant of projects, and a balanced, synergistic group can work miracles. The PEAR process will help you opt for the latter. Yay miracles! Here’s how it works: ​Here’s a quick-reference cheat sheet and a rundown of the process.  Before you begin, have your S.M.A.R.T.E.R. goals in hand. PLACEMENT. Start with your components map. What goes where? What needs to move? Walk through your site zone by zone, focused on placement, and generate your task list. Use the tools above to help you reach this point, or just start from scratch, right now. EVENTS. Starting with your brainstormed list of tasks, and expanding to the rest of what you know about the project, and identify important holidays, due dates, and milestones, and mark them on a timelines. Focus on measurable achievements and tangible deadlines. ACTION. Design from patterns to details. Break the milestones into smaller sets of tasks, and add them to the timeline. Determine which tasks need to go before other tasks, and which tasks are best left until later. Take your time with this process, and work through each major milestone until you have your master timeline roughed out. RELATIONSHIPS. Establish a flow of communication, and delegate. Assign roles, choose tasks, and figure out who is going to do what, and when. Adjust due dates accordingly, as you discover what’s realistic for whomever is actually going to do the work. If you’re doing it all yourself, be kind! Remember that the R is also Rewards. Treat yourself and treat your workers like the treasures you all are. PRO-TIP: Don’t set unrealistic deadlines and then freak yourself out over them. Root down into the whole-system process and make a clear, achievable plan. You have until the end of the world to get it all done! Enjoy the process. This the best work in the world!

Observations are always better applied when we have at least a rudimentary understanding of what you’re looking at! And when we’re designing our permaculture paradise, it is essential that we learn about our local ecosystem. In our certification course, we have a large module devoted to learning about local ecosystems, and it still isn’t enough. However, since this course is supposed to be bite-sized, and also since we have students from all around the world, the best thing for us to do here is to show you how to learn about your own local ecosystem. If this is a new concept to you, or even if you think you know what ecosystems are, take a minute to read the Wikipedia article on the topic–it’s actually a solid overview, and will set the stage for the rest of this article. Also, here’s a lovely introduction from the Khan Academy, to how energy flows and matters are cycled through ecosystems. ​Rosemary Morrow’s book, Earth User’s Guide to Permaculture, is an essential for every permaculture bookshelf. But also, even if you don’t feel prepared to teach permaculture yet, her Earth User’s Guide to Teaching Permaculture is a powerful tool for learning, either alone or in a peer group. If you’ve got a book budget, get yourself a copy of each of these texts, asap.​​ And for now, use this excerpt to teach yourself (and the stakeholders in your design) about local ecosystems. If you do the hands-on assignment at the end of this What is Permaculture article, you’ll spend time observing a tree near your house, and looking for all of the relationships that tree has with its surroundings. This sort of exercise is something you can use, again and again, on every layer of your design. Indeed, observation, while presented as the second step in our GOBRADIME design process, is truly the first step in every action you will ever take as a designer. Look before you leap, right? Yes, always. This beautifully-written piece by Benjamin Weiss takes a naturalist’s approach to observation, within a permaculture context, and will give you lots of different things to “look” for. Over the next several weeks, set aside a few minutes each day to cultivate your observation skills. If you have a site for your permaculture project, spend time observing every nook and cranny, making notes and taking notice of where systems connect, intersect, and collide. If you don’t have a site, spend time observing your neighborhood, exploring your larger community, and looking for options and opportunities you hadn’t noticed.  The very best way to become adept at making designs that work ideally in your local ecosystem is to find a local mentor who can guide you toward the specific resources you need. Do you have a local agricultural extension service? That’s a great place to start. Master Gardener program? Good too. Local permaculture people with long-term sites in their care? Elderly organic farmers, well-educated policy makers, and/or deeply committed stewards and scientists? Ideal. Find the people in your community who are learning, doing, and embodying this work, and connect with them. Help them with their projects. Be generous. And listen.

"Lammas is a celebration of the summer and the gathering in of the grain harvest. This was especially significant in the past. After all the hard work of getting the grain crop cut, threshed, stored and stacked, there came a time for feasting, celebration and assessment. Lammas is a Saxon name meaning ‘Loaf-mass’. Lughnasadh (pronounced Loo-nas-ah) is Irish Gaelic. On Lammas Eve fires were lit on Lammas mounds such as Silbury Hill at Avebury, to honour the Corn Mother as she gives birth to her harvest child, the Grain. This is the seed that will bring next year’s harvest as well as the grain that will sustain life throughout the winter. The month of August was the month of the Grain Mother. An ‘augur’ is an old word for seer and meant ‘increaser’. The great abundance of the Earth Mother is reflected in the titles she was given at this time: The Grain Mother, Barley Mother, Corn Mother, Demeter, Ceres, Cerealia, Grain, the Wise One of the Earth, the Increaser, She who is the seed, who is the womb, who is the soil, the Great Provider, the Preserver of Life. Cutting the ‘corn’ seems to be a general term for all cereal crops, whether they are wheat, barley, rye or oats. There were many customs and rituals throughout Europe to honour the first and the last sheaf of corn to be cut. The last sheaf was often cut by the youngest girl present and fashioned into a Corn Maiden. It was carried joyfully back to the village, sometimes plaited and decked with ribbons, and usually hung over the fireplace. Sometimes it was dressed in women’s clothes, and ritually burnt on the Lammas Fire. Sometimes these Corn Maidens were kept until Yule when they were divided up amongst the cattle or kept until the spring. Sometimes they were kept with the date tied to them. Many Corn Maidens would be seen hanging above the fireplace. In Scotland the ‘young maid’ was made out of the last stalks cut, and kept. The ‘old wife’ was made out of the first stalks cut and was passed on to the nearest farm that had not finished bringing in the corn. This was then passed round until it ended up at the last farm to be cut. Another old European custom was to weave the last sheaf into a large Corn Mother with a smaller corn doll inside it, representing next year’s unborn harvest. The regenerative power of the Earth is never more manifest than now as the grain harvest is gathered in and the Sun’s cycle begins to wane. The Cauldron of Regeneration was central to Celtic spiritual understanding. We are renewed by sleep and darkness, through many deaths and rebirths, and by the sacrifice of our outer lives for the inner journey. Here at Lammas, the doorway to the inner realms is opening. This is the symbolism behind the Demeter/Kore/Persephone story. Demeter, the Corn Mother, represents the ripe corn of this year’s harvest, and Kore or Persephone represents the grain-seed who lives in the dark throughout the winter and reappears in the Spring. Persephone’s descent into the Underworld is a mythical interpretation of the seed lying in the ground during the dark winter months, and her reappearance as the young maid, or the new sprouting seed, in the spring. This story shows us the Triple Goddess in all her aspects: as Earth Mother, the abundant provider; as the Crone, the wisdom found within; and as the Maiden who returns renewed in the spring. Pluto/Hades’ abduction of Persephone is a later reworking of this older myth. After all the manifest energy and activity of the early summer, it is good to make time now to rest and to assimilate all that has happened during the Sun’s active phase. Lammas celebrations would probably have begun with the cutting of the last sheaf of corn. Although the 2nd of August is the calendar date for Lammas, the great Lammas fairs and feasts would probably have lasted from mid July to mid August and would have peaked around the time of the harvest Full Moon. Once the grain had been safely gathered in and the men returned from their hunting trips, it was a time for feasting, dancing and merry-making, a great celebration of the first of the harvest and assessment of the year’s achievements. Beer, wine, cider and whisky made from the previous year’s harvest, were ritually drunk, celebrating the transformative power of Fire and Water. Cooking fires were honoured as they too embodied the power of Fire and Water. Bread was made from the new grain and thanks were given to the Sun’s life energy reborn as the bread of life. This is a busy time for harvesting herbs and collecting herb seeds to sow in the spring. Give thanks and blessings as you pick them, dry them and store them. Review what you know about them and ways you can use them both physically and metaphysically. Harvest sage at the end of July, before the flowers have come out. Sage is a herb associated with wisdom and releasing blocks in expression. It is connected to the throat chakra and is for those who have something to say but cannot let it out. It will help you express your emotions. Make the herb tea in the usual way. The infusion is a useful antiseptic herb for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers and mouth infections. It can be used as a gargle, for bathing wounds, sores, and to stop bleeding. Use the tea infusion externally and then drink afterwards as well. It will dry up excess secretions such as catarrh or sinusitis. It contains oestrogen and is useful in the menopause and for delayed menstruation. Burn dried sage to cleanse and purify. Waft the smoke around a person to cleanse their aura (called smudging). This is a good way to begin any ritual or ceremony. N.B. It must not be taken if pregnant, and because of its drying action, it must not be taken for long periods of time. It will dry up mother’s milk. Care must be taken by those who are insulin-dependent, and to be avoided by epileptics. Garlands of meadowsweet were traditionally worn for the Lammas celebrations. Its heady perfume expands the psyche, and builds inner strength. It enhances flexibility and connection to the inner levels. It is a mild sedative and painkiller containing salicylic acid (aspirin) that affects the rate at which blood clots. It is a good digestive tonic that reduces excess acidity and is useful for heartburn, hyperacidity, gastritis and peptic ulcers. As it cleanses the body of harmful acids, it is useful for any inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is a strong diuretic (increases urine) and can be used for any bladder or kidney complaint including cystitis. It reduces stagnation in the liver and therefore will help the immune system function more effectively. Its harvest time is July and August when the flowers are just beginning to open. Collect them in brown paper bags to dry for later use. N.B. Avoid if on anti-coagulant drugs. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Sacred Earth Celebrations, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"There are various methods for drying herbs for herbal recipes but they all require that the herb is dried and stored out of the light. I prefer to use brown paper bags, other people hang them up in bunches or lay them between sheets of newspaper or brown paper. • If using brown paper bags always label the bags with the name of the herb, the date and where you picked it. This is good practice and a good habit to get into as plants can change a lot in the drying process. Even if you think you will know what it is, it is surprising how you can forget, especially if you bag up several herbs over a period of a few weeks. • Leave the bags in a dry warm environment for several weeks. Put them in the airing cupboard if you have one, hang over the wood-burner or leave them on top of radiators. Shake the bags and turn the leaves over with your hands every day or two. It is essential to do this to stop any mould getting in to the herbs while they are still drying. • The herbal properties of leaves and flowers will deteriorate after 1 year so they need to be re-collected every year. Fruit, seeds, berries, roots and bark will last for 2 years. It is light that destroys the herbal properties of herbs, so at its simplest herbs can be stored all year in brown paper bags, although if they are kept in the kitchen they will need to be kept in a plastic container or airtight tin to keep them dry. Keeping the herbs in a dedicated leather or cotton bag is the traditional medicine way and these are hung somewhere warm and dry, near a radiator or fire. Putting them into dark glass jars is good in a kitchen because of the condensation. Clear jam jars are fine if they are kept in a dark cupboard. At its simplest the jar can be kept in a brown paper bag or more creative ways can be found. Herb teas vary in taste and quality. Buying popular blends as tea bags is convenient, but be aware that the herbs may be old by the time you drink them, and the herbs may have been grown in monocultures and sprayed with petrochemicals. It is infinitely better to make your own. • Making herb teas is not an exact science, especially when using the common safe plants. Interestingly, different herbalists use different amounts. I use about a teaspoonful of dried herbs or a small pile that fits into the hollow of my palm, and between a half to a pint of water, depending on the need. Use less for young children and anyone who is weak and frail. Dried herbs have twice the strength of fresh herbs, so twice the amount of fresh herb is used. • As you make the tea, say thank you to the plant. This open-hearted attitude adds to the healing process. I like to picture the plant and affirm its healing qualities as I wait for the tea to brew, partly to affirm the healing I am engaged in and also as a memory aid. This way I keep learning and understanding more about the plants all the time and keep my knowledge strong. Many of the herbs are an acquired taste. Nurture an openness to these wild flavours and earthy tastes and give them a chance. More often than not, a taste you didn’t like at first becomes a taste that you find you love. These are also for adults only as they are a mixture of brandy and honey. This makes them a most delicious way to take your medicine! They are especially good to use when travelling as they are kept in small dropper bottles and taken neat. Elixirs are combination remedies, created for specific uses and personal needs. Elixirs need to taste good so the addition of any aromatic herbs improves the flavour, but must also support the over-all herbal action. They are experimental and fun, as well as being extremely effective and I like to give them creative names. Write up everything in your Herb Journal. This is especially important when you make combination elixirs. Recording the plants and proportions used is invaluable when you create something you want to repeat. Method one 1. Half fill a dark jar with a herb or combinations of herbs: tear the leaves, crush the seeds or fruit, and chop the roots. Send your thanks to the plants. Add a little of something that will give it a nice flavour such as rose petals, sweet violet, lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena etc, making sure that their actions support the overall use of the remedy. 2. Cover the plant matter with clear runny honey and send your silent thanks to the bees. Poke well with a chopstick to get out any trapped air bubbles and break the plant matter up further. 3. Then top the jar up with brandy and 4. Put on the lid and label, date and shake well. Give it a poke and a shake frequently and keep out of bright light. They are ready in about a month, although they come to no harm if they are left longer. 5. Strain off the plant matter and rebottle in clean dark dropper bottles. Pour a little boiling water over the mash of herbs that are left over, getting every last bit of goodness out of them. Toast the plant and its medicine and have your first taste before returning the spent mash to the earth with thanks. Method two Create an instant elixir using the tinctures you have made. 1. Using a jug combine several tinctures that support the remedy you are making. 2. Mix in a similar amount of honey to tincture and mix the two together. 3. Pour into dark dropper bottles. Name and date and write up in your herb journal. Their dosage is similar to tinctures, although I tend to use them little and often. Here are some suggestions of plants to choose from, depending on what you have available. I have listed the native plants first and the aromatics at the end. Anti-stress elixir Hawthorn, cowslip, vervain, rose petals, lavender, borage.

"Growing my own mulch has long been a goal of mine. We use a lot of mulch in the nursery and garden and at the moment I have no problem sourcing straw but if/when the day comes that the farmers start using their own straw to improve their soil (which is becoming a more common practice), I’ll be needing to step up my mulch growing efforts. Currently, I grow enough mulch to sustain my perennial beds and around 10% of my annual beds but rely on imported straw for mulching the other 90% of annual vegetable and nursery beds. My ideal mulch plant grows fast, is drought tolerant, competes minimally with crop plants, does not contain seed that easily spreads, is easy to handle and cut, i.e. not thorny/prickly or tough and fibrous, and can biodegrade relatively quickly (thereby returning the nutrients back to soil). I’ve broadly categorized the main sources of mulch we produce in our 1500m2 garden. Aquatic plants
I grow emergent wetland species such us cattails (Typha spp), sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) on the banks of a small pond (6m x 3m), and within a grey water reed bed (1m x 6m). The pond also provides suitable habitat for hornworts (Ceratophyllum spp). a submerged rootless perennial that gathers on the surface en masse. This plant makes an excellent mulch being rich in nitrogen, growing very fast and is easy to position around the base of plants. The emergent species provide a good thick carbon rich mulch that helps to reduce evaporation on the terrestrial beds and I cut these back in the spring in case they are used for overwintering invertebrates. Aquatic plants are an excellent source of mulch as there are no issues with seed germinating amongst your land based crops. Tap rooted perennial / biennials
Deep rooted perennial plants tend to produce a good amount of biomass, are generally drought tolerant and do not compete strongly with our crop plants. I have found native biennial weeds such as greater burdock (Arctium lappa), a very useful mulch plant with the gigantic leaves growing back very fast after a cut. Lesser burdock (Arctium minus), is also useful albeit to lesser extent. Although biennial, if you cut back these plants before flowering you can prolong their life, harvesting good quantities of seed free biomass. I do eventually allow some of the plants to flower and they are much loved by bees among other insects. Comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum), ‘bocking 14’, is a classic example of a deep rooted mulch plant. We have the plant scattered throughout the garden and planted in dedicated patches. The plants do require irrigation however and will only provide good leaf yields if grown on fertile soil. Peeing on the plants is recommended. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), provide a great source of biomass. For a good tuber harvest it’s best to wait until the end of the season before harvesting the mulch. We can never consume as much as we produce of these tubers in the kitchen. I have found them to be much appreciated by our pigs and an excellent source of fresh winter food for our rabbits. Leaves of greater burdock (Arctium lappa) Nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs 
These plants take a while to establish but make an excellent contribution. I’ve had good results from coppicing empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), when they are 3-years-old and chop and dropping the soft new growth three or four times a year. I am expecting to also see good results from grey alder (Alnus incana) and Italian alder (Alnus cordata). I avoid using thorny nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs for this purpose. Annual trimming of shrubs such as autumn olive – Elaeagnus umbellata and broom – Cytisus scoparius also provides good quantities of mulch. Click here for more info on nitrogen fixing plants. Lawn and ground cover
One of my favourite sources of mulch is lawn trimmings. They are great for mulching potted plants or applying a mulch into tight spots. Mixed species lawns will contain a more diverse mix of mineral nutrients. Lawns including a legume such as white clover (Trifolim repens), can provide a nitrogen rich mulch. It’s a good idea to leave some of the trimmings behind to keep the lawn healthy. Autumn leaf fall and herbaceous stem residue
The annual shedding of leaves from trees and shrubs in our garden make a great contribution to our mulch capital. Leaves can be cleared from paths, lawns and wildflower beds (as they will disrupt the growth in these areas) and concentrated where they are of benefit such as the base of high demanding fruiting shrubs such as blackcurrants or blackberries. Herbaceous perennials such as lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis) and mints (Mentha spp). will provide dead stems annually. It’s always a good idea to leave hollow stems of some herbaceous perennials to remain for the winter as they are utilized by invertebrates for egg laying and hibernating. If the plant does not have a hollow stem it can be cut back and used for mulch. Fennel (Foeniculm vulgare), provides large quantities of biomass and as far as I can tell the stems are not utilised by any organism over the winter. In the vegetable garden all the remnants of my crops after harvesting go straight back to the surface for recycling. Foeniculum vulgare and other herbaceous perennials Tree prunings
Woody prunings from shrubs, trees and vines cut into small pieces (5-10cm) make good mulch in the mature areas of the forest garden with well established fungal soils specializing in breaking down the lignified woody material. Living mulches 
In the more mature areas of the garden where the trees have established (5yrs and older) I have dispensed with mulch all together in favour of ground cover plants that can be considered living mulches. Some the most successful perennial living mulches I have found that form good dense cover in the shade include bugle (Ajuga reptans), spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), Caucasian stonecrop (Sedem spurium), perwinkle (Vinca major) and betony (Stachys officinalis). Lamium maculatum spreading well under a mullbery (Morus alba) Scaling up mulch production
In order to grow enough mulch to provide a water retaining, weed excluding barrier for my annual and nursery beds I would certainly need more space. A larger wetland area would be ideal, with aquatic species growing very fast and the seed bearing parts of the plants being non problematic to use on terrestrial beds. If you don’t have a reliable aquatic habitat, the next best option for growing quantities of mulch without irrigation and fertilization is probably grass. During my next post I’ll be sharing a plan where using the lessons garnered from small scale systems, we’ll be growing mulch to support approx 670 fruit trees and 1360 soft fruit shrubs on a 5ha Agroforestry Project (design layout below).

"There are many medicinal uses for elder – Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae family). It is an evocative tree, steeped in history, tradition, and folklore. This is one of our great food and medicinal plants, easily found in most areas of the British Isles where people have settled. It’s botanical name, Sambucus nigra, stems from the Greek word sambuke; a ‘musical pipe’, due to its hollow form supplying our ancestors a perfect wood for making pipes. The Latin ‘nigra’, means black, in allusion to the dark colour of ripe elder berry fruit. Elder is a deciduous woodland and hedgerow plant, native to Northern Europe and North America, and can be seen happily growing on most types of soil up to altitudes of approximately 470m. Superstition says to not cut elder down or burn them. This may be purely because of the toxic fumes which rise from burning elder wood, or it may be that the faeries will be really upset because you are destroying such a useful plant! Other legends have grown around this plant, such as that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who allegedly betrayed Jesus to the Romans, then said to have hanged himself from its branches. This story gave rise to the name of the edible fungus found all year round on the elder – the Jelly Ear. Elder can sometimes be found growing as a shrubby form, and sometimes like a tree on a single trunk, similar to other woodland-edge plants like hazel, hawthorn and blackthorn. A mature elder typically displays a domed crown, and will be spotted from a distance once you know it. Elders can reach 8m or more, although more commonly 5-6m or so, because of other limiting environmental factors. Ideally the plant likes a rich and damp soil in a sunny position. Elder does not like exposed sites or windy hillsides. The branches display numerous lenticels (air holes) and produce their stems with opposite pairs of buds. The buds are naked, without bud scales. The light brown, corky bark pattern on elder can appear quite similar to the invasive exotic, the ‘butterfly bush’ – Buddleja davidii. The similarity between Sambucus and Buddleja ends there. Elder’s leaves are completely different in form. They are compound, comprising of seven oval, serrated leaflets, each being about 7-10cm long. The leaflets typically come in two or three opposite pairs with one terminal leaflet. They are a much lighter green colour than the Himalayan native ‘butterfly bush’ which has a simple, lanceolate / elliptical leaf. You will find this year’s flowers and fruits on last year’s growth. The umbel-like elderflowers, (technically corymbs), are borne on terminal stems. Five creamy-white petals surround the yellow anthers. When ripe, and picked on a sunny day, are bursting with pollen and scent, and should be a bright lemon-yellow. They turn brown when past their best. Only pick ripe flowers! The flowers have a small amount of natural yeast on them which assists fermentation when making drinks. This will be testified by anyone who makes the superb thirst quenching elderflower champagne! The rank smell of elder leaves or the gone-over flowers is known to repel many who come across it, often being described as a cat urine smell!  After a short but sweet period in full bloom, the flowers give rise to upstanding clusters of small berries, which are typically no bigger than 10mm in diameter. Initially green, the berries gradually begin to nod earthwards as they ripen. At the end of the summer they are dark purple – with many medicinal uses. Parts used Flowers, berries, leaves, bark, fungi. Harvest time The flowers are picked when in full bloom. The berries are picked when ripe in the autumn. Key active medicinal constituents Tannins, potassium, mucilage, phenols, triterpenes, sterols, lectins, flavonoids (including rutin). The dark coloured berries are rich in anthocyanins, folic acid and vitamins A and C. They also contain flavonoids, and cyanidin glucosides, which are poisonous in large doses.  Medicinal actions Diaphoretic, febrifuge, anti-catarrhal, anti viral, immuno-supportive. Uses – Elderflowers and berries are expectorant and diaphoretic, thus they help to manage and reduce fevers and to rid the body of toxins. – Elderflowers are also anti-viral and are useful in combating herpes simplex type 1 virus (responsible for cold sores). – The flowers can be made into champagne, cordials, wine, sorbet, jam and fritters. – Elderberry extract has been proven to inhibit various strains of flu, especially if taken early enough. Many people can testify that elder can significantly reduce recovery times from influenza. – Some books have stated the ripe berries are poisonous, but this is slightly misleading. They will cause gastric upset if you eat a large quantity raw, (as will too many apples while scrumping) but in small amounts they should present no problem. Cooked into jams, syrups etc., larger quantities of elderberries are absolutely fine. – Pioneering contemporary forager-chefs have rediscovered that even the green berries can be used, as ‘capers’, if prepared correctly. This involves fermenting the berries in a salt brine solution for a few days, similar to preparing green walnuts for pickling, and then covering in a flavoured vinegar. – Even when the tree is dormant in the winter, it is still possible to harvest food! The ‘Jelly ear’ fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is often found on elder, dead or alive. Known as a delicacy in China, it is best cooked sliced into thin strips, in a spicy, oriental-style soup.

"There’s a plethora of info out there about comfrey but not much detail regarding establishing and managing a comfrey patch so I thought I would write an article to share my experience on this and how we grow comfrey as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden. A member of the borage family, comfrey – Symphytum spp. is native to Europe and Asia and there are 40 recorded species throughout that region. The plant most commonly referred to and used in gardens is Russian comfrey – Symphytum x uplandicum, a naturally occurring hybrid of two wild species: common comfrey – Symphytum officinale and prickly comfrey – Symphytum asperum. A few centuries back, the hybrid Symphytum x uplandicum came to the attention of Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) and he widely promoted the plant as a food and forage crop. Years later, and after two world wars, Lawrence D Hills (1911-1991) would continue Henry Doubleday’s Comfrey crusade. In the 1950s, Hills developed a comfrey research program in the village of Bocking, near Braintree in the UK. The original trial site is on the plot of land now occupied by the Doubleday Gardens housing development. Lawrence Hills lived at 20 Convent Lane just around the corner of the trial site. At this site, Hills trialed at least 21 comfrey ‘strains’, each one named after the village Bocking. Strain 14 was identified as being the most nutrient rich, non-seeding strain and ‘Bocking 14’ began its journey into gardens far and wide across the world. (Learn more its history on the Balkan Ecology Project blog.) Medicinal – Comfrey has been cultivated as a healing herb since at least 400BC. The Greeks and Romans commonly used comfrey to stop heavy bleeding, treat bronchial problems and heal wounds and broken bones. Poultices were made for external wounds and tea was consumed for internal ailments. Comfrey has been reported to promote healthy skin with its mucilage content that moisturizes and soothes and promotes cell proliferation. This plant is my first port of call if ever I need to dress a wound. Simply take a few leaves brush them together to remove the hairs and wrap them around the wound and apply light pressure. It’s incredibly effective at stopping the bleeding, reducing the pain and healing the wound. Biomas – Comfrey produces large amounts of foliage from late May (late spring) until hard frosts in October or November (late autumn). The plant is excellent for producing mulch and can be cut from 2-5 times per year depending on how well the plants are watered and fed. The plant grows rapidly after each harvest. In our gardens we have Comfrey ‘Bocking 14’ located next to each fruit tree in order to have a renewable source of mulch just where we need it. We also grow in patches as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden and have patches in the wildflower meadows (details below). We’ve supplied 1,000 ‘Bocking 14’ cuttings to Oxygenisis, a business in Germany who are experimenting with using this plant for carbon capture. Mineral dam – Comfrey has deep roots of up to 2m that utilize nutrients deep in the subsoil that would otherwise wash away with the underground soil water or remain inaccessible to other plants. The nutrients, once taken up from the roots, are relocated throughout the plant as and where needed with some of them ending up in the comfrey leaf mass. When cutting the leaf mass and applying to the soil surface, the mined nutrients are returned and again made accessible to shallower rooted crop plants.  Biodiversity – The bell shaped flowers provide nectar and pollen to many species of bees and other insects from late May until the first frosts in late autumn. Lacewings are said to lay eggs on comfrey and spiders overwinter on the plant. Parasitoid wasps and spiders will hunt on and around comfrey. Pest and disease prevention and control – Research indicates that a comfrey solution can be used to prevent powdery mildew. Pest predators such as spiders, lacewings and parasatoid wasps associate with this plant. It’s best to leave some plants alone in order to sustain pest predator relationships. Ground cover – Some species can quickly spread to form a thick ground cover and work particularly well for ground cover on the sunny side under shrubs and trees. Symphytum tuberosum – Tuberous Comfrey seems to be the best species for this.  Fertilizer – Comfrey leaves contain a great balance of major plant nutrients (N,P,K) and can be fed to plants as powder, direct mulch or by steeping chopped comfrey leaves in water for several weeks to produce a thick, dark liquid that can be diluted with water and applied to plant roots. More on this below. Nutritional value of comfrey – You can see from the below table that wilted comfrey contains significantly higher quantities of potash compared to other organic fertilizers. It’s well recorded that comfrey is an excellent source of potassium (K) a major plant nutrient that is required by plants in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction. Animal fodder – Comfrey has a long history for use as an animal feed. Lawrence D Hills dedicated books to this topic.* The leaves are best received by animals wilted. Fresh leaves can be eaten by pigs, sheep, and poultry but cattle, rabbits and horses will only consume wilted leaves. Human consumption – Symphytum officianale and Symphytum x uplandicum are both reported to be used for salad and potherb and are best when cooked. Personally I’m not keen on the texture but will have the occasional nibble from the garden using the new growth to mix in a spring green salad. Caution – Although comfrey has been used as a food crop, in the past 20 years scientific studies reported that comfrey may be carcinogenic, since it appeared to cause liver damage and cancerous tumors in rats. These reports have temporarily restricted development of comfrey as a food crop. In light of this, the regular consumption of comfrey is not advisable.  Life cycle – Herbaceous perennial Growth habit – Comfrey begins growth in early-April and by early May compact clusters of young leaves are visible in the crown of the old plant. Within a few weeks, the leaf blades with long petioles have grown to over 35cm high. Basal leaves are large, lance-shaped, stalked, and coarsely hairy. The leaves die back following the first frost and remain dormant for winter. Many species can spread vigorously via seed and are generally not welcome in the garden because of this. Other species can spread via tubers and all species quickly regenerate from broken root pieces.  Flowering – Starts in late May or early June and continues until the first frost in late autumn. The bell-shaped flowers with pedicels are in terminal cymes or one-sided clusters. Flowers of common comfrey are usually creamy yellow, but white, red, or purple types have been found in Europe. Prickly comfrey has pink and blue flowers while Russian comfrey has blue, purple, or red-purple flowers. Tuberous comfrey has creamy white flowers. Vegetative growth does not cease with the start of flowering, and the plant will add new stems continuously during the growing season. Most comfrey plants can be somewhat invasive, spreading via seed to parts of the garden where they are not wanted. ‘Bocking 14’ will flower and provide nectar and pollen but will not produce viable seed. Roots – Some species have short, thick, tuberous roots such as Symphytum tuberosum. Others such as Symphytum x uplandicum have deep and expansive root systems. Light – Needs full sun for good biomass production but grows fine in the shade. Shade – Tolerates light shade (about 50%). Moisture – Some species are drought tolerant e.g. Symphytum tuberosum. Cultivated plants require irrigation. USDA Hardiness Zone – 4-9 comfrey crowns and roots are very winter hardy.  Soil – Comfrey is adaptable to many soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils.  pH – Tolerates a wide range (6.5-8.5), although not very sensitive to soil pH, highest yields are reported to occur on soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Perhaps you’re interested in growing comfrey to feed your animals, for medicine, for mulch, for compost or you’re slightly masochistic and want to roll around naked in the pricky beds of biomass (not me). In any case, here’s how to do it. The plant we use in our gardens is Symphytum x uplandicum – ‘Bocking 14’. A sterile cultivar that produces copious quantities of nutrient dense biomass. The following information is based on using this plant.  Choosing the site – We’re growing for biomass and want the plants to receive as much light as possible. Accordingly, we lay out our beds on an east to west axis (we’re in the northern hemisphere).  Irrigation is necessary if you want to get good yields from the plants so picking a place with access to irrigation is of paramount important.  In areas of low rainfall, using the gradient of the land to channel precipitation towards your beds will reduce the water needs of your plants. In areas of high rainfall with a high water table you should consider diverting water away from the beds. Once established, comfrey is difficult to get rid of, so choose a site where you want it to stay. Don’t plant comfrey in any area you cultivate, as the broken root pieces quickly establish into new plants and can out compete slower growing crops.  Position comfrey downhill from where you expect leachate to be present, i.e downhill from a manure pile , compost heap, outside toilet, animal pen etc., can provide passive fertility to the plants and rescue otherwise lost minerals from draining away with the sub soil ground water. 
Grow the comfrey where you want to use it. As you’ll see later we may be harvesting over 1/4 ton biomass from our patch and don’t want to be carrying that over long distances. Preparing the site – Raised beds are a major part of our fertility strategy and overtime retain water and nutrients very efficiently. I use 1.3m wide beds surrounded by 50cm paths for our crops as this allows easy access for harvesting everywhere in the beds without ever having to tread on the soil and the paths are wise enough to take our lawnmower. To form a bed, the area should be cleared of all plants, which is best achieved by sheet mulching the season before. Pernicious perennials or tap rooted biennials should be dug out. After you have cleared the whole area, mark out the bed shape with string and dig out 50cm wide paths around your beds, applying the soil to the surface of the planting area and thereby creating the initial rise of the bed. Fork over the beds well. If a hardpan is present take the time and effort to eliminate it before planting. Depending on the quality of your soil you may want to add extra compost before planting into the bed. If you have sheet mulched the area before hand, with the additional soil from the paths all you need to do is add a good 20cm thick straw mulch (or some other mulch) and it’s ready for planting. A good mulch to start with will help keep the weeds down while your comfrey gets going. You can alter the depth and gradient of the paths to facilitate the required direction of water movement. Planting material – You can plant out with crown divisions or root cuttings best done in the spring when the soil has warmed. A crown division can be obtained from simply putting a spade through the center of a mature comfrey plant and transplanting the divided sections. For our beds, I divided two year old plants into quarters, sometimes sixths, and these established very well in the first year. It’s bests not to harvest the leaf biomass in the first year in order to allow a deep root system to develop. However if you use large divisions you can start harvesting in July. Root cuttings are a great way to plant out large areas of comfrey. The cuttings should be grown on in small pots with 50% compost 50% river sand mix kept moist and planted out in the spring as soon as the first leaves emerge and the soil has warmed. If you are planting large numbers of root cuttings you can plant directly into the beds by creating ‘nests’ in the straw, adding two cupped handfuls of the above mentioned potting mix and plant the cuttings into this. Keep them moist like a wrung out sponge and the success rate will be very close to 100%. Spacing – The plants should be spaced 60cm apart in rows and 60cm apart at diagonals between rows. Plant the rows 15cm from the edge of the beds. Cutting – In the first year allow the plants to establish so that the roots develop well and penetrate deep into the subsoil. Remove any weeds around the plants leaving them on the surface. The following year the cutting can begin. You can scythe the beds for a quick harvest or cut each plant individually with a pair of secateurs or shears cutting to 5cm or so from ground level. The leaves are prickly so if you have sensitive hands wear gloves. Cut the comfrey as the flowering stalks emerge up to four times a year. Allow the plants to flower at least once during the season to provide bee fodder to a range of native bees and honey bees. Leave the last flush of leaves before the winter so that invertebrates can find winter shelter in the undergrowth. You may need to weed between cuts every now and then but generally the comfrey will quickly cover the surface. Feeding – After you have cut the comfrey, mow the pathways between the beds and empty the trimmings to the base of the comfrey plants. Any trimmings from lawns and hedges in the surrounding area can also be used. We are experimenting with growing nitrogen fixing hedging and ground cover plants adjacent to the patch in order to feed our comfrey. A most excellent comfrey feed is undiluted urine applied at a rate of approx 500 ml per plant twice per growing season. Irrigation – Comfrey will produce more biomass if irrigated and in dry climates it’s essential to irrigate. Comfrey plants wilt very fast in hot conditions and will stop photosynthesising at this point. Twenty litres per m2 per week of drought should be more than adequate. The beauty of biological systems are that, if managed properly, each year the soils improve and the ability of the soil to store water will improve over time. We use passive irrigation diverting water from a mountain stream into the paths around the beds. The paths fill with water, we raise the level by blocking the low points with sacks of sawdust and the water is drawn throughout the soil via capillary action. Passive irrigation in our market garden. The paths fill with water and the water permeates throughout the soil via capillary action. As mulch – Freshly cut comfrey leaves make good mulch because they have high nitrogen content, and don’t pull nitrogen from the soil while decomposing. Comfrey’s high potassium content makes it especially beneficial for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, berries, and fruit trees. With adequate feed and watering we’ve seen yields of 2-3kg of biomass per plant per cut. Comfrey beds establishing well. This bed was planted with divided crowns 5 months prior to this photo being taken. Liquid fertliser – What I like to call ‘Comfert’. Fill a barrel, preferably with a bottom tap and a gauze on the inside (to prevent clogging) about 3/4 full with freshly cut comfrey and add water to fill the barrel. Cover it, and let it steep for 3-6 weeks. The smell from the resulting liquid is far from attractive so approach with caution. The tea may be used full strength or diluted by half or more. Don’t apply before heavy rain is forecast as most of the nutrients suspended in the liquid will wash straight through the soil. For the best results apply the feed to your vegetables when they are in most need of the extra fertility. This will be different for each crop, for example, tomatoes are best fed when they are setting fruit and then any time during the fruiting period. Applying comfert before this can be counter productive and make your plants more susceptible to pest problems. The black slurry at the bottom of the barrel can be dispersed evenly back over the comfrey patch. Liquid fertilizer concentrate – ‘Comfert Plus’ can also be made by packing fresh-cut comfrey tops into an old bucket, weighing them down with something heavy, covering tightly, and waiting a few weeks for them to decompose into a black slurry. You can put a hole in the bottom of the bucket and collect the concentrate in another container as it drips out. Dilute this comfrey concentrate about 15 to 1 with water, and use as you would comfert. You can seal this concentrate in plastic jugs until you are ready to use it. Warning! Comfert stinks like hell. My nieces came to visit from London last year and offered to help out in the market garden. One of the tasks that day was to apply comfert to the crops. Let’s just say it did not end well and we had a much better experience taking softwood cuttings the next day. According to Martin Crawford in Creating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops, one cut of comfrey from one plant contains 0.5g of Nitrogen (N) and 10g of potassium (K) to crops. Based on this I calculated how much Potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and biomass the 13 m2 comfrey patch can potentially produce in a year. Below is a table indicating how many comfrey cuts are needed to meet the Nitrogen and Potassium needs of various moderate and heavy cropping fruit and nut trees and annual vegetables. In the 1960s, Lawrence D. Hills used UK gardeners records for a comfrey report. (See the Balkan Ecology Project blog for the results.) Based on these records I calculated a yield of approx. 5.5kg of biomass per plant each year. Using this figure one of our beds should produce approx 286kg of biomass. We shall see as this year we begin our own records. We’re looking to gather some solid data on how comfrey performs in our climate and we’ll be recording the yields from our patch starting this season and for at least the next five years. For more info on our record keeping and research programs see Polyculture Market Garden Study. If you would like to join the ‘who can grow the most comfrey’ experiment and contribute data to our records, send us an email. It will be great to have records from all over the world.

"Hugelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, means hill culture or hill mound. Instead of putting branches, leaves and grass clippings in bags by the curbside for the bin men… build a hugel bed. Simply mound logs, branches, leaves, grass clippings, straw, cardboard, petroleum-free newspaper, manure, compost or whatever other biomass you have available, top with soil and plant your veggies. The advantages of a hugel bed are many, including: The gradual decay of wood is a consistent source of long-term nutrients for the plants. A large bed might give out a constant supply of nutrients for 20 years (or even longer if you use only hardwoods). The composting wood also generates heat which should extend the growing season. Soil aeration increases as those branches and logs break down… meaning the bed will be no till, long term. The logs and branches act like a sponge. Rainwater is stored and then released during drier times. Actually you may never need to water your hugel bed again after the first year (except during long term droughts). Sequester carbon into the soil. On a sod lawn Sepp Holzer (hugelkultur expert) recommends cutting out the sod, digging a one foot deep trench and filling the trench with logs and branches. Then cover the logs with the upside down turf. On top of the turf add grass clippings, seaweed, compost, aged manure, straw, green leaves, mulch, etc…  Sepp Holzer recommends steep hugel beds to avoid compaction from increased pressure over time. Steep beds mean more surface area in your garden for plants and the height makes easy harvesting. The greater the mass, the greater the water-retention benefits. Hugel bed dug in clay with logs put in vertically, next branches and lots of wood chips. Top 6 inches will be wood chips and dirt. This bed will store water and give nutrients for many years to come. Straw bale gardens require less soil, less water and hold heat. As the straw breaks down nutrients feed the plants. Combining a straw surround with a hugel interior, topped by lasagne layering is an excellent idea for an area with poor quality soil. Hugel bed in Ontario, Canada (June 28th) by Tim Burrows. Tim surrounded his very tall hugel bed in pallets! Sheet mulching (lasagne gardening) is like composting in place. Above: just a suggestion as to sheet mulching layers. Nitrogen-rich material such as fresh grass clippings or green leaves put right on the hugelkultur wood would help jump start the composting process. Could also include seaweed, straw, dead leaves, leaf mould, etc.

The first year of break down means the wood (and fungi) steal a lot of the nitrogen out of the surrounding environment, so adding nitrogen during the first year or planting crops that add nitrogen to the soil (like legumes) or planting species with minimal nitrogen requirements is necessary, unless there is plenty of organic material on top of the wood. After the wood absorbs nitrogen to its fill, the wood will start to break down and start to give nitrogen back in the process. In the end you will be left with a beautiful bed of nutrient rich soil. Tree types that work well in hugelkultur:
Hardwoods break down slowly and therefore your hugel bed will last longer, hold water for more years and add nutrients for more years. But softwoods are acceptable as well, a softwood bed will just disintegrate quicker. Mixing woods with softwoods and branches on top, to give off nutrients first, and hardwoods on bottom, sounds like a plan if you have access to multiple types of wood. Yet the newly decomposing softwoods at the top will eat up a lot of nitrogen at first, so compensate for that.

Woods that work best:
Alders, apple, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, oak, poplar, willow (make sure it is dead or it will sprout).

Trees types that work okay:
Black cherry (use only rotted), camphor wood (well aged), cedar/juniper/yew (anti-microbial/anti-fungal, so use only at very bottom or unless already well-aged. Cedar should be broken down before new plant roots reach it), eucalyptus (slightly anti-microbial), osage orange (exceptionally resistant to decay), Pacific yew (exceptionally resistant to decay), pine/fir/spruce (tannins and sap), red mulberry (exceptionally resistant to decay).

Tree types to avoid:
Black locust (will not decompose), black walnut (juglone toxin), old growth redwood (heartwood will not decompose and redwood compost can prevent seed germination).

"Thistles are a bane of picnickers and campers. Who hasn’t trodden on the sharp, unforgiving spines of a thistle when out and about barefoot in grasslands? For many people, relationships with thistles have generally been painful and irritable, but now you can get your own back! One of the great things about thistles is that every single species is edible, so this is great news for foraging beginners! Even the closest lookalikes found here are edible – the sow thistles (Sonchus spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), so when working with the thistles, you can learn to identify and proceed to experiment with complete confidence from the outset. We have at least 14 species of thistle growing wild in the UK, mostly from the Cirsium (aka plume thistles) and Carduus genera. Thistles are found in numerous settings all over our islands and can be a useful soil barometer. Often their presence signifies that the land is fertile, and in many instances, neglected. I eat from a number of different species. These are: creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis), spear thistle (C. vulgare), woolly thistle (C. eriophorum), marsh thistle (C. palustris), and welted thistle (Carduus acanthoides syn C. crispus). As you will discover, plants that have spines to offer protection against predators, have no real need for bitterness. Spear thistle It’s almost impossible to misidentify a thistle. One of the easy-to-spot botanical differences between thistles and their numerous relatives in the daisy family, is that the overlapping bracts (involucre) found directly below the flowers of thistles, are always spiny. Simple! The leaves of the numerous species will differ in size, shape and the density of spine coverage. Most have stiff spines on the margins, but some have soft prickles. You need to discover for yourself which are the more tactile! When in flower, most thistles produce a lovely purple / mauve bloom, but some species are known for their yellow inflorescence (cabbage thistle – Cirsium oleraceum and the Carline thistle – Carlina vulgaris). In all of the thistles, flowers give way to copious amounts of fluffy hairs (pappus) attached to their tiny fruits, superbly designed for air-borne dispersal. A distinguishing feature between the two main generais that Cirsium spp. produce feathered pappus hairs, whereas Carduus spp. only have simple pappus hairs. Creeping thistle produces dense spines on its leaves, but very few spines or hairs on the flowering stems. Spear thistle has large, deeply-lobed leaves with large spines at the margins, as well as hairy, spiny stems. Marsh thistle looks somewhat like spear thistle at an initial glance, but without the large spines and leaf lobes, and usually with a thin, red, leaf margin. Woolly thistle is easily identifiable with large, deeply-lobed, evenly-shaped leaves, and very large flower heads, wrapped in a ‘cobweb’ of cotton-like hairs. This particular species is the largest wild thistle I use, although if you have milk thistle (Silybum marianum) growing in your plot, you can use that too, but you will need good gloves to protect yourself from its long spiny flower heads! Eating milk thistle chokes would of course prevent you harvesting the exceptional liver-supportive medicine found in the seeds. Wooly thistle Creeping thistle will grow in all manner of waste-ground, grasslands, verges and field edges. I also see a lot of spear thistle in similar habitats, although when found in grassland, it’s not as abundant as the creeping species. The root systems explain why; spear thistle has a tap root, whereas creeping thistle grows on rhizomes. The marsh thistle, as its name alludes to, likes damp conditions such as fens, marshes, canal tow-paths and riversides. Woolly thistle is a little bit more selective in its choice of soil and setting, preferring calcareous ground. It too enjoys grasslands. Welted thistle can be found all over the UK, especially loving clay soils. Go prepared! Stiff gloves and a knife are required. Harvest the best leaf mid-ribs in spring when growth is plentiful and quick. Your specimens will be tender and sweeter. Flowering stems will appear from late spring through into autumn. I only consider harvesting from plants whose flower buds are yet to really begin unfurling. Flower buds (chokes) are available all summer. In Portugal, a number of thistle species are still collected in spring and sold at markets. A recent academic study highlighted the nutritional value from eating thistles. The findings are contained within ‘Ethnobotany In The New Europe’ by Manuel. P de Santayana et al. (Eds), published June 2010. In the study, researchers noted the wide range of thistle species collected, and concentrated on the nutritional value of one particular thistle (Scolymus hispanicus – Spanish or golden thistle). This plant is collected by villagers in various areas of the countryside. Bunches of the stripped leaf mid-ribs are sold and bought in a number of markets in different areas. Levels of certain nutrients were analysed and compared to some commonly consumed vegetables. Their findings show that the thistle contained consistently higher levels of important major nutrients than some of our commonly consumed cultivated vegetables. Weight for weight, thistles come out higher in fibre, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc and other nutrients. Is it likely that the thistles found wild here will be similarly endowed with a range of important vitamins and minerals? I’m more than happy to work on the assumption that this will be the case. Many other wild plant species are known to contain high concentrations of important nutrients. Preparing thistles is pretty easy. Simply choose the most tender specimens. If using the petioles, then cut and strip all the spines off, before peeling the outer, fibrous layer from the stalk. Use raw as crudités, pickle or ferment them, or chop into salads and serve them with a tangy vinaigrette. If cooking, they don’t require long! Preparing the stems is similar, but they are hollow. These can be used in similar ways to the petioles, or you can stuff them, roast them, and braise them. As relatives of the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), thistles produce edible, if smaller, ‘chokes’. These are the crunchy, immature bases, or capitulum, of the composite flower-head. As you would do with globe artichokes, peel away the bracts to get to the prize. I only choose the largest wild species for this. Happy foraging!

"Some plants seem to be our constant companions, no matter where we live. Often, they will also be some of our really useful species. It will soon become clear that the common mallow (Malva sylvestris) is one of these plants. Rather than being looked upon as a weed, the mallows can be more usefully described as some of our gloriously abundant plant helpers. A number of mallow species have long been used as a food and medicine, wherever they are found native, and especially in the Middle East and Asia. You won’t have far to go to find the common mallow in most parts of Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia either. Common mallow can be found growing erect or prostrate, which may initially cause confusion because it’s easy to assume they might be two different species. Mallow’s kidney-shaped or palmately-lobed leaves are notably creased, typically with dentate margins. The leaves often show a purple spot in the centre of the base of the leaf and this can also be seen to run down the petiole on some specimens. On other specimens, the purple spotting and colouring is completely absent. Mallow leaves have long petioles. Their deep green foliage hints at a renowned drought tolerance. During flowering, the leaves appear alternately on the stems. Holding a leaf relays the surface coarseness. But tear and crush one, and you discover a family pattern – the mucilage. You will soon experience a slimy and tacky feel between your fingers. All parts of the plant contain mucilage. In bloom, the Malvaceae family plants produce five large notched petals in each open flower. Common mallow has showy pink petals laced with darker-coloured strokes. In the centre of the flower lies a pollen-loaded column of fused stamens. This surrounds the stigma, which rises above the column.  Mallow is known to freely seed. The round seed pods, known as ‘cheeses’, soon follow flowering. These were once munched by children on their way to and from school. The pods are held on stalks, close to the flowering stem. Mallow will be found on most soils, from coastal to marginally upland habitats, with most settings being adequate for this resilient plant. It loves waste-ground as well as grassland; gravel as much as coastal edges, and waysides and roadsides as well as hedges.  Leaves, flowers, seed pods, roots. Leaves, in spring; flowers from late spring; seed pods from early summer. Roots could be harvested from larger rosettes whenever large enough. Medicinal and nutritional constituents Vitamins A,B,C,E; inulin; mucilage; phenols; flavonoids; essential fatty acids; fibre; calcium; magnesium; zinc; selenium; potassium. Traditional and contemporary uses As with many wild food plants, the common mallow has also had a long history of medicinal use. Due to its high mucilage content, mallows make excellent soothing demulcent herbs, especially for cases of inflammation, either for the urinary, digestive or respiratory systems. Pregnant women or new mothers may like to know that mallow leaves can provide useful amounts of iron, as well as being quite high in zinc and most vitamins.  All of the mallow family with exception to the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum), are reportedly edible. With their high mucilage content, the leaves can usefully be taken as an emergency antidote to irritation or burning that may be caused by the accidental consumption of acrid plants in the buttercup family. Creative cooks can substitute mallow for spinach in many dishes, including soups, salads, gnocchi and quiche. I have even flash-fried larger mallow leaves for just one second in hot oil to make ‘popadoms’. Mallow also makes a great addition to soups, whereby the mucilage helps to thicken them.  In Jewish culture, mallow has been been considered the ‘most important plant in local gather society’. Every spring mallow is gathered in the countryside. Its common name in both Hebrew and Arabic, translates to ‘bread’.  During the war of 1948, when Jerusalem was under siege, mallow was an important famine crop, and one that is still celebrated on Independence day every year with a traditional dish made from mallow leaves. Common mallow can be substituted for the family relative Corchorus olitorius aka ‘jutes mallow’, when making the Egyptian / Middle-Eastern dish ‘Molokhia’. This traditional dish is usually served with chicken.  In China, mallow roots are a popular and a common ingredient in making hearty, yet medicinally potent soups and broths. The inulin-rich tap roots of a number of different mallow species, including common mallow, have been used. The seed pods can be substituted for most of the egg white if wanting to make mallow meringues. Simply boil up the peeled seed pods using 3 parts water 1 part seed pods, and reduce the liquid by half. For every half cup of liquid add one egg white, ¼ tsp of cream of tartar, some vanilla and castor sugar, then whip it up until foamy and stiff, just like meringues.  21st Century Foraging  The Medicinal Forest Garden  The Fast Wild Food Cookbookby Johnny Jumbalaya  Amazing Moringa: Medicinal, Edible & Easy to Grow  How to Make your own Sloe Gin Chris Hope, aka Chris Phyto, was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic plant lover, forager and teacher, who sadly died in 2021.";Permaculture Magazine UK

1 red pepper, diced
100g (3.5 oz/2 cups) spinach or chard, chopped
Olive oil
800g (28 oz/5 ⅓ cup) tomatoes, chopped
Plus 2 or 3 tomatoes, sliced, to decorate
240g (8.5 oz/1.5 cups) cooked beans
(400g tin, drained)
1-2 tbsp chopped herbs – basil, parsley or oregano (or a mixture of all three)
Salt and pepper to taste For the garlic bread
A crusty loaf of bread 
4-10 cloves garlic (I like it strong!)
0.5-1 cup olive oil (it depends how large the loaf is)
Pepper
An oven dish approximately 25 x 25cm (10 x 10in) Preheat the oven to 180oC fan (200oC/400oF/gas mark 6). Finely chop the garlic and mix into the olive oil. Add a little pepper, stir and leave to infuse. Slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways into 5mm thick slices. Pour some olive oil into the pan and soften the onions, garlic and celery on a low heat.  When cooked, add the red pepper, beans and tomatoes. Simmer for around 15 minutes until the sauce is cooked through. Meanwhile, drizzle olive oil onto a griddle and cook the aubergines and courgettes, several slices at a time, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Pour some of the tomato sauce into the oven dish, add a layer of aubergine, then more sauce, a layer of courgette, and so on until the dish is filled with layers of sauce, aubergine and courgette. Decorate with slices of tomato. Put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Slice the bread so the knife goes about 90% through the loaf, leaving the base intact and the slices attached to each other. Put in a baking dish and, using a spoon, drizzle the garlic oil over both sides of each slice.  15 minutes before the lasagne is ready, put the bread in the oven. When the lasagne is cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the crusty garlic bread and a large salad, or dish of steamed seasonal green vegetables. Tip – Frying pan will work if you don’t have a griddle. This recipe adapts well to other vegetables. In the winter, use slices of cooked potato, parsnip, sweet potato or squash. Cooked whole cabbage and kale leaves make lovely ‘lasagne sheets’ too.  The Creative Kitchenby Stephanie Hafferty  No Dig Organic Home and Gardenby Stephanie Hafferty and Charles Dowding  Seasonal Pesto and Hummus Recipes  Growing Winter Salads Stephanie Hafferty is a no dig gardener, writer and author of The Creative Kitchen and coauthor of No Dig Organic Home and Garden.";Permaculture Magazine UK
"My name is Suzanne Pendleton and I live in Swinton, Salford (UK) and have been involved in the Greater Manchester Swift Street initiative since August 2024, which has been led by the RSPB. During lockdown I started to value my time outside as so many families did too. I enjoyed time in our little garden more and spotted some birds as they zoomed and screamed over the house. I wasn’t quite sure what they were and asked my friend Kathleen who lived on a surrounding road what they might be. She enlightened me. They were Swifts, a species recently added to the UK’s Red List of birds, meaning they are now amongst our most threatened. Then the summer was over and the swifts left Swinton heading back to Africa.  Each year since, I have eagerly anticipated the return of the Swifts. My understanding grew and I learnt of their declining numbers, now less than 60,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Along with developing a stiff neck constantly looking up to the sky, watching their incredible aerial manoeuvres.  I am privileged to live in a friendly neighbourhood on our lane. The community are always up for helping, and we pull together to help each other. We have a community messaging service which came into its own in lockdown, and continues to be a fabulous way to share information and request help and advice. During the last few years I had messaged our community group and asked if anyone knew about our Swifts and where they were nesting. Initially we were unsuccessful in understanding, but in spring 2024 we struck lucky and finally worked out the eaves where they lived. I’d also discovered Swift Mapper (an app for recording the location of Swift nesting sites) enabling us to understand we had four nest sites on the Lane and surrounding roads.  We also realised that there was another small colony locally less that 1/4 mile away. Last August, a resident of this local road got in touch to say Roshni (Parmar-Hill, Community Engagement Officer) from the RSPB had been to visit their colony. She asked if we’d be interested in getting involved with developing our Swift Street – thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery – and I eagerly accepted the offer. We used our community messaging group to share the news of the Swift Street development and I was overwhelmed by the local response. So many families were keen to help our Swift population, with more than 80 boxes requested. I think the consensus was that we are so privileged that these incredible urban birds choose our lane as their home, and as their nesting places can be threatened by redevelopment, having the opportunity to install boxes is a wonderful chance to do something proactive to help.  Roshni and I visited local homes who had expressed interest, helping families select potential sites for their boxes to be positioned. With Roshni’s guidance we talked about what Swifts need and I and residents began to understand more about how Swifts live. They are remarkably compatible with humans, don’t need a bird bath, bird table etc. as they feed on insects on the wing. I discovered along with other residents that the best way we could help our Swifts was to protect their current nesting sites, add boxes for more birds to nest in and to do all we could to support insect populations. For example, considering planting in our gardens to promote insect life, adopting No Mow May and not using insecticides. Those who weren’t able to install a box could instead help in other ways, so this made the project accessible for all – everyone could join in. Next came the production of the boxes. Roshni contacted local colleges and we were thrilled when a local skills centre suggested their joinery students could make these free of charge. Production began and numbers of those interested had grown as the message about the project spread, and so 100 boxes were produced.  Meanwhile, local guiding groups learnt of the initiative and Roshni visited the groups that I lead, as Brown Owl – 90 girls and young women were keen to learn about Swifts and how they could help. The groups were already keen to learn about environmental matters, and this project really whetted their appetite. The Brownies, Guides and Rangers designed posters, made seed bombs and grew in their understanding of our Swifts. Once the production of the boxes was finished the Brownies, Rangers and Guides got stuck into painting them with an environmentally friendly product which would protect the boxes, and a local lady Haldis (a RSPB Swift Champion, a voluntary role which supports local conservation efforts to protect the species) made the nest cups which would be inserted into each box.  We arrived at installation day on Saturday 8th March, with 25 boxes going up on that first day. By the end of March, 80 had been erected by a local roofer, Ryan. Of course, we needed to celebrate the returning of our precious Swifts and so we began planning our community event. Volunteers came forward from the surrounding roads and we met in a resident’s kitchen each Wednesday, so all could contribute ideas. Other local guiding groups wanted to contribute and so they made nature-themed bunting, and we were thrilled when the church on the lane offered their venue as a space for us to celebrate. The local dance and drama group wanted to be involved and so their leaders and young people planned songs and a drama production with poetry. And as if we weren’t already exciting enough, we then heard the news that RSPB Ambassador Megan McCubbin would love to come along to formally open our Swift Street.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on 17th May, with a fantastic community event. Sixty families made bee hotels, children had Swift-themed face paint, and a plant swap was popular. RSPB provided and led crafts, and local artists supported youngsters to make Swift puppets. More than 300 residents attended and watched the young people perform. The ribbon was cut revealing a beautiful Swift Street banner created by a local artist, alongside Swift boxes 99 and 100 positioned proudly on the front of the church. And yes, we had Swifts soaring high above us all day (perhaps watching the proceedings?) to the delight of the watching children and residents. As the street party continued into the evening we couldn’t believe our eyes when a ‘banger’ (a young Swift, which gets its name from its tendency to bang against prospective nest to check if they’re occupied or not) attempted to enter one of the newly positioned boxes. A perfect end to a fabulous day.  It’s been an absolute honour to be involved in this project and I feel so lucky that our community have been able to do something practical to support our local Swifts.

"We are delighted to announce the recipients of the 2025 Permaculture Magazine Award, in collaboration with Lush Spring Prize. Four projects have been awarded from a fund of £25,000. The Permaculture Magazine Award is a celebration of the vital work of permaculture projects from around the world. The Permaculture Magazine Award was established in 2018 to celebrate the vital work of permaculture projects around the world. To date (May 2025) it has awarded 28 projects with over £155,000. The award has received hundreds of applications, and it is a privilege to highlight this vital regenerative work that is world changing. Coordinating a network of permaculture centres, NGO Permaculture Ukraine offers training, events and educational resources across Ukraine, also ensuring accessibility for internally displaced people (IDP) and former military personnel. The organisation was founded following the first Permaculture Design Course (PDC) in Ukraine in 2011, and has held at least one PDC annually, actively seeking funding to make training accessible to vulnerable groups. Following the full-scale invasion in 2022, its focus expanded to include: The 14 permaculture centres provide training, shelter for IDPs and war-abandoned animals, and rehabilitation for children and adults. Its designers also create communal projects, including schools and homes for disabled people. Despite air raids and blackouts, NGO Permaculture Ukraine successfully hosted a two-day permaculture festival in Kyiv’s botanical garden in September 2024, drawing 100 participants eager to engage with top regenerative practitioners. NGO Permaculture Ukraine empowers Ukrainians for sustainable living and transformative change. Through active social media engagement and collaborations with ecovillages, zero-waste networks, and other ecological movements, it extends its influence and inspires a growing audience to adopt permaculture principles for Ukraine’s regeneration. https://permaculture.in.ua Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Since its founding in 2021, Battmung has: Recognising the importance of connecting people, Battmung also contributed to the founding of the Permaculture Institute of Korea (P.I.K) in 2023. Its goal is to organise its regional network and regenerate South Korea through permaculture, restoring soil, food chains, ecological awareness, and local economies. www.instagram.com/battmung.log Eco Centro Allpa Tarpuna works for the regeneration of degraded lands, food sovereignty and community autonomy, with a focus on indigenous communities in Ecuador. Founded in 2004, it was born out of the return of its founders to their community after experiencing the negative impacts of conventional agriculture and agrochemicals. This return marked the beginning of a path towards reconnecting with indigenous ancestral knowledge and adopting permaculture and organic production. One of the key achievements has been the recovery of soils degraded by monocultures and eucalyptus. Although slow, this process has demonstrated the benefits of a regenerative approach and strengthened the resilience of the community. Allpa Tarpuna is currently focusing on: Allpa Tarpuna integrates bio-construction, renewable energy and sustainable water management into its practices. It also encourages the preservation of ancestral seeds and agro-ecological techniques such as crop rotation, reducing dependence on chemicals. In the future, it wants to expand its training in permaculture design, combining indigenous knowledge with modern regenerative solutions. It seeks to empower more local farmers, promoting designs that restore the connection between people and nature. Allpa Tarpuna is a living indigenous family that sows regeneration, inspiring a sustainable and resilient balance. https://allpatarpuna.org HortaFCUL is a community-based permaculture project based in Lisbon University’s Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). The initiative was launched by a group of biology students concerned about the gap between sustainability ideals and the university’s environmental impact. This bottom-up project has developed an important role as a catalyst of practical scientific-based knowledge. Nowadays, HortaFCUL is a resilient, sustainable and inclusive community, allowing the general public to learn more about nature-based solutions. It has five subprojects at campus level and relies on a volunteer-based horizontally-organised guardians collective to maintain the project’s green areas. HortaFCUL, as a permaculture project, achieves its central goals by closing functional loops related to human activities.

"As politicians wait, grassroots changemakers are restoring ecosystems and rebuilding resilience. They are living examples that regeneration is not just possible, it’s already happening all over the world.  The Lush Spring Prize 2025 is showcasing this work and has awarded around £250,000 to 19 groups, celebrating regenerative organisations and practitioners from around the world. Lead image: Clockwise from top left: Agro-Pueblos (Colombia), Ñu’u Ndito (Mexico), Global Ecovillage Network (Global), Land in Our Names (UK) In a joyous, collaborative and inspiring week of celebrations, the 2025 recipients were honoured as part of a celebratory event held in Dorset (UK), where the Lush Cosmetics company is headquartered. The event was attended by prize recipients, Spring Prize judges, Lush staff, press, funders and other regenerative practitioners. Co-designed with the prize recipients themselves, the event provides a space to connect, co-learn and share stories of regeneration. It offered an opportunity to explore both the diversity of people and organisations that make up the regenerative movement and the common challenges, learnings and successes that unites it. Each Spring Prize year sees different themes emerge that are shaped by the organisations that receive a prize. In 2025, these include the importance of weaving ancestral wisdom with scientific approaches; working at multiple scales and legally recognising the rights of nature, and learning from those on the frontlines that are facilitating regenerative work in conflict zones or regions experiencing natural disasters. In 2025, the backdrop of violence and conflict looms large. Prize recipients from Lebanon and Ukraine are responding to invasions by powerful aggressors, in Myanmar they are working in a context of ongoing internal conflict and many of the Indigenous groups are frequently facing the threat of violence.  The Spring Prize 2025 event allows these groups to come together and share what regenerative work in these situations looks like in a way that may challenge the existing narrative: “In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the biggest achievement for our organisation is to continue our activities and find ways to be useful for Ukrainian society like creating permaculture public spaces and rehabilitating people in our demonstration centers. The war has taught us that strength is in unity and networks, that autonomous homesteads and farms that grow their own food and preserve their seeds can not only survive but also help other people, and that international support and networks matter.” NGO Permaculture in Ukraine While humanity witnesses declining biodiversity, climate catastrophes and widespread conflict, these organisations highlight how regenerative practices are not just a source of hope but a necessary and much needed response.

Examples of this year’s awarded projects include: Aguaje palm tree seedlings were distributed among Kukama families in Parinari, Loreto, Peru, as part of the reforestation and conservation initiative led by Huaynakana. Extractivism represents a constant threat to the Kukama territory in Peru and the loss of the Kukama peoples’ cultural identity. Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana exists to protect this. The Kukama people conceive of the territory as a whole and women having an intrinsic connection to it. The term ‘kukama’ for example is composed of two words: ‘ku’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘kama’ meaning ‘bosom,’ and it signifies ‘field-bosom’ or ‘nourished by the field.’ Given the Kukama peoples’ lives are reliant on the forest ecosystems of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and considering how they have adapted and coexisted with them for decades, the territory and the rivers are inseparable from their culture and way of life. They consider the rivers to be living beings with spirits, and therefore sacred. Founded in 2001, Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana embarked on a long journey of collective actions, protests, and mobilisations in pursuit of environmental justice as the river’s health declined as a result of extractive industries. In September 2021 Huaynakana filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognise the Marañón River as a living being and subject of rights. In March 2024, the provincial court of Nauta ruled that the Marañón River has intrinsic rights, including the right to flow, to be free from pollution, and to be restored to environmental health. This decision also recognised Indigenous communities as the river’s legal representatives, defenders, and guardians. This landmark ruling was ratified by the higher court last November. Huaynakana plays a key role in defending the Marañón’s rights and supporting the regeneration and conservation of the waterways through reforestation efforts because without the river, these unique forests cannot exist. Mushrooms harvested from the Ubuntu food forest Ubuntu Learning Hub Trust was set up in 2022 with a mission to support people who are in transition towards more resilient futures and a healthier planet. The Trust immediately began to set up the Ubuntu Learning Centre as an open learning space for all ages as well as a demonstration centre for integrating technologies that are in tune with a healthy Mother Earth. The learning centre sits on a two-hectare site in Chikancila village in Chongwe district of Lusaka Province of Zambia. It is founded on the African philosophy of Ubuntu which helps people to learn what it means to be truly human. It hosts people from all walks of life who are looking for pathways to escape the rat race and curve more sustainable futures for themselves, their families and the communities where they come from. The Trust uses agro-ecological practices to regenerate the degraded farmland that was damaged over decades of poor land husbandry. For example, the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) technique has helped to restore much of the indigenous vegetation on the land. People come to Ubuntu to explore the meaning of life and to find their life purpose. They stay at Ubuntu for varying lengths of time and in the process they are engaged in intercultural exchanges as well as learning how to take care of themselves and of Mother Earth. The Trust offers life changing experiences rather than certificates and the opportunity to carve out an earth-centred worldview for themselves.

Harvesting with Battmung friends The LUSH Spring Prize is a joint venture between LUSH Cosmetics and Ethical Consumer and is now in its sixth prize cycle, having started in 2017. The Spring Prize has distributed more than £1.3 million to regenerative projects worldwide. The LUSH Spring Prize was set up to support ‘regenerative’ projects – those that go beyond sustainability by taking holistic approaches to building the health of ecology, economy and social systems. It seeks to support those who are leaving the world lusher than they found it, and are actively restoring all the systems they are part of. By supporting regenerative projects the Spring Prize hopes to raise the profile of the movement as a whole to inspire more individuals, groups, communities, funders, media platforms and businesses to start engaging with regenerative processes.  The Spring Prize judging panels are made up of people drawn from a diverse range of movements that represent regenerative design, permaculture, food sovereignty, transition towns, biomimicry, eco-village networks and various social justice movements. Each prize cycle a ‘Lush Customer Judge’ and ‘Lush Staff Judge’ are also selected to act as additional independent members of the judging panel.  The collaborative prizes have separate panels, which also include judges from the main Spring Prize panel. The majority of the judging panel for the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Award self identify as Indigenous themselves, some being previous recipients of the award. The judges are not just involved in choosing the recipients but are involved in shaping the prize as a whole, attending the event and connecting with prize recipients.

"Around 40 years ago, the Sahel, an extremely arid region located in central Africa, was an area of agricultural desolation. Due to natural factors such as heavy drought and interannual variability, combined with anthropocentric influences like climate change, overgrazing and deforestation, the environment has become particularly unstable with little possibility for productivity.  Furthermore, when rain does fall in the arid region, the soil is so dry due to a lack of precipitation, that water immediately ‘runs off’ or evaporates, failing to soak into the depleted earth. Some countries within the region, such as Burkina Faso, faced up to 24% of their arable lands classed as highly degraded in 1998 (Maatman et al., 1998).  In the early 2000s, NGOs and organisations such as the United Nations, the World Food Programme and WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), amongst others, sought to reverse the desertification of many parts of Africa, including the Sahel, in cooperation with farmers and communities from the affected regions. Using the ancient ‘half moon’ water harvesting technique – used for centuries in Africa and the Middle East, the revitalised technique aims to facilitate water retention and re-green the ecosystem. Heavy machinery or hand tools can be used to plough the soil roughly 30cm down in a semi-circle or ‘half moon’ shape. The diameter of these half moons are typically about 4 metres. When it rains, the contours catch the rainwater, preventing runoff and allowing it to infiltrate the soil. This creates ‘favourable micro-climate conditions’ allowing drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet to be planted.  If planted on steep slopes, half-moon ‘bunds’ can assist the growth of tree species. They can also be used in combination with controlled grazing to boost re-vegetation. In Niger, The World Food Programme (WFP) has been implementing half-moon planting projects since 2014. Just 5 years into the scheme, the benefits of its implementation were examined by a progress-review. In 2019, over 400 households had restored approximately 3,000 acres of land, largely for use in producing food for livestock. This has promoted social cohesion and economic growth by providing more jobs and stabilising agricultural output in a formerly capricious climate. This scenario exhibits the benefits of a localised, small-scale regenerative farming technique such as half-moon planting through its trickle-down effects, stipulating broader socio-economic growth. A study on the impact of reformed agroecological techniques was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Burkina Faso. Figures revealed that fields ploughed using the half-moon method saw the rates of increase for grain yield at 8% (The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 2017). As farmers sought new ways to boost crop yields, regenerative farming techniques such as the half-moon method were found to be successful when used in conjunction with others. In Burkina Faso, half-moon planting is exercised alongside the Zaï technique, which is useful when adapting to various soil types and structures. The Zaï method, suitable to the arid Sahel region, uses similar methods seen in the half-moons, but alternatively involves digging smaller pits in non-permeable soil to intercept water and gather compost material. These pits are slightly smaller than the half-moons and so are less labour intensive and can be utilised in smaller growing plots. They are roughly between 15-50cm across; 5-15cm deep; and positioned 80cm apart. This technique was reintroduced to the area in the 1980s by farmer and agronomist Yacouba Sawadogo, who pioneered the method of filling the holes with manure to further break up the earth and bolster soil productivity.

"Traditional Māori time systems were measured in accordance to the night as opposed to the Western proxy of daylight. Each night of the lunar month had a particular name and this cumulatively formed a lunar calendar known as ‘Maramataka‘. Farming according to the Maramataka lunar calendar is used in conjunction with Māori regenerative farming techniques to adapt to nature’s schedule as opposed to imposing controls on the earth’s processes. Many farmers are now seeking to turn back to these ancient methods in line with broader sustainability imperatives. Under the Maramataka calendar, individual lunar nights were marked according to how optimal they were for catching fish, eels or planting crops, with each night having its own name. A good example is eel fishing. It is not productive on a full moon – Rākaunui – because the moon’s light would not allow eel to hunt their prey, as the prey could see them. As with biodynamics (the Rudolf Steiner lunar approach for farming), planting crops is nest at a full moon, when the gravitational pull is at its highest, because it has maximum influence on water in the soil. “Despite the use of Maramataka being limited to a relative few today, largely because of colonisation, interest in and revival of this knowledge and practice is growing.”1 Many farmers are returning to the use of farming tactics such as Maramataka planting in line with broader regenerative goals. The Revitalise Te Taiao programme aims to fund sustainable and lucrative agribusiness solutions to cultivate Te Taiao (the natural world). This project provided $2.7 million in funding to Miru Young and Mohi Beckham, farmers based in the North Island’s Bay of Plenty, to trial agriculture techniques which aim to “enhance the mana and mauri of the soil” across 10 farm sites. As part of the scheme, both farmers undertook rigorous research, sowing pasture throughout different moon phases from resting and dormant phases to high-energy phases for plant growth. Soon, grass seeds sown during the high energy periods of the Maramataka calendar outgrew neighbouring crops planted in other phases, even if the latter had been sown 10 days before. Despite still being in the trial stages of Maramataka planting, Miru and Mohi observed various positive impacts of the scheme within the first few months. Their land has seen higher productivity and crop yields, with a 93% crop survival rate under Maramataka planting, that is an increase of 13% from the usual 80% under previous methods. One of the main issues associated with returning to traditional farming methods on a broader scale is competing with intensive methods in New Zealand’s modern agricultural industry. After settlers from the West arrived in New Zealand during the 18th and 19th centuries, intensive farming practices quickly became widespread.  As farming in the country has continuously expanded into the modern day, with agricultural exports making up a large proportion of the country’s GDP, traditional farming methods have become far less lucrative in the broader market. This meant that Māori farmers had to adopt newer techniques, as those trying to maintain the traditional methods were faced with far lower crop yields and income. Rural management programmes and sustainability objectives are constantly investigating new and feasible ways to rejuvenate te ao Māori farming techniques, with the Revitalise Te Taiao programme representing just one of many schemes. The Maramataka lunar calendar is part of a broader Maori worldview known as Mātauranga Māori – a term used to describe the collective knowledge of Māori living in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the knowledge passed down from their ancestors. Kaitiakitanga (stewardship/management) and the link between Whakapapa (Māori genealogy/ancestral descent) and Whenua (land) are key areas of te ao Māori and Mātauranga values.  By embracing schools of thought that are native to Aotearoa, alongside promoting equitable stewardship across modern farming methodologies, high agricultural output can be attained. Reforming the agribusiness in New Zealand will involve reintegrating Māori into decision making processes, embracing cross-cultural thought processes and utilising western technological advancements for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.

"Lammas is a celebration of the summer and the gathering in of the grain harvest. This was especially significant in the past. After all the hard work of getting the grain crop cut, threshed, stored and stacked, there came a time for feasting, celebration and assessment. Lammas is a Saxon name meaning ‘Loaf-mass’. Lughnasadh (pronounced Loo-nas-ah) is Irish Gaelic. On Lammas Eve fires were lit on Lammas mounds such as Silbury Hill at Avebury, to honour the Corn Mother as she gives birth to her harvest child, the Grain. This is the seed that will bring next year’s harvest as well as the grain that will sustain life throughout the winter. The month of August was the month of the Grain Mother. An ‘augur’ is an old word for seer and meant ‘increaser’. The great abundance of the Earth Mother is reflected in the titles she was given at this time: The Grain Mother, Barley Mother, Corn Mother, Demeter, Ceres, Cerealia, Grain, the Wise One of the Earth, the Increaser, She who is the seed, who is the womb, who is the soil, the Great Provider, the Preserver of Life. Cutting the ‘corn’ seems to be a general term for all cereal crops, whether they are wheat, barley, rye or oats. There were many customs and rituals throughout Europe to honour the first and the last sheaf of corn to be cut. The last sheaf was often cut by the youngest girl present and fashioned into a Corn Maiden. It was carried joyfully back to the village, sometimes plaited and decked with ribbons, and usually hung over the fireplace. Sometimes it was dressed in women’s clothes, and ritually burnt on the Lammas Fire. Sometimes these Corn Maidens were kept until Yule when they were divided up amongst the cattle or kept until the spring. Sometimes they were kept with the date tied to them. Many Corn Maidens would be seen hanging above the fireplace. In Scotland the ‘young maid’ was made out of the last stalks cut, and kept. The ‘old wife’ was made out of the first stalks cut and was passed on to the nearest farm that had not finished bringing in the corn. This was then passed round until it ended up at the last farm to be cut. Another old European custom was to weave the last sheaf into a large Corn Mother with a smaller corn doll inside it, representing next year’s unborn harvest. The regenerative power of the Earth is never more manifest than now as the grain harvest is gathered in and the Sun’s cycle begins to wane. The Cauldron of Regeneration was central to Celtic spiritual understanding. We are renewed by sleep and darkness, through many deaths and rebirths, and by the sacrifice of our outer lives for the inner journey. Here at Lammas, the doorway to the inner realms is opening. This is the symbolism behind the Demeter/Kore/Persephone story. Demeter, the Corn Mother, represents the ripe corn of this year’s harvest, and Kore or Persephone represents the grain-seed who lives in the dark throughout the winter and reappears in the Spring. Persephone’s descent into the Underworld is a mythical interpretation of the seed lying in the ground during the dark winter months, and her reappearance as the young maid, or the new sprouting seed, in the spring. This story shows us the Triple Goddess in all her aspects: as Earth Mother, the abundant provider; as the Crone, the wisdom found within; and as the Maiden who returns renewed in the spring. Pluto/Hades’ abduction of Persephone is a later reworking of this older myth. After all the manifest energy and activity of the early summer, it is good to make time now to rest and to assimilate all that has happened during the Sun’s active phase. Lammas celebrations would probably have begun with the cutting of the last sheaf of corn. Although the 2nd of August is the calendar date for Lammas, the great Lammas fairs and feasts would probably have lasted from mid July to mid August and would have peaked around the time of the harvest Full Moon. Once the grain had been safely gathered in and the men returned from their hunting trips, it was a time for feasting, dancing and merry-making, a great celebration of the first of the harvest and assessment of the year’s achievements. Beer, wine, cider and whisky made from the previous year’s harvest, were ritually drunk, celebrating the transformative power of Fire and Water. Cooking fires were honoured as they too embodied the power of Fire and Water. Bread was made from the new grain and thanks were given to the Sun’s life energy reborn as the bread of life. This is a busy time for harvesting herbs and collecting herb seeds to sow in the spring. Give thanks and blessings as you pick them, dry them and store them. Review what you know about them and ways you can use them both physically and metaphysically. Harvest sage at the end of July, before the flowers have come out. Sage is a herb associated with wisdom and releasing blocks in expression. It is connected to the throat chakra and is for those who have something to say but cannot let it out. It will help you express your emotions. Make the herb tea in the usual way. The infusion is a useful antiseptic herb for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers and mouth infections. It can be used as a gargle, for bathing wounds, sores, and to stop bleeding. Use the tea infusion externally and then drink afterwards as well. It will dry up excess secretions such as catarrh or sinusitis. It contains oestrogen and is useful in the menopause and for delayed menstruation. Burn dried sage to cleanse and purify. Waft the smoke around a person to cleanse their aura (called smudging). This is a good way to begin any ritual or ceremony. N.B. It must not be taken if pregnant, and because of its drying action, it must not be taken for long periods of time. It will dry up mother’s milk. Care must be taken by those who are insulin-dependent, and to be avoided by epileptics. Garlands of meadowsweet were traditionally worn for the Lammas celebrations. Its heady perfume expands the psyche, and builds inner strength. It enhances flexibility and connection to the inner levels. It is a mild sedative and painkiller containing salicylic acid (aspirin) that affects the rate at which blood clots. It is a good digestive tonic that reduces excess acidity and is useful for heartburn, hyperacidity, gastritis and peptic ulcers. As it cleanses the body of harmful acids, it is useful for any inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is a strong diuretic (increases urine) and can be used for any bladder or kidney complaint including cystitis. It reduces stagnation in the liver and therefore will help the immune system function more effectively. Its harvest time is July and August when the flowers are just beginning to open. Collect them in brown paper bags to dry for later use. N.B. Avoid if on anti-coagulant drugs. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Sacred Earth Celebrations, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"There are various methods for drying herbs for herbal recipes but they all require that the herb is dried and stored out of the light. I prefer to use brown paper bags, other people hang them up in bunches or lay them between sheets of newspaper or brown paper. • If using brown paper bags always label the bags with the name of the herb, the date and where you picked it. This is good practice and a good habit to get into as plants can change a lot in the drying process. Even if you think you will know what it is, it is surprising how you can forget, especially if you bag up several herbs over a period of a few weeks. • Leave the bags in a dry warm environment for several weeks. Put them in the airing cupboard if you have one, hang over the wood-burner or leave them on top of radiators. Shake the bags and turn the leaves over with your hands every day or two. It is essential to do this to stop any mould getting in to the herbs while they are still drying. • The herbal properties of leaves and flowers will deteriorate after 1 year so they need to be re-collected every year. Fruit, seeds, berries, roots and bark will last for 2 years. It is light that destroys the herbal properties of herbs, so at its simplest herbs can be stored all year in brown paper bags, although if they are kept in the kitchen they will need to be kept in a plastic container or airtight tin to keep them dry. Keeping the herbs in a dedicated leather or cotton bag is the traditional medicine way and these are hung somewhere warm and dry, near a radiator or fire. Putting them into dark glass jars is good in a kitchen because of the condensation. Clear jam jars are fine if they are kept in a dark cupboard. At its simplest the jar can be kept in a brown paper bag or more creative ways can be found. Herb teas vary in taste and quality. Buying popular blends as tea bags is convenient, but be aware that the herbs may be old by the time you drink them, and the herbs may have been grown in monocultures and sprayed with petrochemicals. It is infinitely better to make your own. • Making herb teas is not an exact science, especially when using the common safe plants. Interestingly, different herbalists use different amounts. I use about a teaspoonful of dried herbs or a small pile that fits into the hollow of my palm, and between a half to a pint of water, depending on the need. Use less for young children and anyone who is weak and frail. Dried herbs have twice the strength of fresh herbs, so twice the amount of fresh herb is used. • As you make the tea, say thank you to the plant. This open-hearted attitude adds to the healing process. I like to picture the plant and affirm its healing qualities as I wait for the tea to brew, partly to affirm the healing I am engaged in and also as a memory aid. This way I keep learning and understanding more about the plants all the time and keep my knowledge strong. Many of the herbs are an acquired taste. Nurture an openness to these wild flavours and earthy tastes and give them a chance. More often than not, a taste you didn’t like at first becomes a taste that you find you love. These are also for adults only as they are a mixture of brandy and honey. This makes them a most delicious way to take your medicine! They are especially good to use when travelling as they are kept in small dropper bottles and taken neat. Elixirs are combination remedies, created for specific uses and personal needs. Elixirs need to taste good so the addition of any aromatic herbs improves the flavour, but must also support the over-all herbal action. They are experimental and fun, as well as being extremely effective and I like to give them creative names. Write up everything in your Herb Journal. This is especially important when you make combination elixirs. Recording the plants and proportions used is invaluable when you create something you want to repeat. Method one 1. Half fill a dark jar with a herb or combinations of herbs: tear the leaves, crush the seeds or fruit, and chop the roots. Send your thanks to the plants. Add a little of something that will give it a nice flavour such as rose petals, sweet violet, lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena etc, making sure that their actions support the overall use of the remedy. 2. Cover the plant matter with clear runny honey and send your silent thanks to the bees. Poke well with a chopstick to get out any trapped air bubbles and break the plant matter up further. 3. Then top the jar up with brandy and 4. Put on the lid and label, date and shake well. Give it a poke and a shake frequently and keep out of bright light. They are ready in about a month, although they come to no harm if they are left longer. 5. Strain off the plant matter and rebottle in clean dark dropper bottles. Pour a little boiling water over the mash of herbs that are left over, getting every last bit of goodness out of them. Toast the plant and its medicine and have your first taste before returning the spent mash to the earth with thanks. Method two Create an instant elixir using the tinctures you have made. 1. Using a jug combine several tinctures that support the remedy you are making. 2. Mix in a similar amount of honey to tincture and mix the two together. 3. Pour into dark dropper bottles. Name and date and write up in your herb journal. Their dosage is similar to tinctures, although I tend to use them little and often. Here are some suggestions of plants to choose from, depending on what you have available. I have listed the native plants first and the aromatics at the end. Anti-stress elixir Hawthorn, cowslip, vervain, rose petals, lavender, borage. Drops of calm Hawthorn, elderflowers, cowslip, hops, valerian, vervain, rose petals, borage, lavender, chamomile. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Letting in the Wild Edges, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"Growing my own mulch has long been a goal of mine. We use a lot of mulch in the nursery and garden and at the moment I have no problem sourcing straw but if/when the day comes that the farmers start using their own straw to improve their soil (which is becoming a more common practice), I’ll be needing to step up my mulch growing efforts. Currently, I grow enough mulch to sustain my perennial beds and around 10% of my annual beds but rely on imported straw for mulching the other 90% of annual vegetable and nursery beds. My ideal mulch plant grows fast, is drought tolerant, competes minimally with crop plants, does not contain seed that easily spreads, is easy to handle and cut, i.e. not thorny/prickly or tough and fibrous, and can biodegrade relatively quickly (thereby returning the nutrients back to soil). I’ve broadly categorized the main sources of mulch we produce in our 1500m2 garden. Aquatic plants
I grow emergent wetland species such us cattails (Typha spp), sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) on the banks of a small pond (6m x 3m), and within a grey water reed bed (1m x 6m). The pond also provides suitable habitat for hornworts (Ceratophyllum spp). a submerged rootless perennial that gathers on the surface en masse. This plant makes an excellent mulch being rich in nitrogen, growing very fast and is easy to position around the base of plants. The emergent species provide a good thick carbon rich mulch that helps to reduce evaporation on the terrestrial beds and I cut these back in the spring in case they are used for overwintering invertebrates. Aquatic plants are an excellent source of mulch as there are no issues with seed germinating amongst your land based crops. Tap rooted perennial / biennials
Deep rooted perennial plants tend to produce a good amount of biomass, are generally drought tolerant and do not compete strongly with our crop plants. I have found native biennial weeds such as greater burdock (Arctium lappa), a very useful mulch plant with the gigantic leaves growing back very fast after a cut. Lesser burdock (Arctium minus), is also useful albeit to lesser extent. Although biennial, if you cut back these plants before flowering you can prolong their life, harvesting good quantities of seed free biomass. I do eventually allow some of the plants to flower and they are much loved by bees among other insects. Comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum), ‘bocking 14’, is a classic example of a deep rooted mulch plant. We have the plant scattered throughout the garden and planted in dedicated patches. The plants do require irrigation however and will only provide good leaf yields if grown on fertile soil. Peeing on the plants is recommended. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), provide a great source of biomass. For a good tuber harvest it’s best to wait until the end of the season before harvesting the mulch. We can never consume as much as we produce of these tubers in the kitchen. I have found them to be much appreciated by our pigs and an excellent source of fresh winter food for our rabbits. Leaves of greater burdock (Arctium lappa) Nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs 
These plants take a while to establish but make an excellent contribution. I’ve had good results from coppicing empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), when they are 3-years-old and chop and dropping the soft new growth three or four times a year. I am expecting to also see good results from grey alder (Alnus incana) and Italian alder (Alnus cordata). I avoid using thorny nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs for this purpose. Annual trimming of shrubs such as autumn olive – Elaeagnus umbellata and broom – Cytisus scoparius also provides good quantities of mulch. Click here for more info on nitrogen fixing plants. Lawn and ground cover
One of my favourite sources of mulch is lawn trimmings. They are great for mulching potted plants or applying a mulch into tight spots. Mixed species lawns will contain a more diverse mix of mineral nutrients. Lawns including a legume such as white clover (Trifolim repens), can provide a nitrogen rich mulch. It’s a good idea to leave some of the trimmings behind to keep the lawn healthy. Autumn leaf fall and herbaceous stem residue
The annual shedding of leaves from trees and shrubs in our garden make a great contribution to our mulch capital. Leaves can be cleared from paths, lawns and wildflower beds (as they will disrupt the growth in these areas) and concentrated where they are of benefit such as the base of high demanding fruiting shrubs such as blackcurrants or blackberries. Herbaceous perennials such as lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis) and mints (Mentha spp). will provide dead stems annually. It’s always a good idea to leave hollow stems of some herbaceous perennials to remain for the winter as they are utilized by invertebrates for egg laying and hibernating. If the plant does not have a hollow stem it can be cut back and used for mulch. Fennel (Foeniculm vulgare), provides large quantities of biomass and as far as I can tell the stems are not utilised by any organism over the winter. In the vegetable garden all the remnants of my crops after harvesting go straight back to the surface for recycling. Foeniculum vulgare and other herbaceous perennials Tree prunings
Woody prunings from shrubs, trees and vines cut into small pieces (5-10cm) make good mulch in the mature areas of the forest garden with well established fungal soils specializing in breaking down the lignified woody material. Living mulches 
In the more mature areas of the garden where the trees have established (5yrs and older) I have dispensed with mulch all together in favour of ground cover plants that can be considered living mulches. Some the most successful perennial living mulches I have found that form good dense cover in the shade include bugle (Ajuga reptans), spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), Caucasian stonecrop (Sedem spurium), perwinkle (Vinca major) and betony (Stachys officinalis). Lamium maculatum spreading well under a mullbery (Morus alba) Scaling up mulch production
In order to grow enough mulch to provide a water retaining, weed excluding barrier for my annual and nursery beds I would certainly need more space. A larger wetland area would be ideal, with aquatic species growing very fast and the seed bearing parts of the plants being non problematic to use on terrestrial beds. If you don’t have a reliable aquatic habitat, the next best option for growing quantities of mulch without irrigation and fertilization is probably grass. During my next post I’ll be sharing a plan where using the lessons garnered from small scale systems, we’ll be growing mulch to support approx 670 fruit trees and 1360 soft fruit shrubs on a 5ha Agroforestry Project (design layout below).

"There are many medicinal uses for elder – Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae family). It is an evocative tree, steeped in history, tradition, and folklore. This is one of our great food and medicinal plants, easily found in most areas of the British Isles where people have settled. It’s botanical name, Sambucus nigra, stems from the Greek word sambuke; a ‘musical pipe’, due to its hollow form supplying our ancestors a perfect wood for making pipes. The Latin ‘nigra’, means black, in allusion to the dark colour of ripe elder berry fruit. Elder is a deciduous woodland and hedgerow plant, native to Northern Europe and North America, and can be seen happily growing on most types of soil up to altitudes of approximately 470m. Superstition says to not cut elder down or burn them. This may be purely because of the toxic fumes which rise from burning elder wood, or it may be that the faeries will be really upset because you are destroying such a useful plant! Other legends have grown around this plant, such as that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who allegedly betrayed Jesus to the Romans, then said to have hanged himself from its branches. This story gave rise to the name of the edible fungus found all year round on the elder – the Jelly Ear. Elder can sometimes be found growing as a shrubby form, and sometimes like a tree on a single trunk, similar to other woodland-edge plants like hazel, hawthorn and blackthorn. A mature elder typically displays a domed crown, and will be spotted from a distance once you know it. Elders can reach 8m or more, although more commonly 5-6m or so, because of other limiting environmental factors. Ideally the plant likes a rich and damp soil in a sunny position. Elder does not like exposed sites or windy hillsides. The branches display numerous lenticels (air holes) and produce their stems with opposite pairs of buds. The buds are naked, without bud scales. The light brown, corky bark pattern on elder can appear quite similar to the invasive exotic, the ‘butterfly bush’ – Buddleja davidii. The similarity between Sambucus and Buddleja ends there. Elder’s leaves are completely different in form. They are compound, comprising of seven oval, serrated leaflets, each being about 7-10cm long. The leaflets typically come in two or three opposite pairs with one terminal leaflet. They are a much lighter green colour than the Himalayan native ‘butterfly bush’ which has a simple, lanceolate / elliptical leaf. You will find this year’s flowers and fruits on last year’s growth. The umbel-like elderflowers, (technically corymbs), are borne on terminal stems. Five creamy-white petals surround the yellow anthers. When ripe, and picked on a sunny day, are bursting with pollen and scent, and should be a bright lemon-yellow. They turn brown when past their best. Only pick ripe flowers! The flowers have a small amount of natural yeast on them which assists fermentation when making drinks. This will be testified by anyone who makes the superb thirst quenching elderflower champagne! The rank smell of elder leaves or the gone-over flowers is known to repel many who come across it, often being described as a cat urine smell!  After a short but sweet period in full bloom, the flowers give rise to upstanding clusters of small berries, which are typically no bigger than 10mm in diameter. Initially green, the berries gradually begin to nod earthwards as they ripen. At the end of the summer they are dark purple – with many medicinal uses. Parts used Flowers, berries, leaves, bark, fungi. Harvest time The flowers are picked when in full bloom. The berries are picked when ripe in the autumn. Key active medicinal constituents Tannins, potassium, mucilage, phenols, triterpenes, sterols, lectins, flavonoids (including rutin). The dark coloured berries are rich in anthocyanins, folic acid and vitamins A and C. They also contain flavonoids, and cyanidin glucosides, which are poisonous in large doses.  Medicinal actions Diaphoretic, febrifuge, anti-catarrhal, anti viral, immuno-supportive. Uses – Elderflowers and berries are expectorant and diaphoretic, thus they help to manage and reduce fevers and to rid the body of toxins. – Elderflowers are also anti-viral and are useful in combating herpes simplex type 1 virus (responsible for cold sores). – The flowers can be made into champagne, cordials, wine, sorbet, jam and fritters. – Elderberry extract has been proven to inhibit various strains of flu, especially if taken early enough. Many people can testify that elder can significantly reduce recovery times from influenza. – Some books have stated the ripe berries are poisonous, but this is slightly misleading. They will cause gastric upset if you eat a large quantity raw, (as will too many apples while scrumping) but in small amounts they should present no problem. Cooked into jams, syrups etc., larger quantities of elderberries are absolutely fine. – Pioneering contemporary forager-chefs have rediscovered that even the green berries can be used, as ‘capers’, if prepared correctly. This involves fermenting the berries in a salt brine solution for a few days, similar to preparing green walnuts for pickling, and then covering in a flavoured vinegar. – Even when the tree is dormant in the winter, it is still possible to harvest food! The ‘Jelly ear’ fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is often found on elder, dead or alive. Known as a delicacy in China, it is best cooked sliced into thin strips, in a spicy, oriental-style soup.

"There’s a plethora of info out there about comfrey but not much detail regarding establishing and managing a comfrey patch so I thought I would write an article to share my experience on this and how we grow comfrey as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden. A member of the borage family, comfrey – Symphytum spp. is native to Europe and Asia and there are 40 recorded species throughout that region. The plant most commonly referred to and used in gardens is Russian comfrey – Symphytum x uplandicum, a naturally occurring hybrid of two wild species: common comfrey – Symphytum officinale and prickly comfrey – Symphytum asperum. A few centuries back, the hybrid Symphytum x uplandicum came to the attention of Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) and he widely promoted the plant as a food and forage crop. Years later, and after two world wars, Lawrence D Hills (1911-1991) would continue Henry Doubleday’s Comfrey crusade. In the 1950s, Hills developed a comfrey research program in the village of Bocking, near Braintree in the UK. The original trial site is on the plot of land now occupied by the Doubleday Gardens housing development. Lawrence Hills lived at 20 Convent Lane just around the corner of the trial site. At this site, Hills trialed at least 21 comfrey ‘strains’, each one named after the village Bocking. Strain 14 was identified as being the most nutrient rich, non-seeding strain and ‘Bocking 14’ began its journey into gardens far and wide across the world. (Learn more its history on the Balkan Ecology Project blog.) Medicinal – Comfrey has been cultivated as a healing herb since at least 400BC. The Greeks and Romans commonly used comfrey to stop heavy bleeding, treat bronchial problems and heal wounds and broken bones. Poultices were made for external wounds and tea was consumed for internal ailments. Comfrey has been reported to promote healthy skin with its mucilage content that moisturizes and soothes and promotes cell proliferation. This plant is my first port of call if ever I need to dress a wound. Simply take a few leaves brush them together to remove the hairs and wrap them around the wound and apply light pressure. It’s incredibly effective at stopping the bleeding, reducing the pain and healing the wound. Biomas – Comfrey produces large amounts of foliage from late May (late spring) until hard frosts in October or November (late autumn). The plant is excellent for producing mulch and can be cut from 2-5 times per year depending on how well the plants are watered and fed. The plant grows rapidly after each harvest. In our gardens we have Comfrey ‘Bocking 14’ located next to each fruit tree in order to have a renewable source of mulch just where we need it. We also grow in patches as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden and have patches in the wildflower meadows (details below). We’ve supplied 1,000 ‘Bocking 14’ cuttings to Oxygenisis, a business in Germany who are experimenting with using this plant for carbon capture. Mineral dam – Comfrey has deep roots of up to 2m that utilize nutrients deep in the subsoil that would otherwise wash away with the underground soil water or remain inaccessible to other plants. The nutrients, once taken up from the roots, are relocated throughout the plant as and where needed with some of them ending up in the comfrey leaf mass. When cutting the leaf mass and applying to the soil surface, the mined nutrients are returned and again made accessible to shallower rooted crop plants.  Biodiversity – The bell shaped flowers provide nectar and pollen to many species of bees and other insects from late May until the first frosts in late autumn. Lacewings are said to lay eggs on comfrey and spiders overwinter on the plant. Parasitoid wasps and spiders will hunt on and around comfrey. Pest and disease prevention and control – Research indicates that a comfrey solution can be used to prevent powdery mildew. Pest predators such as spiders, lacewings and parasatoid wasps associate with this plant. It’s best to leave some plants alone in order to sustain pest predator relationships. Ground cover – Some species can quickly spread to form a thick ground cover and work particularly well for ground cover on the sunny side under shrubs and trees. Symphytum tuberosum – Tuberous Comfrey seems to be the best species for this.  Fertilizer – Comfrey leaves contain a great balance of major plant nutrients (N,P,K) and can be fed to plants as powder, direct mulch or by steeping chopped comfrey leaves in water for several weeks to produce a thick, dark liquid that can be diluted with water and applied to plant roots. More on this below. Nutritional value of comfrey – You can see from the below table that wilted comfrey contains significantly higher quantities of potash compared to other organic fertilizers. It’s well recorded that comfrey is an excellent source of potassium (K) a major plant nutrient that is required by plants in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction. Animal fodder – Comfrey has a long history for use as an animal feed. Lawrence D Hills dedicated books to this topic.* The leaves are best received by animals wilted. Fresh leaves can be eaten by pigs, sheep, and poultry but cattle, rabbits and horses will only consume wilted leaves. Human consumption – Symphytum officianale and Symphytum x uplandicum are both reported to be used for salad and potherb and are best when cooked. Personally I’m not keen on the texture but will have the occasional nibble from the garden using the new growth to mix in a spring green salad. Caution – Although comfrey has been used as a food crop, in the past 20 years scientific studies reported that comfrey may be carcinogenic, since it appeared to cause liver damage and cancerous tumors in rats. These reports have temporarily restricted development of comfrey as a food crop. In light of this, the regular consumption of comfrey is not advisable.  Life cycle – Herbaceous perennial Growth habit – Comfrey begins growth in early-April and by early May compact clusters of young leaves are visible in the crown of the old plant. Within a few weeks, the leaf blades with long petioles have grown to over 35cm high. Basal leaves are large, lance-shaped, stalked, and coarsely hairy. The leaves die back following the first frost and remain dormant for winter. Many species can spread vigorously via seed and are generally not welcome in the garden because of this. Other species can spread via tubers and all species quickly regenerate from broken root pieces.  Flowering – Starts in late May or early June and continues until the first frost in late autumn. The bell-shaped flowers with pedicels are in terminal cymes or one-sided clusters. Flowers of common comfrey are usually creamy yellow, but white, red, or purple types have been found in Europe. Prickly comfrey has pink and blue flowers while Russian comfrey has blue, purple, or red-purple flowers. Tuberous comfrey has creamy white flowers. Vegetative growth does not cease with the start of flowering, and the plant will add new stems continuously during the growing season. Most comfrey plants can be somewhat invasive, spreading via seed to parts of the garden where they are not wanted. ‘Bocking 14’ will flower and provide nectar and pollen but will not produce viable seed. Roots – Some species have short, thick, tuberous roots such as Symphytum tuberosum. Others such as Symphytum x uplandicum have deep and expansive root systems. Light – Needs full sun for good biomass production but grows fine in the shade. Shade – Tolerates light shade (about 50%). Moisture – Some species are drought tolerant e.g. Symphytum tuberosum. Cultivated plants require irrigation. USDA Hardiness Zone – 4-9 comfrey crowns and roots are very winter hardy.  Soil – Comfrey is adaptable to many soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils.  pH – Tolerates a wide range (6.5-8.5), although not very sensitive to soil pH, highest yields are reported to occur on soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Perhaps you’re interested in growing comfrey to feed your animals, for medicine, for mulch, for compost or you’re slightly masochistic and want to roll around naked in the pricky beds of biomass (not me). In any case, here’s how to do it. The plant we use in our gardens is Symphytum x uplandicum – ‘Bocking 14’. A sterile cultivar that produces copious quantities of nutrient dense biomass. The following information is based on using this plant.  Choosing the site – We’re growing for biomass and want the plants to receive as much light as possible. Accordingly, we lay out our beds on an east to west axis (we’re in the northern hemisphere).  Irrigation is necessary if you want to get good yields from the plants so picking a place with access to irrigation is of paramount important.  In areas of low rainfall, using the gradient of the land to channel precipitation towards your beds will reduce the water needs of your plants. In areas of high rainfall with a high water table you should consider diverting water away from the beds. Once established, comfrey is difficult to get rid of, so choose a site where you want it to stay. Don’t plant comfrey in any area you cultivate, as the broken root pieces quickly establish into new plants and can out compete slower growing crops.  Position comfrey downhill from where you expect leachate to be present, i.e downhill from a manure pile , compost heap, outside toilet, animal pen etc., can provide passive fertility to the plants and rescue otherwise lost minerals from draining away with the sub soil ground water. 
Grow the comfrey where you want to use it. As you’ll see later we may be harvesting over 1/4 ton biomass from our patch and don’t want to be carrying that over long distances. Preparing the site – Raised beds are a major part of our fertility strategy and overtime retain water and nutrients very efficiently. I use 1.3m wide beds surrounded by 50cm paths for our crops as this allows easy access for harvesting everywhere in the beds without ever having to tread on the soil and the paths are wise enough to take our lawnmower. To form a bed, the area should be cleared of all plants, which is best achieved by sheet mulching the season before. Pernicious perennials or tap rooted biennials should be dug out. After you have cleared the whole area, mark out the bed shape with string and dig out 50cm wide paths around your beds, applying the soil to the surface of the planting area and thereby creating the initial rise of the bed. Fork over the beds well. If a hardpan is present take the time and effort to eliminate it before planting. Depending on the quality of your soil you may want to add extra compost before planting into the bed. If you have sheet mulched the area before hand, with the additional soil from the paths all you need to do is add a good 20cm thick straw mulch (or some other mulch) and it’s ready for planting. A good mulch to start with will help keep the weeds down while your comfrey gets going. You can alter the depth and gradient of the paths to facilitate the required direction of water movement. Planting material – You can plant out with crown divisions or root cuttings best done in the spring when the soil has warmed. A crown division can be obtained from simply putting a spade through the center of a mature comfrey plant and transplanting the divided sections. For our beds, I divided two year old plants into quarters, sometimes sixths, and these established very well in the first year. It’s bests not to harvest the leaf biomass in the first year in order to allow a deep root system to develop. However if you use large divisions you can start harvesting in July. Root cuttings are a great way to plant out large areas of comfrey. The cuttings should be grown on in small pots with 50% compost 50% river sand mix kept moist and planted out in the spring as soon as the first leaves emerge and the soil has warmed. If you are planting large numbers of root cuttings you can plant directly into the beds by creating ‘nests’ in the straw, adding two cupped handfuls of the above mentioned potting mix and plant the cuttings into this. Keep them moist like a wrung out sponge and the success rate will be very close to 100%. Spacing – The plants should be spaced 60cm apart in rows and 60cm apart at diagonals between rows. Plant the rows 15cm from the edge of the beds. Cutting – In the first year allow the plants to establish so that the roots develop well and penetrate deep into the subsoil. Remove any weeds around the plants leaving them on the surface. The following year the cutting can begin. You can scythe the beds for a quick harvest or cut each plant individually with a pair of secateurs or shears cutting to 5cm or so from ground level. The leaves are prickly so if you have sensitive hands wear gloves. Cut the comfrey as the flowering stalks emerge up to four times a year. Allow the plants to flower at least once during the season to provide bee fodder to a range of native bees and honey bees. Leave the last flush of leaves before the winter so that invertebrates can find winter shelter in the undergrowth. You may need to weed between cuts every now and then but generally the comfrey will quickly cover the surface. Feeding – After you have cut the comfrey, mow the pathways between the beds and empty the trimmings to the base of the comfrey plants. Any trimmings from lawns and hedges in the surrounding area can also be used. We are experimenting with growing nitrogen fixing hedging and ground cover plants adjacent to the patch in order to feed our comfrey. A most excellent comfrey feed is undiluted urine applied at a rate of approx 500 ml per plant twice per growing season. Irrigation – Comfrey will produce more biomass if irrigated and in dry climates it’s essential to irrigate. Comfrey plants wilt very fast in hot conditions and will stop photosynthesising at this point. Twenty litres per m2 per week of drought should be more than adequate. The beauty of biological systems are that, if managed properly, each year the soils improve and the ability of the soil to store water will improve over time. We use passive irrigation diverting water from a mountain stream into the paths around the beds. The paths fill with water, we raise the level by blocking the low points with sacks of sawdust and the water is drawn throughout the soil via capillary action. Passive irrigation in our market garden. The paths fill with water and the water permeates throughout the soil via capillary action. As mulch – Freshly cut comfrey leaves make good mulch because they have high nitrogen content, and don’t pull nitrogen from the soil while decomposing. Comfrey’s high potassium content makes it especially beneficial for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, berries, and fruit trees. With adequate feed and watering we’ve seen yields of 2-3kg of biomass per plant per cut. Comfrey beds establishing well. This bed was planted with divided crowns 5 months prior to this photo being taken. Liquid fertliser – What I like to call ‘Comfert’. Fill a barrel, preferably with a bottom tap and a gauze on the inside (to prevent clogging) about 3/4 full with freshly cut comfrey and add water to fill the barrel. Cover it, and let it steep for 3-6 weeks. The smell from the resulting liquid is far from attractive so approach with caution. The tea may be used full strength or diluted by half or more. Don’t apply before heavy rain is forecast as most of the nutrients suspended in the liquid will wash straight through the soil. For the best results apply the feed to your vegetables when they are in most need of the extra fertility. This will be different for each crop, for example, tomatoes are best fed when they are setting fruit and then any time during the fruiting period. Applying comfert before this can be counter productive and make your plants more susceptible to pest problems. The black slurry at the bottom of the barrel can be dispersed evenly back over the comfrey patch. Liquid fertilizer concentrate – ‘Comfert Plus’ can also be made by packing fresh-cut comfrey tops into an old bucket, weighing them down with something heavy, covering tightly, and waiting a few weeks for them to decompose into a black slurry. You can put a hole in the bottom of the bucket and collect the concentrate in another container as it drips out. Dilute this comfrey concentrate about 15 to 1 with water, and use as you would comfert. You can seal this concentrate in plastic jugs until you are ready to use it. Warning! Comfert stinks like hell. My nieces came to visit from London last year and offered to help out in the market garden. One of the tasks that day was to apply comfert to the crops. Let’s just say it did not end well and we had a much better experience taking softwood cuttings the next day. According to Martin Crawford in Creating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops, one cut of comfrey from one plant contains 0.5g of Nitrogen (N) and 10g of potassium (K) to crops. Based on this I calculated how much Potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and biomass the 13 m2 comfrey patch can potentially produce in a year. Below is a table indicating how many comfrey cuts are needed to meet the Nitrogen and Potassium needs of various moderate and heavy cropping fruit and nut trees and annual vegetables. In the 1960s, Lawrence D. Hills used UK gardeners records for a comfrey report. (See the Balkan Ecology Project blog for the results.) Based on these records I calculated a yield of approx. 5.5kg of biomass per plant each year. Using this figure one of our beds should produce approx 286kg of biomass. We shall see as this year we begin our own records. We’re looking to gather some solid data on how comfrey performs in our climate and we’ll be recording the yields from our patch starting this season and for at least the next five years. For more info on our record keeping and research programs see Polyculture Market Garden Study. If you would like to join the ‘who can grow the most comfrey’ experiment and contribute data to our records, send us an email. It will be great to have records from all over the world.

"Hugelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, means hill culture or hill mound. Instead of putting branches, leaves and grass clippings in bags by the curbside for the bin men… build a hugel bed. Simply mound logs, branches, leaves, grass clippings, straw, cardboard, petroleum-free newspaper, manure, compost or whatever other biomass you have available, top with soil and plant your veggies. The advantages of a hugel bed are many, including: The gradual decay of wood is a consistent source of long-term nutrients for the plants. A large bed might give out a constant supply of nutrients for 20 years (or even longer if you use only hardwoods). The composting wood also generates heat which should extend the growing season. Soil aeration increases as those branches and logs break down… meaning the bed will be no till, long term. The logs and branches act like a sponge. Rainwater is stored and then released during drier times. Actually you may never need to water your hugel bed again after the first year (except during long term droughts). Sequester carbon into the soil. On a sod lawn Sepp Holzer (hugelkultur expert) recommends cutting out the sod, digging a one foot deep trench and filling the trench with logs and branches. Then cover the logs with the upside down turf. On top of the turf add grass clippings, seaweed, compost, aged manure, straw, green leaves, mulch, etc…  Sepp Holzer recommends steep hugel beds to avoid compaction from increased pressure over time. Steep beds mean more surface area in your garden for plants and the height makes easy harvesting. The greater the mass, the greater the water-retention benefits. Hugel bed dug in clay with logs put in vertically, next branches and lots of wood chips. Top 6 inches will be wood chips and dirt. This bed will store water and give nutrients for many years to come. Straw bale gardens require less soil, less water and hold heat. As the straw breaks down nutrients feed the plants. Combining a straw surround with a hugel interior, topped by lasagne layering is an excellent idea for an area with poor quality soil. Hugel bed in Ontario, Canada (June 28th) by Tim Burrows. Tim surrounded his very tall hugel bed in pallets! Sheet mulching (lasagne gardening) is like composting in place. Above: just a suggestion as to sheet mulching layers. Nitrogen-rich material such as fresh grass clippings or green leaves put right on the hugelkultur wood would help jump start the composting process. Could also include seaweed, straw, dead leaves, leaf mould, etc.

The first year of break down means the wood (and fungi) steal a lot of the nitrogen out of the surrounding environment, so adding nitrogen during the first year or planting crops that add nitrogen to the soil (like legumes) or planting species with minimal nitrogen requirements is necessary, unless there is plenty of organic material on top of the wood. After the wood absorbs nitrogen to its fill, the wood will start to break down and start to give nitrogen back in the process. In the end you will be left with a beautiful bed of nutrient rich soil. Tree types that work well in hugelkultur:
Hardwoods break down slowly and therefore your hugel bed will last longer, hold water for more years and add nutrients for more years. But softwoods are acceptable as well, a softwood bed will just disintegrate quicker. Mixing woods with softwoods and branches on top, to give off nutrients first, and hardwoods on bottom, sounds like a plan if you have access to multiple types of wood. Yet the newly decomposing softwoods at the top will eat up a lot of nitrogen at first, so compensate for that.

Woods that work best:
Alders, apple, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, oak, poplar, willow (make sure it is dead or it will sprout).

Trees types that work okay:
Black cherry (use only rotted), camphor wood (well aged), cedar/juniper/yew (anti-microbial/anti-fungal, so use only at very bottom or unless already well-aged. Cedar should be broken down before new plant roots reach it), eucalyptus (slightly anti-microbial), osage orange (exceptionally resistant to decay), Pacific yew (exceptionally resistant to decay), pine/fir/spruce (tannins and sap), red mulberry (exceptionally resistant to decay).

Tree types to avoid:
Black locust (will not decompose), black walnut (juglone toxin), old growth redwood (heartwood will not decompose and redwood compost can prevent seed germination).

"Thistles are a bane of picnickers and campers. Who hasn’t trodden on the sharp, unforgiving spines of a thistle when out and about barefoot in grasslands? For many people, relationships with thistles have generally been painful and irritable, but now you can get your own back! One of the great things about thistles is that every single species is edible, so this is great news for foraging beginners! Even the closest lookalikes found here are edible – the sow thistles (Sonchus spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), so when working with the thistles, you can learn to identify and proceed to experiment with complete confidence from the outset. We have at least 14 species of thistle growing wild in the UK, mostly from the Cirsium (aka plume thistles) and Carduus genera. Thistles are found in numerous settings all over our islands and can be a useful soil barometer. Often their presence signifies that the land is fertile, and in many instances, neglected. I eat from a number of different species. These are: creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis), spear thistle (C. vulgare), woolly thistle (C. eriophorum), marsh thistle (C. palustris), and welted thistle (Carduus acanthoides syn C. crispus). As you will discover, plants that have spines to offer protection against predators, have no real need for bitterness. Spear thistle It’s almost impossible to misidentify a thistle. One of the easy-to-spot botanical differences between thistles and their numerous relatives in the daisy family, is that the overlapping bracts (involucre) found directly below the flowers of thistles, are always spiny. Simple! The leaves of the numerous species will differ in size, shape and the density of spine coverage. Most have stiff spines on the margins, but some have soft prickles. You need to discover for yourself which are the more tactile! When in flower, most thistles produce a lovely purple / mauve bloom, but some species are known for their yellow inflorescence (cabbage thistle – Cirsium oleraceum and the Carline thistle – Carlina vulgaris). In all of the thistles, flowers give way to copious amounts of fluffy hairs (pappus) attached to their tiny fruits, superbly designed for air-borne dispersal. A distinguishing feature between the two main generais that Cirsium spp. produce feathered pappus hairs, whereas Carduus spp. only have simple pappus hairs. Creeping thistle produces dense spines on its leaves, but very few spines or hairs on the flowering stems. Spear thistle has large, deeply-lobed leaves with large spines at the margins, as well as hairy, spiny stems. Marsh thistle looks somewhat like spear thistle at an initial glance, but without the large spines and leaf lobes, and usually with a thin, red, leaf margin. Woolly thistle is easily identifiable with large, deeply-lobed, evenly-shaped leaves, and very large flower heads, wrapped in a ‘cobweb’ of cotton-like hairs. This particular species is the largest wild thistle I use, although if you have milk thistle (Silybum marianum) growing in your plot, you can use that too, but you will need good gloves to protect yourself from its long spiny flower heads! Eating milk thistle chokes would of course prevent you harvesting the exceptional liver-supportive medicine found in the seeds. Wooly thistle Creeping thistle will grow in all manner of waste-ground, grasslands, verges and field edges. I also see a lot of spear thistle in similar habitats, although when found in grassland, it’s not as abundant as the creeping species. The root systems explain why; spear thistle has a tap root, whereas creeping thistle grows on rhizomes. The marsh thistle, as its name alludes to, likes damp conditions such as fens, marshes, canal tow-paths and riversides. Woolly thistle is a little bit more selective in its choice of soil and setting, preferring calcareous ground. It too enjoys grasslands. Welted thistle can be found all over the UK, especially loving clay soils. Go prepared! Stiff gloves and a knife are required. Harvest the best leaf mid-ribs in spring when growth is plentiful and quick. Your specimens will be tender and sweeter. Flowering stems will appear from late spring through into autumn. I only consider harvesting from plants whose flower buds are yet to really begin unfurling. Flower buds (chokes) are available all summer. In Portugal, a number of thistle species are still collected in spring and sold at markets. A recent academic study highlighted the nutritional value from eating thistles. The findings are contained within ‘Ethnobotany In The New Europe’ by Manuel. P de Santayana et al. (Eds), published June 2010. In the study, researchers noted the wide range of thistle species collected, and concentrated on the nutritional value of one particular thistle (Scolymus hispanicus – Spanish or golden thistle). This plant is collected by villagers in various areas of the countryside. Bunches of the stripped leaf mid-ribs are sold and bought in a number of markets in different areas. Levels of certain nutrients were analysed and compared to some commonly consumed vegetables. Their findings show that the thistle contained consistently higher levels of important major nutrients than some of our commonly consumed cultivated vegetables. Weight for weight, thistles come out higher in fibre, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc and other nutrients. Is it likely that the thistles found wild here will be similarly endowed with a range of important vitamins and minerals? I’m more than happy to work on the assumption that this will be the case. Many other wild plant species are known to contain high concentrations of important nutrients. Preparing thistles is pretty easy. Simply choose the most tender specimens. If using the petioles, then cut and strip all the spines off, before peeling the outer, fibrous layer from the stalk. Use raw as crudités, pickle or ferment them, or chop into salads and serve them with a tangy vinaigrette. If cooking, they don’t require long! Preparing the stems is similar, but they are hollow. These can be used in similar ways to the petioles, or you can stuff them, roast them, and braise them. As relatives of the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), thistles produce edible, if smaller, ‘chokes’. These are the crunchy, immature bases, or capitulum, of the composite flower-head. As you would do with globe artichokes, peel away the bracts to get to the prize. I only choose the largest wild species for this. Happy foraging!

"Some plants seem to be our constant companions, no matter where we live. Often, they will also be some of our really useful species. It will soon become clear that the common mallow (Malva sylvestris) is one of these plants. Rather than being looked upon as a weed, the mallows can be more usefully described as some of our gloriously abundant plant helpers. A number of mallow species have long been used as a food and medicine, wherever they are found native, and especially in the Middle East and Asia. You won’t have far to go to find the common mallow in most parts of Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia either. Common mallow can be found growing erect or prostrate, which may initially cause confusion because it’s easy to assume they might be two different species. Mallow’s kidney-shaped or palmately-lobed leaves are notably creased, typically with dentate margins. The leaves often show a purple spot in the centre of the base of the leaf and this can also be seen to run down the petiole on some specimens. On other specimens, the purple spotting and colouring is completely absent. Mallow leaves have long petioles. Their deep green foliage hints at a renowned drought tolerance. During flowering, the leaves appear alternately on the stems. Holding a leaf relays the surface coarseness. But tear and crush one, and you discover a family pattern – the mucilage. You will soon experience a slimy and tacky feel between your fingers. All parts of the plant contain mucilage. In bloom, the Malvaceae family plants produce five large notched petals in each open flower. Common mallow has showy pink petals laced with darker-coloured strokes. In the centre of the flower lies a pollen-loaded column of fused stamens. This surrounds the stigma, which rises above the column.  Mallow is known to freely seed. The round seed pods, known as ‘cheeses’, soon follow flowering. These were once munched by children on their way to and from school. The pods are held on stalks, close to the flowering stem. Mallow will be found on most soils, from coastal to marginally upland habitats, with most settings being adequate for this resilient plant. It loves waste-ground as well as grassland; gravel as much as coastal edges, and waysides and roadsides as well as hedges.  Leaves, flowers, seed pods, roots. Leaves, in spring; flowers from late spring; seed pods from early summer. Roots could be harvested from larger rosettes whenever large enough. Medicinal and nutritional constituents Vitamins A,B,C,E; inulin; mucilage; phenols; flavonoids; essential fatty acids; fibre; calcium; magnesium; zinc; selenium; potassium. Traditional and contemporary uses As with many wild food plants, the common mallow has also had a long history of medicinal use. Due to its high mucilage content, mallows make excellent soothing demulcent herbs, especially for cases of inflammation, either for the urinary, digestive or respiratory systems. Pregnant women or new mothers may like to know that mallow leaves can provide useful amounts of iron, as well as being quite high in zinc and most vitamins.  All of the mallow family with exception to the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum), are reportedly edible. With their high mucilage content, the leaves can usefully be taken as an emergency antidote to irritation or burning that may be caused by the accidental consumption of acrid plants in the buttercup family. Creative cooks can substitute mallow for spinach in many dishes, including soups, salads, gnocchi and quiche. I have even flash-fried larger mallow leaves for just one second in hot oil to make ‘popadoms’. Mallow also makes a great addition to soups, whereby the mucilage helps to thicken them.  In Jewish culture, mallow has been been considered the ‘most important plant in local gather society’. Every spring mallow is gathered in the countryside. Its common name in both Hebrew and Arabic, translates to ‘bread’.  During the war of 1948, when Jerusalem was under siege, mallow was an important famine crop, and one that is still celebrated on Independence day every year with a traditional dish made from mallow leaves. Common mallow can be substituted for the family relative Corchorus olitorius aka ‘jutes mallow’, when making the Egyptian / Middle-Eastern dish ‘Molokhia’. This traditional dish is usually served with chicken.  In China, mallow roots are a popular and a common ingredient in making hearty, yet medicinally potent soups and broths. The inulin-rich tap roots of a number of different mallow species, including common mallow, have been used. The seed pods can be substituted for most of the egg white if wanting to make mallow meringues. Simply boil up the peeled seed pods using 3 parts water 1 part seed pods, and reduce the liquid by half. For every half cup of liquid add one egg white, ¼ tsp of cream of tartar, some vanilla and castor sugar, then whip it up until foamy and stiff, just like meringues.  21st Century Foraging  The Medicinal Forest Garden  The Fast Wild Food Cookbookby Johnny Jumbalaya  Amazing Moringa: Medicinal, Edible & Easy to Grow  How to Make your own Sloe Gin Chris Hope, aka Chris Phyto, was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic plant lover, forager and teacher, who sadly died in 2021.";Permaculture Magazine UK
"This hearty lasagne is delicious cold with salad the next day, if there is any left. 600g (21 oz) aubergines 
500g (17.5 oz/3.5 cups) onions, diced
3 cloves garlic
2 stalks celery, diced
600g (21 oz) courgettes 
1 red pepper, diced
100g (3.5 oz/2 cups) spinach or chard, chopped
Olive oil
800g (28 oz/5 ⅓ cup) tomatoes, chopped
Plus 2 or 3 tomatoes, sliced, to decorate
240g (8.5 oz/1.5 cups) cooked beans
(400g tin, drained)
1-2 tbsp chopped herbs – basil, parsley or oregano (or a mixture of all three)
Salt and pepper to taste For the garlic bread
A crusty loaf of bread 
4-10 cloves garlic (I like it strong!)
0.5-1 cup olive oil (it depends how large the loaf is)
Pepper
An oven dish approximately 25 x 25cm (10 x 10in) Preheat the oven to 180oC fan (200oC/400oF/gas mark 6). Finely chop the garlic and mix into the olive oil. Add a little pepper, stir and leave to infuse. Slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways into 5mm thick slices. Pour some olive oil into the pan and soften the onions, garlic and celery on a low heat.  When cooked, add the red pepper, beans and tomatoes. Simmer for around 15 minutes until the sauce is cooked through. Meanwhile, drizzle olive oil onto a griddle and cook the aubergines and courgettes, several slices at a time, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Pour some of the tomato sauce into the oven dish, add a layer of aubergine, then more sauce, a layer of courgette, and so on until the dish is filled with layers of sauce, aubergine and courgette. Decorate with slices of tomato. Put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Slice the bread so the knife goes about 90% through the loaf, leaving the base intact and the slices attached to each other. Put in a baking dish and, using a spoon, drizzle the garlic oil over both sides of each slice.  15 minutes before the lasagne is ready, put the bread in the oven. When the lasagne is cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the crusty garlic bread and a large salad, or dish of steamed seasonal green vegetables. Tip – Frying pan will work if you don’t have a griddle. This recipe adapts well to other vegetables. In the winter, use slices of cooked potato, parsnip, sweet potato or squash. Cooked whole cabbage and kale leaves make lovely ‘lasagne sheets’ too.  The Creative Kitchenby Stephanie Hafferty  No Dig Organic Home and Gardenby Stephanie Hafferty and Charles Dowding  Seasonal Pesto and Hummus Recipes  Growing Winter Salads Stephanie Hafferty is a no dig gardener, writer and author of The Creative Kitchen and coauthor of No Dig Organic Home and Garden.";Permaculture Magazine UK
"My name is Suzanne Pendleton and I live in Swinton, Salford (UK) and have been involved in the Greater Manchester Swift Street initiative since August 2024, which has been led by the RSPB. During lockdown I started to value my time outside as so many families did too. I enjoyed time in our little garden more and spotted some birds as they zoomed and screamed over the house. I wasn’t quite sure what they were and asked my friend Kathleen who lived on a surrounding road what they might be. She enlightened me. They were Swifts, a species recently added to the UK’s Red List of birds, meaning they are now amongst our most threatened. Then the summer was over and the swifts left Swinton heading back to Africa.  Each year since, I have eagerly anticipated the return of the Swifts. My understanding grew and I learnt of their declining numbers, now less than 60,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Along with developing a stiff neck constantly looking up to the sky, watching their incredible aerial manoeuvres.  I am privileged to live in a friendly neighbourhood on our lane. The community are always up for helping, and we pull together to help each other. We have a community messaging service which came into its own in lockdown, and continues to be a fabulous way to share information and request help and advice. During the last few years I had messaged our community group and asked if anyone knew about our Swifts and where they were nesting. Initially we were unsuccessful in understanding, but in spring 2024 we struck lucky and finally worked out the eaves where they lived. I’d also discovered Swift Mapper (an app for recording the location of Swift nesting sites) enabling us to understand we had four nest sites on the Lane and surrounding roads.  We also realised that there was another small colony locally less that 1/4 mile away. Last August, a resident of this local road got in touch to say Roshni (Parmar-Hill, Community Engagement Officer) from the RSPB had been to visit their colony. She asked if we’d be interested in getting involved with developing our Swift Street – thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery – and I eagerly accepted the offer. We used our community messaging group to share the news of the Swift Street development and I was overwhelmed by the local response. So many families were keen to help our Swift population, with more than 80 boxes requested. I think the consensus was that we are so privileged that these incredible urban birds choose our lane as their home, and as their nesting places can be threatened by redevelopment, having the opportunity to install boxes is a wonderful chance to do something proactive to help.  Roshni and I visited local homes who had expressed interest, helping families select potential sites for their boxes to be positioned. With Roshni’s guidance we talked about what Swifts need and I and residents began to understand more about how Swifts live. They are remarkably compatible with humans, don’t need a bird bath, bird table etc. as they feed on insects on the wing. I discovered along with other residents that the best way we could help our Swifts was to protect their current nesting sites, add boxes for more birds to nest in and to do all we could to support insect populations. For example, considering planting in our gardens to promote insect life, adopting No Mow May and not using insecticides. Those who weren’t able to install a box could instead help in other ways, so this made the project accessible for all – everyone could join in. Next came the production of the boxes. Roshni contacted local colleges and we were thrilled when a local skills centre suggested their joinery students could make these free of charge. Production began and numbers of those interested had grown as the message about the project spread, and so 100 boxes were produced.  Meanwhile, local guiding groups learnt of the initiative and Roshni visited the groups that I lead, as Brown Owl – 90 girls and young women were keen to learn about Swifts and how they could help. The groups were already keen to learn about environmental matters, and this project really whetted their appetite. The Brownies, Guides and Rangers designed posters, made seed bombs and grew in their understanding of our Swifts. Once the production of the boxes was finished the Brownies, Rangers and Guides got stuck into painting them with an environmentally friendly product which would protect the boxes, and a local lady Haldis (a RSPB Swift Champion, a voluntary role which supports local conservation efforts to protect the species) made the nest cups which would be inserted into each box.  We arrived at installation day on Saturday 8th March, with 25 boxes going up on that first day. By the end of March, 80 had been erected by a local roofer, Ryan. Of course, we needed to celebrate the returning of our precious Swifts and so we began planning our community event. Volunteers came forward from the surrounding roads and we met in a resident’s kitchen each Wednesday, so all could contribute ideas. Other local guiding groups wanted to contribute and so they made nature-themed bunting, and we were thrilled when the church on the lane offered their venue as a space for us to celebrate. The local dance and drama group wanted to be involved and so their leaders and young people planned songs and a drama production with poetry. And as if we weren’t already exciting enough, we then heard the news that RSPB Ambassador Megan McCubbin would love to come along to formally open our Swift Street.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on 17th May, with a fantastic community event. Sixty families made bee hotels, children had Swift-themed face paint, and a plant swap was popular. RSPB provided and led crafts, and local artists supported youngsters to make Swift puppets. More than 300 residents attended and watched the young people perform. The ribbon was cut revealing a beautiful Swift Street banner created by a local artist, alongside Swift boxes 99 and 100 positioned proudly on the front of the church. And yes, we had Swifts soaring high above us all day (perhaps watching the proceedings?) to the delight of the watching children and residents. As the street party continued into the evening we couldn’t believe our eyes when a ‘banger’ (a young Swift, which gets its name from its tendency to bang against prospective nest to check if they’re occupied or not) attempted to enter one of the newly positioned boxes. A perfect end to a fabulous day.  It’s been an absolute honour to be involved in this project and I feel so lucky that our community have been able to do something practical to support our local Swifts.

"We are delighted to announce the recipients of the 2025 Permaculture Magazine Award, in collaboration with Lush Spring Prize. Four projects have been awarded from a fund of £25,000. The Permaculture Magazine Award is a celebration of the vital work of permaculture projects from around the world. The Permaculture Magazine Award was established in 2018 to celebrate the vital work of permaculture projects around the world. To date (May 2025) it has awarded 28 projects with over £155,000. The award has received hundreds of applications, and it is a privilege to highlight this vital regenerative work that is world changing. Coordinating a network of permaculture centres, NGO Permaculture Ukraine offers training, events and educational resources across Ukraine, also ensuring accessibility for internally displaced people (IDP) and former military personnel. The organisation was founded following the first Permaculture Design Course (PDC) in Ukraine in 2011, and has held at least one PDC annually, actively seeking funding to make training accessible to vulnerable groups. Following the full-scale invasion in 2022, its focus expanded to include: The 14 permaculture centres provide training, shelter for IDPs and war-abandoned animals, and rehabilitation for children and adults. Its designers also create communal projects, including schools and homes for disabled people. Despite air raids and blackouts, NGO Permaculture Ukraine successfully hosted a two-day permaculture festival in Kyiv’s botanical garden in September 2024, drawing 100 participants eager to engage with top regenerative practitioners. NGO Permaculture Ukraine empowers Ukrainians for sustainable living and transformative change. Through active social media engagement and collaborations with ecovillages, zero-waste networks, and other ecological movements, it extends its influence and inspires a growing audience to adopt permaculture principles for Ukraine’s regeneration. https://permaculture.in.ua Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Since its founding in 2021, Battmung has: Recognising the importance of connecting people, Battmung also contributed to the founding of the Permaculture Institute of Korea (P.I.K) in 2023. Its goal is to organise its regional network and regenerate South Korea through permaculture, restoring soil, food chains, ecological awareness, and local economies. www.instagram.com/battmung.log Eco Centro Allpa Tarpuna works for the regeneration of degraded lands, food sovereignty and community autonomy, with a focus on indigenous communities in Ecuador. Founded in 2004, it was born out of the return of its founders to their community after experiencing the negative impacts of conventional agriculture and agrochemicals. This return marked the beginning of a path towards reconnecting with indigenous ancestral knowledge and adopting permaculture and organic production. One of the key achievements has been the recovery of soils degraded by monocultures and eucalyptus. Although slow, this process has demonstrated the benefits of a regenerative approach and strengthened the resilience of the community. Allpa Tarpuna is currently focusing on: Allpa Tarpuna integrates bio-construction, renewable energy and sustainable water management into its practices. It also encourages the preservation of ancestral seeds and agro-ecological techniques such as crop rotation, reducing dependence on chemicals. In the future, it wants to expand its training in permaculture design, combining indigenous knowledge with modern regenerative solutions. It seeks to empower more local farmers, promoting designs that restore the connection between people and nature. Allpa Tarpuna is a living indigenous family that sows regeneration, inspiring a sustainable and resilient balance. https://allpatarpuna.org HortaFCUL is a community-based permaculture project based in Lisbon University’s Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). The initiative was launched by a group of biology students concerned about the gap between sustainability ideals and the university’s environmental impact. This bottom-up project has developed an important role as a catalyst of practical scientific-based knowledge. Nowadays, HortaFCUL is a resilient, sustainable and inclusive community, allowing the general public to learn more about nature-based solutions. It has five subprojects at campus level and relies on a volunteer-based horizontally-organised guardians collective to maintain the project’s green areas. HortaFCUL, as a permaculture project, achieves its central goals by closing functional loops related to human activities.

"As politicians wait, grassroots changemakers are restoring ecosystems and rebuilding resilience. They are living examples that regeneration is not just possible, it’s already happening all over the world.  The Lush Spring Prize 2025 is showcasing this work and has awarded around £250,000 to 19 groups, celebrating regenerative organisations and practitioners from around the world. Lead image: Clockwise from top left: Agro-Pueblos (Colombia), Ñu’u Ndito (Mexico), Global Ecovillage Network (Global), Land in Our Names (UK) In a joyous, collaborative and inspiring week of celebrations, the 2025 recipients were honoured as part of a celebratory event held in Dorset (UK), where the Lush Cosmetics company is headquartered. The event was attended by prize recipients, Spring Prize judges, Lush staff, press, funders and other regenerative practitioners. Co-designed with the prize recipients themselves, the event provides a space to connect, co-learn and share stories of regeneration. It offered an opportunity to explore both the diversity of people and organisations that make up the regenerative movement and the common challenges, learnings and successes that unites it. Each Spring Prize year sees different themes emerge that are shaped by the organisations that receive a prize. In 2025, these include the importance of weaving ancestral wisdom with scientific approaches; working at multiple scales and legally recognising the rights of nature, and learning from those on the frontlines that are facilitating regenerative work in conflict zones or regions experiencing natural disasters. In 2025, the backdrop of violence and conflict looms large. Prize recipients from Lebanon and Ukraine are responding to invasions by powerful aggressors, in Myanmar they are working in a context of ongoing internal conflict and many of the Indigenous groups are frequently facing the threat of violence.  The Spring Prize 2025 event allows these groups to come together and share what regenerative work in these situations looks like in a way that may challenge the existing narrative: “In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the biggest achievement for our organisation is to continue our activities and find ways to be useful for Ukrainian society like creating permaculture public spaces and rehabilitating people in our demonstration centers. The war has taught us that strength is in unity and networks, that autonomous homesteads and farms that grow their own food and preserve their seeds can not only survive but also help other people, and that international support and networks matter.” NGO Permaculture in Ukraine While humanity witnesses declining biodiversity, climate catastrophes and widespread conflict, these organisations highlight how regenerative practices are not just a source of hope but a necessary and much needed response.

Examples of this year’s awarded projects include: Aguaje palm tree seedlings were distributed among Kukama families in Parinari, Loreto, Peru, as part of the reforestation and conservation initiative led by Huaynakana. Extractivism represents a constant threat to the Kukama territory in Peru and the loss of the Kukama peoples’ cultural identity. Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana exists to protect this. The Kukama people conceive of the territory as a whole and women having an intrinsic connection to it. The term ‘kukama’ for example is composed of two words: ‘ku’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘kama’ meaning ‘bosom,’ and it signifies ‘field-bosom’ or ‘nourished by the field.’ Given the Kukama peoples’ lives are reliant on the forest ecosystems of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and considering how they have adapted and coexisted with them for decades, the territory and the rivers are inseparable from their culture and way of life. They consider the rivers to be living beings with spirits, and therefore sacred. Founded in 2001, Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana embarked on a long journey of collective actions, protests, and mobilisations in pursuit of environmental justice as the river’s health declined as a result of extractive industries. In September 2021 Huaynakana filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognise the Marañón River as a living being and subject of rights. In March 2024, the provincial court of Nauta ruled that the Marañón River has intrinsic rights, including the right to flow, to be free from pollution, and to be restored to environmental health. This decision also recognised Indigenous communities as the river’s legal representatives, defenders, and guardians. This landmark ruling was ratified by the higher court last November. Huaynakana plays a key role in defending the Marañón’s rights and supporting the regeneration and conservation of the waterways through reforestation efforts because without the river, these unique forests cannot exist. Mushrooms harvested from the Ubuntu food forest Ubuntu Learning Hub Trust was set up in 2022 with a mission to support people who are in transition towards more resilient futures and a healthier planet. The Trust immediately began to set up the Ubuntu Learning Centre as an open learning space for all ages as well as a demonstration centre for integrating technologies that are in tune with a healthy Mother Earth. The learning centre sits on a two-hectare site in Chikancila village in Chongwe district of Lusaka Province of Zambia. It is founded on the African philosophy of Ubuntu which helps people to learn what it means to be truly human. It hosts people from all walks of life who are looking for pathways to escape the rat race and curve more sustainable futures for themselves, their families and the communities where they come from. The Trust uses agro-ecological practices to regenerate the degraded farmland that was damaged over decades of poor land husbandry. For example, the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) technique has helped to restore much of the indigenous vegetation on the land. People come to Ubuntu to explore the meaning of life and to find their life purpose. They stay at Ubuntu for varying lengths of time and in the process they are engaged in intercultural exchanges as well as learning how to take care of themselves and of Mother Earth. The Trust offers life changing experiences rather than certificates and the opportunity to carve out an earth-centred worldview for themselves.

Harvesting with Battmung friends The LUSH Spring Prize is a joint venture between LUSH Cosmetics and Ethical Consumer and is now in its sixth prize cycle, having started in 2017. The Spring Prize has distributed more than £1.3 million to regenerative projects worldwide. The LUSH Spring Prize was set up to support ‘regenerative’ projects – those that go beyond sustainability by taking holistic approaches to building the health of ecology, economy and social systems. It seeks to support those who are leaving the world lusher than they found it, and are actively restoring all the systems they are part of. By supporting regenerative projects the Spring Prize hopes to raise the profile of the movement as a whole to inspire more individuals, groups, communities, funders, media platforms and businesses to start engaging with regenerative processes.  The Spring Prize judging panels are made up of people drawn from a diverse range of movements that represent regenerative design, permaculture, food sovereignty, transition towns, biomimicry, eco-village networks and various social justice movements. Each prize cycle a ‘Lush Customer Judge’ and ‘Lush Staff Judge’ are also selected to act as additional independent members of the judging panel.  The collaborative prizes have separate panels, which also include judges from the main Spring Prize panel. The majority of the judging panel for the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Award self identify as Indigenous themselves, some being previous recipients of the award. The judges are not just involved in choosing the recipients but are involved in shaping the prize as a whole, attending the event and connecting with prize recipients.

"Around 40 years ago, the Sahel, an extremely arid region located in central Africa, was an area of agricultural desolation. Due to natural factors such as heavy drought and interannual variability, combined with anthropocentric influences like climate change, overgrazing and deforestation, the environment has become particularly unstable with little possibility for productivity.  Furthermore, when rain does fall in the arid region, the soil is so dry due to a lack of precipitation, that water immediately ‘runs off’ or evaporates, failing to soak into the depleted earth. Some countries within the region, such as Burkina Faso, faced up to 24% of their arable lands classed as highly degraded in 1998 (Maatman et al., 1998).  In the early 2000s, NGOs and organisations such as the United Nations, the World Food Programme and WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), amongst others, sought to reverse the desertification of many parts of Africa, including the Sahel, in cooperation with farmers and communities from the affected regions. Using the ancient ‘half moon’ water harvesting technique – used for centuries in Africa and the Middle East, the revitalised technique aims to facilitate water retention and re-green the ecosystem. Heavy machinery or hand tools can be used to plough the soil roughly 30cm down in a semi-circle or ‘half moon’ shape. The diameter of these half moons are typically about 4 metres. When it rains, the contours catch the rainwater, preventing runoff and allowing it to infiltrate the soil. This creates ‘favourable micro-climate conditions’ allowing drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet to be planted.  If planted on steep slopes, half-moon ‘bunds’ can assist the growth of tree species. They can also be used in combination with controlled grazing to boost re-vegetation. In Niger, The World Food Programme (WFP) has been implementing half-moon planting projects since 2014. Just 5 years into the scheme, the benefits of its implementation were examined by a progress-review. In 2019, over 400 households had restored approximately 3,000 acres of land, largely for use in producing food for livestock. This has promoted social cohesion and economic growth by providing more jobs and stabilising agricultural output in a formerly capricious climate. This scenario exhibits the benefits of a localised, small-scale regenerative farming technique such as half-moon planting through its trickle-down effects, stipulating broader socio-economic growth. A study on the impact of reformed agroecological techniques was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Burkina Faso. Figures revealed that fields ploughed using the half-moon method saw the rates of increase for grain yield at 8% (The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 2017). As farmers sought new ways to boost crop yields, regenerative farming techniques such as the half-moon method were found to be successful when used in conjunction with others. In Burkina Faso, half-moon planting is exercised alongside the Zaï technique, which is useful when adapting to various soil types and structures. The Zaï method, suitable to the arid Sahel region, uses similar methods seen in the half-moons, but alternatively involves digging smaller pits in non-permeable soil to intercept water and gather compost material. These pits are slightly smaller than the half-moons and so are less labour intensive and can be utilised in smaller growing plots. They are roughly between 15-50cm across; 5-15cm deep; and positioned 80cm apart. This technique was reintroduced to the area in the 1980s by farmer and agronomist Yacouba Sawadogo, who pioneered the method of filling the holes with manure to further break up the earth and bolster soil productivity.

"Traditional Māori time systems were measured in accordance to the night as opposed to the Western proxy of daylight. Each night of the lunar month had a particular name and this cumulatively formed a lunar calendar known as ‘Maramataka‘. Farming according to the Maramataka lunar calendar is used in conjunction with Māori regenerative farming techniques to adapt to nature’s schedule as opposed to imposing controls on the earth’s processes. Many farmers are now seeking to turn back to these ancient methods in line with broader sustainability imperatives. Under the Maramataka calendar, individual lunar nights were marked according to how optimal they were for catching fish, eels or planting crops, with each night having its own name. A good example is eel fishing. It is not productive on a full moon – Rākaunui – because the moon’s light would not allow eel to hunt their prey, as the prey could see them. As with biodynamics (the Rudolf Steiner lunar approach for farming), planting crops is nest at a full moon, when the gravitational pull is at its highest, because it has maximum influence on water in the soil. “Despite the use of Maramataka being limited to a relative few today, largely because of colonisation, interest in and revival of this knowledge and practice is growing.”1 Many farmers are returning to the use of farming tactics such as Maramataka planting in line with broader regenerative goals. The Revitalise Te Taiao programme aims to fund sustainable and lucrative agribusiness solutions to cultivate Te Taiao (the natural world). This project provided $2.7 million in funding to Miru Young and Mohi Beckham, farmers based in the North Island’s Bay of Plenty, to trial agriculture techniques which aim to “enhance the mana and mauri of the soil” across 10 farm sites. As part of the scheme, both farmers undertook rigorous research, sowing pasture throughout different moon phases from resting and dormant phases to high-energy phases for plant growth. Soon, grass seeds sown during the high energy periods of the Maramataka calendar outgrew neighbouring crops planted in other phases, even if the latter had been sown 10 days before. Despite still being in the trial stages of Maramataka planting, Miru and Mohi observed various positive impacts of the scheme within the first few months. Their land has seen higher productivity and crop yields, with a 93% crop survival rate under Maramataka planting, that is an increase of 13% from the usual 80% under previous methods. One of the main issues associated with returning to traditional farming methods on a broader scale is competing with intensive methods in New Zealand’s modern agricultural industry. After settlers from the West arrived in New Zealand during the 18th and 19th centuries, intensive farming practices quickly became widespread.  As farming in the country has continuously expanded into the modern day, with agricultural exports making up a large proportion of the country’s GDP, traditional farming methods have become far less lucrative in the broader market. This meant that Māori farmers had to adopt newer techniques, as those trying to maintain the traditional methods were faced with far lower crop yields and income. Rural management programmes and sustainability objectives are constantly investigating new and feasible ways to rejuvenate te ao Māori farming techniques, with the Revitalise Te Taiao programme representing just one of many schemes. The Maramataka lunar calendar is part of a broader Maori worldview known as Mātauranga Māori – a term used to describe the collective knowledge of Māori living in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the knowledge passed down from their ancestors. Kaitiakitanga (stewardship/management) and the link between Whakapapa (Māori genealogy/ancestral descent) and Whenua (land) are key areas of te ao Māori and Mātauranga values.  By embracing schools of thought that are native to Aotearoa, alongside promoting equitable stewardship across modern farming methodologies, high agricultural output can be attained. Reforming the agribusiness in New Zealand will involve reintegrating Māori into decision making processes, embracing cross-cultural thought processes and utilising western technological advancements for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.

"Lammas is a celebration of the summer and the gathering in of the grain harvest. This was especially significant in the past. After all the hard work of getting the grain crop cut, threshed, stored and stacked, there came a time for feasting, celebration and assessment. Lammas is a Saxon name meaning ‘Loaf-mass’. Lughnasadh (pronounced Loo-nas-ah) is Irish Gaelic. On Lammas Eve fires were lit on Lammas mounds such as Silbury Hill at Avebury, to honour the Corn Mother as she gives birth to her harvest child, the Grain. This is the seed that will bring next year’s harvest as well as the grain that will sustain life throughout the winter. The month of August was the month of the Grain Mother. An ‘augur’ is an old word for seer and meant ‘increaser’. The great abundance of the Earth Mother is reflected in the titles she was given at this time: The Grain Mother, Barley Mother, Corn Mother, Demeter, Ceres, Cerealia, Grain, the Wise One of the Earth, the Increaser, She who is the seed, who is the womb, who is the soil, the Great Provider, the Preserver of Life. Cutting the ‘corn’ seems to be a general term for all cereal crops, whether they are wheat, barley, rye or oats. There were many customs and rituals throughout Europe to honour the first and the last sheaf of corn to be cut. The last sheaf was often cut by the youngest girl present and fashioned into a Corn Maiden. It was carried joyfully back to the village, sometimes plaited and decked with ribbons, and usually hung over the fireplace. Sometimes it was dressed in women’s clothes, and ritually burnt on the Lammas Fire. Sometimes these Corn Maidens were kept until Yule when they were divided up amongst the cattle or kept until the spring. Sometimes they were kept with the date tied to them. Many Corn Maidens would be seen hanging above the fireplace. In Scotland the ‘young maid’ was made out of the last stalks cut, and kept. The ‘old wife’ was made out of the first stalks cut and was passed on to the nearest farm that had not finished bringing in the corn. This was then passed round until it ended up at the last farm to be cut. Another old European custom was to weave the last sheaf into a large Corn Mother with a smaller corn doll inside it, representing next year’s unborn harvest. The regenerative power of the Earth is never more manifest than now as the grain harvest is gathered in and the Sun’s cycle begins to wane. The Cauldron of Regeneration was central to Celtic spiritual understanding. We are renewed by sleep and darkness, through many deaths and rebirths, and by the sacrifice of our outer lives for the inner journey. Here at Lammas, the doorway to the inner realms is opening. This is the symbolism behind the Demeter/Kore/Persephone story. Demeter, the Corn Mother, represents the ripe corn of this year’s harvest, and Kore or Persephone represents the grain-seed who lives in the dark throughout the winter and reappears in the Spring. Persephone’s descent into the Underworld is a mythical interpretation of the seed lying in the ground during the dark winter months, and her reappearance as the young maid, or the new sprouting seed, in the spring. This story shows us the Triple Goddess in all her aspects: as Earth Mother, the abundant provider; as the Crone, the wisdom found within; and as the Maiden who returns renewed in the spring. Pluto/Hades’ abduction of Persephone is a later reworking of this older myth. After all the manifest energy and activity of the early summer, it is good to make time now to rest and to assimilate all that has happened during the Sun’s active phase. Lammas celebrations would probably have begun with the cutting of the last sheaf of corn. Although the 2nd of August is the calendar date for Lammas, the great Lammas fairs and feasts would probably have lasted from mid July to mid August and would have peaked around the time of the harvest Full Moon. Once the grain had been safely gathered in and the men returned from their hunting trips, it was a time for feasting, dancing and merry-making, a great celebration of the first of the harvest and assessment of the year’s achievements. Beer, wine, cider and whisky made from the previous year’s harvest, were ritually drunk, celebrating the transformative power of Fire and Water. Cooking fires were honoured as they too embodied the power of Fire and Water. Bread was made from the new grain and thanks were given to the Sun’s life energy reborn as the bread of life. This is a busy time for harvesting herbs and collecting herb seeds to sow in the spring. Give thanks and blessings as you pick them, dry them and store them. Review what you know about them and ways you can use them both physically and metaphysically. Harvest sage at the end of July, before the flowers have come out. Sage is a herb associated with wisdom and releasing blocks in expression. It is connected to the throat chakra and is for those who have something to say but cannot let it out. It will help you express your emotions. Make the herb tea in the usual way. The infusion is a useful antiseptic herb for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers and mouth infections. It can be used as a gargle, for bathing wounds, sores, and to stop bleeding. Use the tea infusion externally and then drink afterwards as well. It will dry up excess secretions such as catarrh or sinusitis. It contains oestrogen and is useful in the menopause and for delayed menstruation. Burn dried sage to cleanse and purify. Waft the smoke around a person to cleanse their aura (called smudging). This is a good way to begin any ritual or ceremony. N.B. It must not be taken if pregnant, and because of its drying action, it must not be taken for long periods of time. It will dry up mother’s milk. Care must be taken by those who are insulin-dependent, and to be avoided by epileptics. Garlands of meadowsweet were traditionally worn for the Lammas celebrations. Its heady perfume expands the psyche, and builds inner strength. It enhances flexibility and connection to the inner levels. It is a mild sedative and painkiller containing salicylic acid (aspirin) that affects the rate at which blood clots. It is a good digestive tonic that reduces excess acidity and is useful for heartburn, hyperacidity, gastritis and peptic ulcers. As it cleanses the body of harmful acids, it is useful for any inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is a strong diuretic (increases urine) and can be used for any bladder or kidney complaint including cystitis. It reduces stagnation in the liver and therefore will help the immune system function more effectively. Its harvest time is July and August when the flowers are just beginning to open. Collect them in brown paper bags to dry for later use. N.B. Avoid if on anti-coagulant drugs. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Sacred Earth Celebrations, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"There are various methods for drying herbs for herbal recipes but they all require that the herb is dried and stored out of the light. I prefer to use brown paper bags, other people hang them up in bunches or lay them between sheets of newspaper or brown paper. • If using brown paper bags always label the bags with the name of the herb, the date and where you picked it. This is good practice and a good habit to get into as plants can change a lot in the drying process. Even if you think you will know what it is, it is surprising how you can forget, especially if you bag up several herbs over a period of a few weeks. • Leave the bags in a dry warm environment for several weeks. Put them in the airing cupboard if you have one, hang over the wood-burner or leave them on top of radiators. Shake the bags and turn the leaves over with your hands every day or two. It is essential to do this to stop any mould getting in to the herbs while they are still drying. • The herbal properties of leaves and flowers will deteriorate after 1 year so they need to be re-collected every year. Fruit, seeds, berries, roots and bark will last for 2 years. It is light that destroys the herbal properties of herbs, so at its simplest herbs can be stored all year in brown paper bags, although if they are kept in the kitchen they will need to be kept in a plastic container or airtight tin to keep them dry. Keeping the herbs in a dedicated leather or cotton bag is the traditional medicine way and these are hung somewhere warm and dry, near a radiator or fire. Putting them into dark glass jars is good in a kitchen because of the condensation. Clear jam jars are fine if they are kept in a dark cupboard. At its simplest the jar can be kept in a brown paper bag or more creative ways can be found. Herb teas vary in taste and quality. Buying popular blends as tea bags is convenient, but be aware that the herbs may be old by the time you drink them, and the herbs may have been grown in monocultures and sprayed with petrochemicals. It is infinitely better to make your own. • Making herb teas is not an exact science, especially when using the common safe plants. Interestingly, different herbalists use different amounts. I use about a teaspoonful of dried herbs or a small pile that fits into the hollow of my palm, and between a half to a pint of water, depending on the need. Use less for young children and anyone who is weak and frail. Dried herbs have twice the strength of fresh herbs, so twice the amount of fresh herb is used. • As you make the tea, say thank you to the plant. This open-hearted attitude adds to the healing process. I like to picture the plant and affirm its healing qualities as I wait for the tea to brew, partly to affirm the healing I am engaged in and also as a memory aid. This way I keep learning and understanding more about the plants all the time and keep my knowledge strong. Many of the herbs are an acquired taste. Nurture an openness to these wild flavours and earthy tastes and give them a chance. More often than not, a taste you didn’t like at first becomes a taste that you find you love. These are also for adults only as they are a mixture of brandy and honey. This makes them a most delicious way to take your medicine! They are especially good to use when travelling as they are kept in small dropper bottles and taken neat. Elixirs are combination remedies, created for specific uses and personal needs. Elixirs need to taste good so the addition of any aromatic herbs improves the flavour, but must also support the over-all herbal action. They are experimental and fun, as well as being extremely effective and I like to give them creative names. Write up everything in your Herb Journal. This is especially important when you make combination elixirs. Recording the plants and proportions used is invaluable when you create something you want to repeat. Method one 1. Half fill a dark jar with a herb or combinations of herbs: tear the leaves, crush the seeds or fruit, and chop the roots. Send your thanks to the plants. Add a little of something that will give it a nice flavour such as rose petals, sweet violet, lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena etc, making sure that their actions support the overall use of the remedy. 2. Cover the plant matter with clear runny honey and send your silent thanks to the bees. Poke well with a chopstick to get out any trapped air bubbles and break the plant matter up further. 3. Then top the jar up with brandy and 4. Put on the lid and label, date and shake well. Give it a poke and a shake frequently and keep out of bright light. They are ready in about a month, although they come to no harm if they are left longer. 5. Strain off the plant matter and rebottle in clean dark dropper bottles. Pour a little boiling water over the mash of herbs that are left over, getting every last bit of goodness out of them. Toast the plant and its medicine and have your first taste before returning the spent mash to the earth with thanks. Method two Create an instant elixir using the tinctures you have made. 1. Using a jug combine several tinctures that support the remedy you are making. 2. Mix in a similar amount of honey to tincture and mix the two together. 3. Pour into dark dropper bottles. Name and date and write up in your herb journal. Their dosage is similar to tinctures, although I tend to use them little and often. Here are some suggestions of plants to choose from, depending on what you have available. I have listed the native plants first and the aromatics at the end. Anti-stress elixir Hawthorn, cowslip, vervain, rose petals, lavender, borage. Drops of calm Hawthorn, elderflowers, cowslip, hops, valerian, vervain, rose petals, borage, lavender, chamomile. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Letting in the Wild Edges, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"Growing my own mulch has long been a goal of mine. We use a lot of mulch in the nursery and garden and at the moment I have no problem sourcing straw but if/when the day comes that the farmers start using their own straw to improve their soil (which is becoming a more common practice), I’ll be needing to step up my mulch growing efforts. Currently, I grow enough mulch to sustain my perennial beds and around 10% of my annual beds but rely on imported straw for mulching the other 90% of annual vegetable and nursery beds. My ideal mulch plant grows fast, is drought tolerant, competes minimally with crop plants, does not contain seed that easily spreads, is easy to handle and cut, i.e. not thorny/prickly or tough and fibrous, and can biodegrade relatively quickly (thereby returning the nutrients back to soil). I’ve broadly categorized the main sources of mulch we produce in our 1500m2 garden. Aquatic plants
I grow emergent wetland species such us cattails (Typha spp), sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) on the banks of a small pond (6m x 3m), and within a grey water reed bed (1m x 6m). The pond also provides suitable habitat for hornworts (Ceratophyllum spp). a submerged rootless perennial that gathers on the surface en masse. This plant makes an excellent mulch being rich in nitrogen, growing very fast and is easy to position around the base of plants. The emergent species provide a good thick carbon rich mulch that helps to reduce evaporation on the terrestrial beds and I cut these back in the spring in case they are used for overwintering invertebrates. Aquatic plants are an excellent source of mulch as there are no issues with seed germinating amongst your land based crops. Tap rooted perennial / biennials
Deep rooted perennial plants tend to produce a good amount of biomass, are generally drought tolerant and do not compete strongly with our crop plants. I have found native biennial weeds such as greater burdock (Arctium lappa), a very useful mulch plant with the gigantic leaves growing back very fast after a cut. Lesser burdock (Arctium minus), is also useful albeit to lesser extent. Although biennial, if you cut back these plants before flowering you can prolong their life, harvesting good quantities of seed free biomass. I do eventually allow some of the plants to flower and they are much loved by bees among other insects. Comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum), ‘bocking 14’, is a classic example of a deep rooted mulch plant. We have the plant scattered throughout the garden and planted in dedicated patches. The plants do require irrigation however and will only provide good leaf yields if grown on fertile soil. Peeing on the plants is recommended. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), provide a great source of biomass. For a good tuber harvest it’s best to wait until the end of the season before harvesting the mulch. We can never consume as much as we produce of these tubers in the kitchen. I have found them to be much appreciated by our pigs and an excellent source of fresh winter food for our rabbits. Leaves of greater burdock (Arctium lappa) Nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs 
These plants take a while to establish but make an excellent contribution. I’ve had good results from coppicing empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), when they are 3-years-old and chop and dropping the soft new growth three or four times a year. I am expecting to also see good results from grey alder (Alnus incana) and Italian alder (Alnus cordata). I avoid using thorny nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs for this purpose. Annual trimming of shrubs such as autumn olive – Elaeagnus umbellata and broom – Cytisus scoparius also provides good quantities of mulch. Click here for more info on nitrogen fixing plants. Lawn and ground cover
One of my favourite sources of mulch is lawn trimmings. They are great for mulching potted plants or applying a mulch into tight spots. Mixed species lawns will contain a more diverse mix of mineral nutrients. Lawns including a legume such as white clover (Trifolim repens), can provide a nitrogen rich mulch. It’s a good idea to leave some of the trimmings behind to keep the lawn healthy. Autumn leaf fall and herbaceous stem residue
The annual shedding of leaves from trees and shrubs in our garden make a great contribution to our mulch capital. Leaves can be cleared from paths, lawns and wildflower beds (as they will disrupt the growth in these areas) and concentrated where they are of benefit such as the base of high demanding fruiting shrubs such as blackcurrants or blackberries. Herbaceous perennials such as lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis) and mints (Mentha spp). will provide dead stems annually. It’s always a good idea to leave hollow stems of some herbaceous perennials to remain for the winter as they are utilized by invertebrates for egg laying and hibernating. If the plant does not have a hollow stem it can be cut back and used for mulch. Fennel (Foeniculm vulgare), provides large quantities of biomass and as far as I can tell the stems are not utilised by any organism over the winter. In the vegetable garden all the remnants of my crops after harvesting go straight back to the surface for recycling. Foeniculum vulgare and other herbaceous perennials Tree prunings
Woody prunings from shrubs, trees and vines cut into small pieces (5-10cm) make good mulch in the mature areas of the forest garden with well established fungal soils specializing in breaking down the lignified woody material. Living mulches 
In the more mature areas of the garden where the trees have established (5yrs and older) I have dispensed with mulch all together in favour of ground cover plants that can be considered living mulches. Some the most successful perennial living mulches I have found that form good dense cover in the shade include bugle (Ajuga reptans), spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), Caucasian stonecrop (Sedem spurium), perwinkle (Vinca major) and betony (Stachys officinalis). Lamium maculatum spreading well under a mullbery (Morus alba) Scaling up mulch production
In order to grow enough mulch to provide a water retaining, weed excluding barrier for my annual and nursery beds I would certainly need more space. A larger wetland area would be ideal, with aquatic species growing very fast and the seed bearing parts of the plants being non problematic to use on terrestrial beds. If you don’t have a reliable aquatic habitat, the next best option for growing quantities of mulch without irrigation and fertilization is probably grass. During my next post I’ll be sharing a plan where using the lessons garnered from small scale systems, we’ll be growing mulch to support approx 670 fruit trees and 1360 soft fruit shrubs on a 5ha Agroforestry Project (design layout below).

"There are many medicinal uses for elder – Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae family). It is an evocative tree, steeped in history, tradition, and folklore. This is one of our great food and medicinal plants, easily found in most areas of the British Isles where people have settled. It’s botanical name, Sambucus nigra, stems from the Greek word sambuke; a ‘musical pipe’, due to its hollow form supplying our ancestors a perfect wood for making pipes. The Latin ‘nigra’, means black, in allusion to the dark colour of ripe elder berry fruit. Elder is a deciduous woodland and hedgerow plant, native to Northern Europe and North America, and can be seen happily growing on most types of soil up to altitudes of approximately 470m. Superstition says to not cut elder down or burn them. This may be purely because of the toxic fumes which rise from burning elder wood, or it may be that the faeries will be really upset because you are destroying such a useful plant! Other legends have grown around this plant, such as that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who allegedly betrayed Jesus to the Romans, then said to have hanged himself from its branches. This story gave rise to the name of the edible fungus found all year round on the elder – the Jelly Ear. Elder can sometimes be found growing as a shrubby form, and sometimes like a tree on a single trunk, similar to other woodland-edge plants like hazel, hawthorn and blackthorn. A mature elder typically displays a domed crown, and will be spotted from a distance once you know it. Elders can reach 8m or more, although more commonly 5-6m or so, because of other limiting environmental factors. Ideally the plant likes a rich and damp soil in a sunny position. Elder does not like exposed sites or windy hillsides. The branches display numerous lenticels (air holes) and produce their stems with opposite pairs of buds. The buds are naked, without bud scales. The light brown, corky bark pattern on elder can appear quite similar to the invasive exotic, the ‘butterfly bush’ – Buddleja davidii. The similarity between Sambucus and Buddleja ends there. Elder’s leaves are completely different in form. They are compound, comprising of seven oval, serrated leaflets, each being about 7-10cm long. The leaflets typically come in two or three opposite pairs with one terminal leaflet. They are a much lighter green colour than the Himalayan native ‘butterfly bush’ which has a simple, lanceolate / elliptical leaf. You will find this year’s flowers and fruits on last year’s growth. The umbel-like elderflowers, (technically corymbs), are borne on terminal stems. Five creamy-white petals surround the yellow anthers. When ripe, and picked on a sunny day, are bursting with pollen and scent, and should be a bright lemon-yellow. They turn brown when past their best. Only pick ripe flowers! The flowers have a small amount of natural yeast on them which assists fermentation when making drinks. This will be testified by anyone who makes the superb thirst quenching elderflower champagne! The rank smell of elder leaves or the gone-over flowers is known to repel many who come across it, often being described as a cat urine smell!  After a short but sweet period in full bloom, the flowers give rise to upstanding clusters of small berries, which are typically no bigger than 10mm in diameter. Initially green, the berries gradually begin to nod earthwards as they ripen. At the end of the summer they are dark purple – with many medicinal uses. Parts used Flowers, berries, leaves, bark, fungi. Harvest time The flowers are picked when in full bloom. The berries are picked when ripe in the autumn. Key active medicinal constituents Tannins, potassium, mucilage, phenols, triterpenes, sterols, lectins, flavonoids (including rutin). The dark coloured berries are rich in anthocyanins, folic acid and vitamins A and C. They also contain flavonoids, and cyanidin glucosides, which are poisonous in large doses.  Medicinal actions Diaphoretic, febrifuge, anti-catarrhal, anti viral, immuno-supportive. Uses – Elderflowers and berries are expectorant and diaphoretic, thus they help to manage and reduce fevers and to rid the body of toxins. – Elderflowers are also anti-viral and are useful in combating herpes simplex type 1 virus (responsible for cold sores). – The flowers can be made into champagne, cordials, wine, sorbet, jam and fritters. – Elderberry extract has been proven to inhibit various strains of flu, especially if taken early enough. Many people can testify that elder can significantly reduce recovery times from influenza. – Some books have stated the ripe berries are poisonous, but this is slightly misleading. They will cause gastric upset if you eat a large quantity raw, (as will too many apples while scrumping) but in small amounts they should present no problem. Cooked into jams, syrups etc., larger quantities of elderberries are absolutely fine. – Pioneering contemporary forager-chefs have rediscovered that even the green berries can be used, as ‘capers’, if prepared correctly. This involves fermenting the berries in a salt brine solution for a few days, similar to preparing green walnuts for pickling, and then covering in a flavoured vinegar. – Even when the tree is dormant in the winter, it is still possible to harvest food! The ‘Jelly ear’ fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is often found on elder, dead or alive. Known as a delicacy in China, it is best cooked sliced into thin strips, in a spicy, oriental-style soup.

"There’s a plethora of info out there about comfrey but not much detail regarding establishing and managing a comfrey patch so I thought I would write an article to share my experience on this and how we grow comfrey as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden. A member of the borage family, comfrey – Symphytum spp. is native to Europe and Asia and there are 40 recorded species throughout that region. The plant most commonly referred to and used in gardens is Russian comfrey – Symphytum x uplandicum, a naturally occurring hybrid of two wild species: common comfrey – Symphytum officinale and prickly comfrey – Symphytum asperum. A few centuries back, the hybrid Symphytum x uplandicum came to the attention of Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) and he widely promoted the plant as a food and forage crop. Years later, and after two world wars, Lawrence D Hills (1911-1991) would continue Henry Doubleday’s Comfrey crusade. In the 1950s, Hills developed a comfrey research program in the village of Bocking, near Braintree in the UK. The original trial site is on the plot of land now occupied by the Doubleday Gardens housing development. Lawrence Hills lived at 20 Convent Lane just around the corner of the trial site. At this site, Hills trialed at least 21 comfrey ‘strains’, each one named after the village Bocking. Strain 14 was identified as being the most nutrient rich, non-seeding strain and ‘Bocking 14’ began its journey into gardens far and wide across the world. (Learn more its history on the Balkan Ecology Project blog.) Medicinal – Comfrey has been cultivated as a healing herb since at least 400BC. The Greeks and Romans commonly used comfrey to stop heavy bleeding, treat bronchial problems and heal wounds and broken bones. Poultices were made for external wounds and tea was consumed for internal ailments. Comfrey has been reported to promote healthy skin with its mucilage content that moisturizes and soothes and promotes cell proliferation. This plant is my first port of call if ever I need to dress a wound. Simply take a few leaves brush them together to remove the hairs and wrap them around the wound and apply light pressure. It’s incredibly effective at stopping the bleeding, reducing the pain and healing the wound. Biomas – Comfrey produces large amounts of foliage from late May (late spring) until hard frosts in October or November (late autumn). The plant is excellent for producing mulch and can be cut from 2-5 times per year depending on how well the plants are watered and fed. The plant grows rapidly after each harvest. In our gardens we have Comfrey ‘Bocking 14’ located next to each fruit tree in order to have a renewable source of mulch just where we need it. We also grow in patches as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden and have patches in the wildflower meadows (details below). We’ve supplied 1,000 ‘Bocking 14’ cuttings to Oxygenisis, a business in Germany who are experimenting with using this plant for carbon capture. Mineral dam – Comfrey has deep roots of up to 2m that utilize nutrients deep in the subsoil that would otherwise wash away with the underground soil water or remain inaccessible to other plants. The nutrients, once taken up from the roots, are relocated throughout the plant as and where needed with some of them ending up in the comfrey leaf mass. When cutting the leaf mass and applying to the soil surface, the mined nutrients are returned and again made accessible to shallower rooted crop plants.  Biodiversity – The bell shaped flowers provide nectar and pollen to many species of bees and other insects from late May until the first frosts in late autumn. Lacewings are said to lay eggs on comfrey and spiders overwinter on the plant. Parasitoid wasps and spiders will hunt on and around comfrey. Pest and disease prevention and control – Research indicates that a comfrey solution can be used to prevent powdery mildew. Pest predators such as spiders, lacewings and parasatoid wasps associate with this plant. It’s best to leave some plants alone in order to sustain pest predator relationships. Ground cover – Some species can quickly spread to form a thick ground cover and work particularly well for ground cover on the sunny side under shrubs and trees. Symphytum tuberosum – Tuberous Comfrey seems to be the best species for this.  Fertilizer – Comfrey leaves contain a great balance of major plant nutrients (N,P,K) and can be fed to plants as powder, direct mulch or by steeping chopped comfrey leaves in water for several weeks to produce a thick, dark liquid that can be diluted with water and applied to plant roots. More on this below. Nutritional value of comfrey – You can see from the below table that wilted comfrey contains significantly higher quantities of potash compared to other organic fertilizers. It’s well recorded that comfrey is an excellent source of potassium (K) a major plant nutrient that is required by plants in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction. Animal fodder – Comfrey has a long history for use as an animal feed. Lawrence D Hills dedicated books to this topic.* The leaves are best received by animals wilted. Fresh leaves can be eaten by pigs, sheep, and poultry but cattle, rabbits and horses will only consume wilted leaves. Human consumption – Symphytum officianale and Symphytum x uplandicum are both reported to be used for salad and potherb and are best when cooked. Personally I’m not keen on the texture but will have the occasional nibble from the garden using the new growth to mix in a spring green salad. Caution – Although comfrey has been used as a food crop, in the past 20 years scientific studies reported that comfrey may be carcinogenic, since it appeared to cause liver damage and cancerous tumors in rats. These reports have temporarily restricted development of comfrey as a food crop. In light of this, the regular consumption of comfrey is not advisable.  Life cycle – Herbaceous perennial Growth habit – Comfrey begins growth in early-April and by early May compact clusters of young leaves are visible in the crown of the old plant. Within a few weeks, the leaf blades with long petioles have grown to over 35cm high. Basal leaves are large, lance-shaped, stalked, and coarsely hairy. The leaves die back following the first frost and remain dormant for winter. Many species can spread vigorously via seed and are generally not welcome in the garden because of this. Other species can spread via tubers and all species quickly regenerate from broken root pieces.  Flowering – Starts in late May or early June and continues until the first frost in late autumn. The bell-shaped flowers with pedicels are in terminal cymes or one-sided clusters. Flowers of common comfrey are usually creamy yellow, but white, red, or purple types have been found in Europe. Prickly comfrey has pink and blue flowers while Russian comfrey has blue, purple, or red-purple flowers. Tuberous comfrey has creamy white flowers. Vegetative growth does not cease with the start of flowering, and the plant will add new stems continuously during the growing season. Most comfrey plants can be somewhat invasive, spreading via seed to parts of the garden where they are not wanted. ‘Bocking 14’ will flower and provide nectar and pollen but will not produce viable seed. Roots – Some species have short, thick, tuberous roots such as Symphytum tuberosum. Others such as Symphytum x uplandicum have deep and expansive root systems. Light – Needs full sun for good biomass production but grows fine in the shade. Shade – Tolerates light shade (about 50%). Moisture – Some species are drought tolerant e.g. Symphytum tuberosum. Cultivated plants require irrigation. USDA Hardiness Zone – 4-9 comfrey crowns and roots are very winter hardy.  Soil – Comfrey is adaptable to many soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils.  pH – Tolerates a wide range (6.5-8.5), although not very sensitive to soil pH, highest yields are reported to occur on soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Perhaps you’re interested in growing comfrey to feed your animals, for medicine, for mulch, for compost or you’re slightly masochistic and want to roll around naked in the pricky beds of biomass (not me). In any case, here’s how to do it. The plant we use in our gardens is Symphytum x uplandicum – ‘Bocking 14’. A sterile cultivar that produces copious quantities of nutrient dense biomass. The following information is based on using this plant.  Choosing the site – We’re growing for biomass and want the plants to receive as much light as possible. Accordingly, we lay out our beds on an east to west axis (we’re in the northern hemisphere).  Irrigation is necessary if you want to get good yields from the plants so picking a place with access to irrigation is of paramount important.  In areas of low rainfall, using the gradient of the land to channel precipitation towards your beds will reduce the water needs of your plants. In areas of high rainfall with a high water table you should consider diverting water away from the beds. Once established, comfrey is difficult to get rid of, so choose a site where you want it to stay. Don’t plant comfrey in any area you cultivate, as the broken root pieces quickly establish into new plants and can out compete slower growing crops.  Position comfrey downhill from where you expect leachate to be present, i.e downhill from a manure pile , compost heap, outside toilet, animal pen etc., can provide passive fertility to the plants and rescue otherwise lost minerals from draining away with the sub soil ground water. 
Grow the comfrey where you want to use it. As you’ll see later we may be harvesting over 1/4 ton biomass from our patch and don’t want to be carrying that over long distances. Preparing the site – Raised beds are a major part of our fertility strategy and overtime retain water and nutrients very efficiently. I use 1.3m wide beds surrounded by 50cm paths for our crops as this allows easy access for harvesting everywhere in the beds without ever having to tread on the soil and the paths are wise enough to take our lawnmower. To form a bed, the area should be cleared of all plants, which is best achieved by sheet mulching the season before. Pernicious perennials or tap rooted biennials should be dug out. After you have cleared the whole area, mark out the bed shape with string and dig out 50cm wide paths around your beds, applying the soil to the surface of the planting area and thereby creating the initial rise of the bed. Fork over the beds well. If a hardpan is present take the time and effort to eliminate it before planting. Depending on the quality of your soil you may want to add extra compost before planting into the bed. If you have sheet mulched the area before hand, with the additional soil from the paths all you need to do is add a good 20cm thick straw mulch (or some other mulch) and it’s ready for planting. A good mulch to start with will help keep the weeds down while your comfrey gets going. You can alter the depth and gradient of the paths to facilitate the required direction of water movement. Planting material – You can plant out with crown divisions or root cuttings best done in the spring when the soil has warmed. A crown division can be obtained from simply putting a spade through the center of a mature comfrey plant and transplanting the divided sections. For our beds, I divided two year old plants into quarters, sometimes sixths, and these established very well in the first year. It’s bests not to harvest the leaf biomass in the first year in order to allow a deep root system to develop. However if you use large divisions you can start harvesting in July. Root cuttings are a great way to plant out large areas of comfrey. The cuttings should be grown on in small pots with 50% compost 50% river sand mix kept moist and planted out in the spring as soon as the first leaves emerge and the soil has warmed. If you are planting large numbers of root cuttings you can plant directly into the beds by creating ‘nests’ in the straw, adding two cupped handfuls of the above mentioned potting mix and plant the cuttings into this. Keep them moist like a wrung out sponge and the success rate will be very close to 100%. Spacing – The plants should be spaced 60cm apart in rows and 60cm apart at diagonals between rows. Plant the rows 15cm from the edge of the beds. Cutting – In the first year allow the plants to establish so that the roots develop well and penetrate deep into the subsoil. Remove any weeds around the plants leaving them on the surface. The following year the cutting can begin. You can scythe the beds for a quick harvest or cut each plant individually with a pair of secateurs or shears cutting to 5cm or so from ground level. The leaves are prickly so if you have sensitive hands wear gloves. Cut the comfrey as the flowering stalks emerge up to four times a year. Allow the plants to flower at least once during the season to provide bee fodder to a range of native bees and honey bees. Leave the last flush of leaves before the winter so that invertebrates can find winter shelter in the undergrowth. You may need to weed between cuts every now and then but generally the comfrey will quickly cover the surface. Feeding – After you have cut the comfrey, mow the pathways between the beds and empty the trimmings to the base of the comfrey plants. Any trimmings from lawns and hedges in the surrounding area can also be used. We are experimenting with growing nitrogen fixing hedging and ground cover plants adjacent to the patch in order to feed our comfrey. A most excellent comfrey feed is undiluted urine applied at a rate of approx 500 ml per plant twice per growing season. Irrigation – Comfrey will produce more biomass if irrigated and in dry climates it’s essential to irrigate. Comfrey plants wilt very fast in hot conditions and will stop photosynthesising at this point. Twenty litres per m2 per week of drought should be more than adequate. The beauty of biological systems are that, if managed properly, each year the soils improve and the ability of the soil to store water will improve over time. We use passive irrigation diverting water from a mountain stream into the paths around the beds. The paths fill with water, we raise the level by blocking the low points with sacks of sawdust and the water is drawn throughout the soil via capillary action. Passive irrigation in our market garden. The paths fill with water and the water permeates throughout the soil via capillary action. As mulch – Freshly cut comfrey leaves make good mulch because they have high nitrogen content, and don’t pull nitrogen from the soil while decomposing. Comfrey’s high potassium content makes it especially beneficial for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, berries, and fruit trees. With adequate feed and watering we’ve seen yields of 2-3kg of biomass per plant per cut. Comfrey beds establishing well. This bed was planted with divided crowns 5 months prior to this photo being taken. Liquid fertliser – What I like to call ‘Comfert’. Fill a barrel, preferably with a bottom tap and a gauze on the inside (to prevent clogging) about 3/4 full with freshly cut comfrey and add water to fill the barrel. Cover it, and let it steep for 3-6 weeks. The smell from the resulting liquid is far from attractive so approach with caution. The tea may be used full strength or diluted by half or more. Don’t apply before heavy rain is forecast as most of the nutrients suspended in the liquid will wash straight through the soil. For the best results apply the feed to your vegetables when they are in most need of the extra fertility. This will be different for each crop, for example, tomatoes are best fed when they are setting fruit and then any time during the fruiting period. Applying comfert before this can be counter productive and make your plants more susceptible to pest problems. The black slurry at the bottom of the barrel can be dispersed evenly back over the comfrey patch. Liquid fertilizer concentrate – ‘Comfert Plus’ can also be made by packing fresh-cut comfrey tops into an old bucket, weighing them down with something heavy, covering tightly, and waiting a few weeks for them to decompose into a black slurry. You can put a hole in the bottom of the bucket and collect the concentrate in another container as it drips out. Dilute this comfrey concentrate about 15 to 1 with water, and use as you would comfert. You can seal this concentrate in plastic jugs until you are ready to use it. Warning! Comfert stinks like hell. My nieces came to visit from London last year and offered to help out in the market garden. One of the tasks that day was to apply comfert to the crops. Let’s just say it did not end well and we had a much better experience taking softwood cuttings the next day. According to Martin Crawford in Creating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops, one cut of comfrey from one plant contains 0.5g of Nitrogen (N) and 10g of potassium (K) to crops. Based on this I calculated how much Potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and biomass the 13 m2 comfrey patch can potentially produce in a year. Below is a table indicating how many comfrey cuts are needed to meet the Nitrogen and Potassium needs of various moderate and heavy cropping fruit and nut trees and annual vegetables. In the 1960s, Lawrence D. Hills used UK gardeners records for a comfrey report. (See the Balkan Ecology Project blog for the results.) Based on these records I calculated a yield of approx. 5.5kg of biomass per plant each year. Using this figure one of our beds should produce approx 286kg of biomass. We shall see as this year we begin our own records. We’re looking to gather some solid data on how comfrey performs in our climate and we’ll be recording the yields from our patch starting this season and for at least the next five years. For more info on our record keeping and research programs see Polyculture Market Garden Study. If you would like to join the ‘who can grow the most comfrey’ experiment and contribute data to our records, send us an email. It will be great to have records from all over the world.

"Hugelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, means hill culture or hill mound. Instead of putting branches, leaves and grass clippings in bags by the curbside for the bin men… build a hugel bed. Simply mound logs, branches, leaves, grass clippings, straw, cardboard, petroleum-free newspaper, manure, compost or whatever other biomass you have available, top with soil and plant your veggies. The advantages of a hugel bed are many, including: The gradual decay of wood is a consistent source of long-term nutrients for the plants. A large bed might give out a constant supply of nutrients for 20 years (or even longer if you use only hardwoods). The composting wood also generates heat which should extend the growing season. Soil aeration increases as those branches and logs break down… meaning the bed will be no till, long term. The logs and branches act like a sponge. Rainwater is stored and then released during drier times. Actually you may never need to water your hugel bed again after the first year (except during long term droughts). Sequester carbon into the soil. On a sod lawn Sepp Holzer (hugelkultur expert) recommends cutting out the sod, digging a one foot deep trench and filling the trench with logs and branches. Then cover the logs with the upside down turf. On top of the turf add grass clippings, seaweed, compost, aged manure, straw, green leaves, mulch, etc…  Sepp Holzer recommends steep hugel beds to avoid compaction from increased pressure over time. Steep beds mean more surface area in your garden for plants and the height makes easy harvesting. The greater the mass, the greater the water-retention benefits. Hugel bed dug in clay with logs put in vertically, next branches and lots of wood chips. Top 6 inches will be wood chips and dirt. This bed will store water and give nutrients for many years to come. Straw bale gardens require less soil, less water and hold heat. As the straw breaks down nutrients feed the plants. Combining a straw surround with a hugel interior, topped by lasagne layering is an excellent idea for an area with poor quality soil. Hugel bed in Ontario, Canada (June 28th) by Tim Burrows. Tim surrounded his very tall hugel bed in pallets! Sheet mulching (lasagne gardening) is like composting in place. Above: just a suggestion as to sheet mulching layers. Nitrogen-rich material such as fresh grass clippings or green leaves put right on the hugelkultur wood would help jump start the composting process. Could also include seaweed, straw, dead leaves, leaf mould, etc.

The first year of break down means the wood (and fungi) steal a lot of the nitrogen out of the surrounding environment, so adding nitrogen during the first year or planting crops that add nitrogen to the soil (like legumes) or planting species with minimal nitrogen requirements is necessary, unless there is plenty of organic material on top of the wood. After the wood absorbs nitrogen to its fill, the wood will start to break down and start to give nitrogen back in the process. In the end you will be left with a beautiful bed of nutrient rich soil. Tree types that work well in hugelkultur:
Hardwoods break down slowly and therefore your hugel bed will last longer, hold water for more years and add nutrients for more years. But softwoods are acceptable as well, a softwood bed will just disintegrate quicker. Mixing woods with softwoods and branches on top, to give off nutrients first, and hardwoods on bottom, sounds like a plan if you have access to multiple types of wood. Yet the newly decomposing softwoods at the top will eat up a lot of nitrogen at first, so compensate for that.

Woods that work best:
Alders, apple, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, oak, poplar, willow (make sure it is dead or it will sprout).

Trees types that work okay:
Black cherry (use only rotted), camphor wood (well aged), cedar/juniper/yew (anti-microbial/anti-fungal, so use only at very bottom or unless already well-aged. Cedar should be broken down before new plant roots reach it), eucalyptus (slightly anti-microbial), osage orange (exceptionally resistant to decay), Pacific yew (exceptionally resistant to decay), pine/fir/spruce (tannins and sap), red mulberry (exceptionally resistant to decay).

Tree types to avoid:
Black locust (will not decompose), black walnut (juglone toxin), old growth redwood (heartwood will not decompose and redwood compost can prevent seed germination).

"Thistles are a bane of picnickers and campers. Who hasn’t trodden on the sharp, unforgiving spines of a thistle when out and about barefoot in grasslands? For many people, relationships with thistles have generally been painful and irritable, but now you can get your own back! One of the great things about thistles is that every single species is edible, so this is great news for foraging beginners! Even the closest lookalikes found here are edible – the sow thistles (Sonchus spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), so when working with the thistles, you can learn to identify and proceed to experiment with complete confidence from the outset. We have at least 14 species of thistle growing wild in the UK, mostly from the Cirsium (aka plume thistles) and Carduus genera. Thistles are found in numerous settings all over our islands and can be a useful soil barometer. Often their presence signifies that the land is fertile, and in many instances, neglected. I eat from a number of different species. These are: creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis), spear thistle (C. vulgare), woolly thistle (C. eriophorum), marsh thistle (C. palustris), and welted thistle (Carduus acanthoides syn C. crispus). As you will discover, plants that have spines to offer protection against predators, have no real need for bitterness. Spear thistle It’s almost impossible to misidentify a thistle. One of the easy-to-spot botanical differences between thistles and their numerous relatives in the daisy family, is that the overlapping bracts (involucre) found directly below the flowers of thistles, are always spiny. Simple! The leaves of the numerous species will differ in size, shape and the density of spine coverage. Most have stiff spines on the margins, but some have soft prickles. You need to discover for yourself which are the more tactile! When in flower, most thistles produce a lovely purple / mauve bloom, but some species are known for their yellow inflorescence (cabbage thistle – Cirsium oleraceum and the Carline thistle – Carlina vulgaris). In all of the thistles, flowers give way to copious amounts of fluffy hairs (pappus) attached to their tiny fruits, superbly designed for air-borne dispersal. A distinguishing feature between the two main generais that Cirsium spp. produce feathered pappus hairs, whereas Carduus spp. only have simple pappus hairs. Creeping thistle produces dense spines on its leaves, but very few spines or hairs on the flowering stems. Spear thistle has large, deeply-lobed leaves with large spines at the margins, as well as hairy, spiny stems. Marsh thistle looks somewhat like spear thistle at an initial glance, but without the large spines and leaf lobes, and usually with a thin, red, leaf margin. Woolly thistle is easily identifiable with large, deeply-lobed, evenly-shaped leaves, and very large flower heads, wrapped in a ‘cobweb’ of cotton-like hairs. This particular species is the largest wild thistle I use, although if you have milk thistle (Silybum marianum) growing in your plot, you can use that too, but you will need good gloves to protect yourself from its long spiny flower heads! Eating milk thistle chokes would of course prevent you harvesting the exceptional liver-supportive medicine found in the seeds. Wooly thistle Creeping thistle will grow in all manner of waste-ground, grasslands, verges and field edges. I also see a lot of spear thistle in similar habitats, although when found in grassland, it’s not as abundant as the creeping species. The root systems explain why; spear thistle has a tap root, whereas creeping thistle grows on rhizomes. The marsh thistle, as its name alludes to, likes damp conditions such as fens, marshes, canal tow-paths and riversides. Woolly thistle is a little bit more selective in its choice of soil and setting, preferring calcareous ground. It too enjoys grasslands. Welted thistle can be found all over the UK, especially loving clay soils. Go prepared! Stiff gloves and a knife are required. Harvest the best leaf mid-ribs in spring when growth is plentiful and quick. Your specimens will be tender and sweeter. Flowering stems will appear from late spring through into autumn. I only consider harvesting from plants whose flower buds are yet to really begin unfurling. Flower buds (chokes) are available all summer. In Portugal, a number of thistle species are still collected in spring and sold at markets. A recent academic study highlighted the nutritional value from eating thistles. The findings are contained within ‘Ethnobotany In The New Europe’ by Manuel. P de Santayana et al. (Eds), published June 2010. In the study, researchers noted the wide range of thistle species collected, and concentrated on the nutritional value of one particular thistle (Scolymus hispanicus – Spanish or golden thistle). This plant is collected by villagers in various areas of the countryside. Bunches of the stripped leaf mid-ribs are sold and bought in a number of markets in different areas. Levels of certain nutrients were analysed and compared to some commonly consumed vegetables. Their findings show that the thistle contained consistently higher levels of important major nutrients than some of our commonly consumed cultivated vegetables. Weight for weight, thistles come out higher in fibre, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc and other nutrients. Is it likely that the thistles found wild here will be similarly endowed with a range of important vitamins and minerals? I’m more than happy to work on the assumption that this will be the case. Many other wild plant species are known to contain high concentrations of important nutrients. Preparing thistles is pretty easy. Simply choose the most tender specimens. If using the petioles, then cut and strip all the spines off, before peeling the outer, fibrous layer from the stalk. Use raw as crudités, pickle or ferment them, or chop into salads and serve them with a tangy vinaigrette. If cooking, they don’t require long! Preparing the stems is similar, but they are hollow. These can be used in similar ways to the petioles, or you can stuff them, roast them, and braise them. As relatives of the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), thistles produce edible, if smaller, ‘chokes’. These are the crunchy, immature bases, or capitulum, of the composite flower-head. As you would do with globe artichokes, peel away the bracts to get to the prize. I only choose the largest wild species for this. Happy foraging!

"Some plants seem to be our constant companions, no matter where we live. Often, they will also be some of our really useful species. It will soon become clear that the common mallow (Malva sylvestris) is one of these plants. Rather than being looked upon as a weed, the mallows can be more usefully described as some of our gloriously abundant plant helpers. A number of mallow species have long been used as a food and medicine, wherever they are found native, and especially in the Middle East and Asia. You won’t have far to go to find the common mallow in most parts of Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia either. Common mallow can be found growing erect or prostrate, which may initially cause confusion because it’s easy to assume they might be two different species. Mallow’s kidney-shaped or palmately-lobed leaves are notably creased, typically with dentate margins. The leaves often show a purple spot in the centre of the base of the leaf and this can also be seen to run down the petiole on some specimens. On other specimens, the purple spotting and colouring is completely absent. Mallow leaves have long petioles. Their deep green foliage hints at a renowned drought tolerance. During flowering, the leaves appear alternately on the stems. Holding a leaf relays the surface coarseness. But tear and crush one, and you discover a family pattern – the mucilage. You will soon experience a slimy and tacky feel between your fingers. All parts of the plant contain mucilage. In bloom, the Malvaceae family plants produce five large notched petals in each open flower. Common mallow has showy pink petals laced with darker-coloured strokes. In the centre of the flower lies a pollen-loaded column of fused stamens. This surrounds the stigma, which rises above the column.  Mallow is known to freely seed. The round seed pods, known as ‘cheeses’, soon follow flowering. These were once munched by children on their way to and from school. The pods are held on stalks, close to the flowering stem. Mallow will be found on most soils, from coastal to marginally upland habitats, with most settings being adequate for this resilient plant. It loves waste-ground as well as grassland; gravel as much as coastal edges, and waysides and roadsides as well as hedges.  Leaves, flowers, seed pods, roots. Leaves, in spring; flowers from late spring; seed pods from early summer. Roots could be harvested from larger rosettes whenever large enough. Medicinal and nutritional constituents Vitamins A,B,C,E; inulin; mucilage; phenols; flavonoids; essential fatty acids; fibre; calcium; magnesium; zinc; selenium; potassium. Traditional and contemporary uses As with many wild food plants, the common mallow has also had a long history of medicinal use. Due to its high mucilage content, mallows make excellent soothing demulcent herbs, especially for cases of inflammation, either for the urinary, digestive or respiratory systems. Pregnant women or new mothers may like to know that mallow leaves can provide useful amounts of iron, as well as being quite high in zinc and most vitamins.  All of the mallow family with exception to the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum), are reportedly edible. With their high mucilage content, the leaves can usefully be taken as an emergency antidote to irritation or burning that may be caused by the accidental consumption of acrid plants in the buttercup family. Creative cooks can substitute mallow for spinach in many dishes, including soups, salads, gnocchi and quiche. I have even flash-fried larger mallow leaves for just one second in hot oil to make ‘popadoms’. Mallow also makes a great addition to soups, whereby the mucilage helps to thicken them.  In Jewish culture, mallow has been been considered the ‘most important plant in local gather society’. Every spring mallow is gathered in the countryside. Its common name in both Hebrew and Arabic, translates to ‘bread’.  During the war of 1948, when Jerusalem was under siege, mallow was an important famine crop, and one that is still celebrated on Independence day every year with a traditional dish made from mallow leaves. Common mallow can be substituted for the family relative Corchorus olitorius aka ‘jutes mallow’, when making the Egyptian / Middle-Eastern dish ‘Molokhia’. This traditional dish is usually served with chicken.  In China, mallow roots are a popular and a common ingredient in making hearty, yet medicinally potent soups and broths. The inulin-rich tap roots of a number of different mallow species, including common mallow, have been used. The seed pods can be substituted for most of the egg white if wanting to make mallow meringues. Simply boil up the peeled seed pods using 3 parts water 1 part seed pods, and reduce the liquid by half. For every half cup of liquid add one egg white, ¼ tsp of cream of tartar, some vanilla and castor sugar, then whip it up until foamy and stiff, just like meringues.  21st Century Foraging  The Medicinal Forest Garden  The Fast Wild Food Cookbookby Johnny Jumbalaya  Amazing Moringa: Medicinal, Edible & Easy to Grow  How to Make your own Sloe Gin Chris Hope, aka Chris Phyto, was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic plant lover, forager and teacher, who sadly died in 2021.";Permaculture Magazine UK

(400g tin, drained)
1-2 tbsp chopped herbs – basil, parsley or oregano (or a mixture of all three)
Salt and pepper to taste For the garlic bread
A crusty loaf of bread 
4-10 cloves garlic (I like it strong!)
0.5-1 cup olive oil (it depends how large the loaf is)
Pepper
An oven dish approximately 25 x 25cm (10 x 10in) Preheat the oven to 180oC fan (200oC/400oF/gas mark 6). Finely chop the garlic and mix into the olive oil. Add a little pepper, stir and leave to infuse. Slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways into 5mm thick slices. Pour some olive oil into the pan and soften the onions, garlic and celery on a low heat.  When cooked, add the red pepper, beans and tomatoes. Simmer for around 15 minutes until the sauce is cooked through. Meanwhile, drizzle olive oil onto a griddle and cook the aubergines and courgettes, several slices at a time, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Pour some of the tomato sauce into the oven dish, add a layer of aubergine, then more sauce, a layer of courgette, and so on until the dish is filled with layers of sauce, aubergine and courgette. Decorate with slices of tomato. Put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Slice the bread so the knife goes about 90% through the loaf, leaving the base intact and the slices attached to each other. Put in a baking dish and, using a spoon, drizzle the garlic oil over both sides of each slice.  15 minutes before the lasagne is ready, put the bread in the oven. When the lasagne is cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the crusty garlic bread and a large salad, or dish of steamed seasonal green vegetables. Tip – Frying pan will work if you don’t have a griddle. This recipe adapts well to other vegetables. In the winter, use slices of cooked potato, parsnip, sweet potato or squash.

"My name is Suzanne Pendleton and I live in Swinton, Salford (UK) and have been involved in the Greater Manchester Swift Street initiative since August 2024, which has been led by the RSPB. During lockdown I started to value my time outside as so many families did too. I enjoyed time in our little garden more and spotted some birds as they zoomed and screamed over the house. I wasn’t quite sure what they were and asked my friend Kathleen who lived on a surrounding road what they might be. She enlightened me. They were Swifts, a species recently added to the UK’s Red List of birds, meaning they are now amongst our most threatened. Then the summer was over and the swifts left Swinton heading back to Africa.  Each year since, I have eagerly anticipated the return of the Swifts. My understanding grew and I learnt of their declining numbers, now less than 60,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Along with developing a stiff neck constantly looking up to the sky, watching their incredible aerial manoeuvres.  I am privileged to live in a friendly neighbourhood on our lane. The community are always up for helping, and we pull together to help each other. We have a community messaging service which came into its own in lockdown, and continues to be a fabulous way to share information and request help and advice. During the last few years I had messaged our community group and asked if anyone knew about our Swifts and where they were nesting. Initially we were unsuccessful in understanding, but in spring 2024 we struck lucky and finally worked out the eaves where they lived. I’d also discovered Swift Mapper (an app for recording the location of Swift nesting sites) enabling us to understand we had four nest sites on the Lane and surrounding roads.  We also realised that there was another small colony locally less that 1/4 mile away. Last August, a resident of this local road got in touch to say Roshni (Parmar-Hill, Community Engagement Officer) from the RSPB had been to visit their colony. She asked if we’d be interested in getting involved with developing our Swift Street – thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery – and I eagerly accepted the offer. We used our community messaging group to share the news of the Swift Street development and I was overwhelmed by the local response. So many families were keen to help our Swift population, with more than 80 boxes requested. I think the consensus was that we are so privileged that these incredible urban birds choose our lane as their home, and as their nesting places can be threatened by redevelopment, having the opportunity to install boxes is a wonderful chance to do something proactive to help.  Roshni and I visited local homes who had expressed interest, helping families select potential sites for their boxes to be positioned. With Roshni’s guidance we talked about what Swifts need and I and residents began to understand more about how Swifts live. They are remarkably compatible with humans, don’t need a bird bath, bird table etc. as they feed on insects on the wing. I discovered along with other residents that the best way we could help our Swifts was to protect their current nesting sites, add boxes for more birds to nest in and to do all we could to support insect populations. For example, considering planting in our gardens to promote insect life, adopting No Mow May and not using insecticides. Those who weren’t able to install a box could instead help in other ways, so this made the project accessible for all – everyone could join in. Next came the production of the boxes. Roshni contacted local colleges and we were thrilled when a local skills centre suggested their joinery students could make these free of charge. Production began and numbers of those interested had grown as the message about the project spread, and so 100 boxes were produced.  Meanwhile, local guiding groups learnt of the initiative and Roshni visited the groups that I lead, as Brown Owl – 90 girls and young women were keen to learn about Swifts and how they could help. The groups were already keen to learn about environmental matters, and this project really whetted their appetite. The Brownies, Guides and Rangers designed posters, made seed bombs and grew in their understanding of our Swifts. Once the production of the boxes was finished the Brownies, Rangers and Guides got stuck into painting them with an environmentally friendly product which would protect the boxes, and a local lady Haldis (a RSPB Swift Champion, a voluntary role which supports local conservation efforts to protect the species) made the nest cups which would be inserted into each box.  We arrived at installation day on Saturday 8th March, with 25 boxes going up on that first day. By the end of March, 80 had been erected by a local roofer, Ryan. Of course, we needed to celebrate the returning of our precious Swifts and so we began planning our community event. Volunteers came forward from the surrounding roads and we met in a resident’s kitchen each Wednesday, so all could contribute ideas. Other local guiding groups wanted to contribute and so they made nature-themed bunting, and we were thrilled when the church on the lane offered their venue as a space for us to celebrate. The local dance and drama group wanted to be involved and so their leaders and young people planned songs and a drama production with poetry. And as if we weren’t already exciting enough, we then heard the news that RSPB Ambassador Megan McCubbin would love to come along to formally open our Swift Street.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on 17th May, with a fantastic community event. Sixty families made bee hotels, children had Swift-themed face paint, and a plant swap was popular. RSPB provided and led crafts, and local artists supported youngsters to make Swift puppets. More than 300 residents attended and watched the young people perform. The ribbon was cut revealing a beautiful Swift Street banner created by a local artist, alongside Swift boxes 99 and 100 positioned proudly on the front of the church. And yes, we had Swifts soaring high above us all day (perhaps watching the proceedings?) to the delight of the watching children and residents. As the street party continued into the evening we couldn’t believe our eyes when a ‘banger’ (a young Swift, which gets its name from its tendency to bang against prospective nest to check if they’re occupied or not) attempted to enter one of the newly positioned boxes. A perfect end to a fabulous day.  It’s been an absolute honour to be involved in this project and I feel so lucky that our community have been able to do something practical to support our local Swifts.

"We are delighted to announce the recipients of the 2025 Permaculture Magazine Award, in collaboration with Lush Spring Prize. Four projects have been awarded from a fund of £25,000. The Permaculture Magazine Award is a celebration of the vital work of permaculture projects from around the world. The Permaculture Magazine Award was established in 2018 to celebrate the vital work of permaculture projects around the world. To date (May 2025) it has awarded 28 projects with over £155,000. The award has received hundreds of applications, and it is a privilege to highlight this vital regenerative work that is world changing. Coordinating a network of permaculture centres, NGO Permaculture Ukraine offers training, events and educational resources across Ukraine, also ensuring accessibility for internally displaced people (IDP) and former military personnel. The organisation was founded following the first Permaculture Design Course (PDC) in Ukraine in 2011, and has held at least one PDC annually, actively seeking funding to make training accessible to vulnerable groups. Following the full-scale invasion in 2022, its focus expanded to include: The 14 permaculture centres provide training, shelter for IDPs and war-abandoned animals, and rehabilitation for children and adults. Its designers also create communal projects, including schools and homes for disabled people. Despite air raids and blackouts, NGO Permaculture Ukraine successfully hosted a two-day permaculture festival in Kyiv’s botanical garden in September 2024, drawing 100 participants eager to engage with top regenerative practitioners. NGO Permaculture Ukraine empowers Ukrainians for sustainable living and transformative change. Through active social media engagement and collaborations with ecovillages, zero-waste networks, and other ecological movements, it extends its influence and inspires a growing audience to adopt permaculture principles for Ukraine’s regeneration. https://permaculture.in.ua Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Since its founding in 2021, Battmung has: Recognising the importance of connecting people, Battmung also contributed to the founding of the Permaculture Institute of Korea (P.I.K) in 2023. Its goal is to organise its regional network and regenerate South Korea through permaculture, restoring soil, food chains, ecological awareness, and local economies. www.instagram.com/battmung.log Eco Centro Allpa Tarpuna works for the regeneration of degraded lands, food sovereignty and community autonomy, with a focus on indigenous communities in Ecuador. Founded in 2004, it was born out of the return of its founders to their community after experiencing the negative impacts of conventional agriculture and agrochemicals. This return marked the beginning of a path towards reconnecting with indigenous ancestral knowledge and adopting permaculture and organic production. One of the key achievements has been the recovery of soils degraded by monocultures and eucalyptus. Although slow, this process has demonstrated the benefits of a regenerative approach and strengthened the resilience of the community. Allpa Tarpuna is currently focusing on: Allpa Tarpuna integrates bio-construction, renewable energy and sustainable water management into its practices. It also encourages the preservation of ancestral seeds and agro-ecological techniques such as crop rotation, reducing dependence on chemicals. In the future, it wants to expand its training in permaculture design, combining indigenous knowledge with modern regenerative solutions. It seeks to empower more local farmers, promoting designs that restore the connection between people and nature. Allpa Tarpuna is a living indigenous family that sows regeneration, inspiring a sustainable and resilient balance. https://allpatarpuna.org HortaFCUL is a community-based permaculture project based in Lisbon University’s Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). The initiative was launched by a group of biology students concerned about the gap between sustainability ideals and the university’s environmental impact. This bottom-up project has developed an important role as a catalyst of practical scientific-based knowledge. Nowadays, HortaFCUL is a resilient, sustainable and inclusive community, allowing the general public to learn more about nature-based solutions. It has five subprojects at campus level and relies on a volunteer-based horizontally-organised guardians collective to maintain the project’s green areas. HortaFCUL, as a permaculture project, achieves its central goals by closing functional loops related to human activities.

"As politicians wait, grassroots changemakers are restoring ecosystems and rebuilding resilience. They are living examples that regeneration is not just possible, it’s already happening all over the world.  The Lush Spring Prize 2025 is showcasing this work and has awarded around £250,000 to 19 groups, celebrating regenerative organisations and practitioners from around the world. Lead image: Clockwise from top left: Agro-Pueblos (Colombia), Ñu’u Ndito (Mexico), Global Ecovillage Network (Global), Land in Our Names (UK) In a joyous, collaborative and inspiring week of celebrations, the 2025 recipients were honoured as part of a celebratory event held in Dorset (UK), where the Lush Cosmetics company is headquartered. The event was attended by prize recipients, Spring Prize judges, Lush staff, press, funders and other regenerative practitioners. Co-designed with the prize recipients themselves, the event provides a space to connect, co-learn and share stories of regeneration. It offered an opportunity to explore both the diversity of people and organisations that make up the regenerative movement and the common challenges, learnings and successes that unites it. Each Spring Prize year sees different themes emerge that are shaped by the organisations that receive a prize. In 2025, these include the importance of weaving ancestral wisdom with scientific approaches; working at multiple scales and legally recognising the rights of nature, and learning from those on the frontlines that are facilitating regenerative work in conflict zones or regions experiencing natural disasters. In 2025, the backdrop of violence and conflict looms large. Prize recipients from Lebanon and Ukraine are responding to invasions by powerful aggressors, in Myanmar they are working in a context of ongoing internal conflict and many of the Indigenous groups are frequently facing the threat of violence.  The Spring Prize 2025 event allows these groups to come together and share what regenerative work in these situations looks like in a way that may challenge the existing narrative: “In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the biggest achievement for our organisation is to continue our activities and find ways to be useful for Ukrainian society like creating permaculture public spaces and rehabilitating people in our demonstration centers. The war has taught us that strength is in unity and networks, that autonomous homesteads and farms that grow their own food and preserve their seeds can not only survive but also help other people, and that international support and networks matter.” NGO Permaculture in Ukraine While humanity witnesses declining biodiversity, climate catastrophes and widespread conflict, these organisations highlight how regenerative practices are not just a source of hope but a necessary and much needed response.

Examples of this year’s awarded projects include: Aguaje palm tree seedlings were distributed among Kukama families in Parinari, Loreto, Peru, as part of the reforestation and conservation initiative led by Huaynakana. Extractivism represents a constant threat to the Kukama territory in Peru and the loss of the Kukama peoples’ cultural identity. Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana exists to protect this. The Kukama people conceive of the territory as a whole and women having an intrinsic connection to it. The term ‘kukama’ for example is composed of two words: ‘ku’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘kama’ meaning ‘bosom,’ and it signifies ‘field-bosom’ or ‘nourished by the field.’ Given the Kukama peoples’ lives are reliant on the forest ecosystems of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and considering how they have adapted and coexisted with them for decades, the territory and the rivers are inseparable from their culture and way of life. They consider the rivers to be living beings with spirits, and therefore sacred. Founded in 2001, Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana embarked on a long journey of collective actions, protests, and mobilisations in pursuit of environmental justice as the river’s health declined as a result of extractive industries. In September 2021 Huaynakana filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognise the Marañón River as a living being and subject of rights. In March 2024, the provincial court of Nauta ruled that the Marañón River has intrinsic rights, including the right to flow, to be free from pollution, and to be restored to environmental health. This decision also recognised Indigenous communities as the river’s legal representatives, defenders, and guardians. This landmark ruling was ratified by the higher court last November. Huaynakana plays a key role in defending the Marañón’s rights and supporting the regeneration and conservation of the waterways through reforestation efforts because without the river, these unique forests cannot exist. Mushrooms harvested from the Ubuntu food forest Ubuntu Learning Hub Trust was set up in 2022 with a mission to support people who are in transition towards more resilient futures and a healthier planet. The Trust immediately began to set up the Ubuntu Learning Centre as an open learning space for all ages as well as a demonstration centre for integrating technologies that are in tune with a healthy Mother Earth. The learning centre sits on a two-hectare site in Chikancila village in Chongwe district of Lusaka Province of Zambia. It is founded on the African philosophy of Ubuntu which helps people to learn what it means to be truly human. It hosts people from all walks of life who are looking for pathways to escape the rat race and curve more sustainable futures for themselves, their families and the communities where they come from. The Trust uses agro-ecological practices to regenerate the degraded farmland that was damaged over decades of poor land husbandry. For example, the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) technique has helped to restore much of the indigenous vegetation on the land. People come to Ubuntu to explore the meaning of life and to find their life purpose. They stay at Ubuntu for varying lengths of time and in the process they are engaged in intercultural exchanges as well as learning how to take care of themselves and of Mother Earth. The Trust offers life changing experiences rather than certificates and the opportunity to carve out an earth-centred worldview for themselves.

Harvesting with Battmung friends The LUSH Spring Prize is a joint venture between LUSH Cosmetics and Ethical Consumer and is now in its sixth prize cycle, having started in 2017. The Spring Prize has distributed more than £1.3 million to regenerative projects worldwide. The LUSH Spring Prize was set up to support ‘regenerative’ projects – those that go beyond sustainability by taking holistic approaches to building the health of ecology, economy and social systems. It seeks to support those who are leaving the world lusher than they found it, and are actively restoring all the systems they are part of. By supporting regenerative projects the Spring Prize hopes to raise the profile of the movement as a whole to inspire more individuals, groups, communities, funders, media platforms and businesses to start engaging with regenerative processes.  The Spring Prize judging panels are made up of people drawn from a diverse range of movements that represent regenerative design, permaculture, food sovereignty, transition towns, biomimicry, eco-village networks and various social justice movements. Each prize cycle a ‘Lush Customer Judge’ and ‘Lush Staff Judge’ are also selected to act as additional independent members of the judging panel.  The collaborative prizes have separate panels, which also include judges from the main Spring Prize panel. The majority of the judging panel for the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Award self identify as Indigenous themselves, some being previous recipients of the award. The judges are not just involved in choosing the recipients but are involved in shaping the prize as a whole, attending the event and connecting with prize recipients.

"Around 40 years ago, the Sahel, an extremely arid region located in central Africa, was an area of agricultural desolation. Due to natural factors such as heavy drought and interannual variability, combined with anthropocentric influences like climate change, overgrazing and deforestation, the environment has become particularly unstable with little possibility for productivity.  Furthermore, when rain does fall in the arid region, the soil is so dry due to a lack of precipitation, that water immediately ‘runs off’ or evaporates, failing to soak into the depleted earth. Some countries within the region, such as Burkina Faso, faced up to 24% of their arable lands classed as highly degraded in 1998 (Maatman et al., 1998).  In the early 2000s, NGOs and organisations such as the United Nations, the World Food Programme and WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), amongst others, sought to reverse the desertification of many parts of Africa, including the Sahel, in cooperation with farmers and communities from the affected regions. Using the ancient ‘half moon’ water harvesting technique – used for centuries in Africa and the Middle East, the revitalised technique aims to facilitate water retention and re-green the ecosystem. Heavy machinery or hand tools can be used to plough the soil roughly 30cm down in a semi-circle or ‘half moon’ shape. The diameter of these half moons are typically about 4 metres. When it rains, the contours catch the rainwater, preventing runoff and allowing it to infiltrate the soil. This creates ‘favourable micro-climate conditions’ allowing drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet to be planted.  If planted on steep slopes, half-moon ‘bunds’ can assist the growth of tree species. They can also be used in combination with controlled grazing to boost re-vegetation. In Niger, The World Food Programme (WFP) has been implementing half-moon planting projects since 2014. Just 5 years into the scheme, the benefits of its implementation were examined by a progress-review. In 2019, over 400 households had restored approximately 3,000 acres of land, largely for use in producing food for livestock. This has promoted social cohesion and economic growth by providing more jobs and stabilising agricultural output in a formerly capricious climate. This scenario exhibits the benefits of a localised, small-scale regenerative farming technique such as half-moon planting through its trickle-down effects, stipulating broader socio-economic growth. A study on the impact of reformed agroecological techniques was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Burkina Faso. Figures revealed that fields ploughed using the half-moon method saw the rates of increase for grain yield at 8% (The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 2017). As farmers sought new ways to boost crop yields, regenerative farming techniques such as the half-moon method were found to be successful when used in conjunction with others. In Burkina Faso, half-moon planting is exercised alongside the Zaï technique, which is useful when adapting to various soil types and structures. The Zaï method, suitable to the arid Sahel region, uses similar methods seen in the half-moons, but alternatively involves digging smaller pits in non-permeable soil to intercept water and gather compost material. These pits are slightly smaller than the half-moons and so are less labour intensive and can be utilised in smaller growing plots. They are roughly between 15-50cm across; 5-15cm deep; and positioned 80cm apart. This technique was reintroduced to the area in the 1980s by farmer and agronomist Yacouba Sawadogo, who pioneered the method of filling the holes with manure to further break up the earth and bolster soil productivity.

"Traditional Māori time systems were measured in accordance to the night as opposed to the Western proxy of daylight. Each night of the lunar month had a particular name and this cumulatively formed a lunar calendar known as ‘Maramataka‘. Farming according to the Maramataka lunar calendar is used in conjunction with Māori regenerative farming techniques to adapt to nature’s schedule as opposed to imposing controls on the earth’s processes. Many farmers are now seeking to turn back to these ancient methods in line with broader sustainability imperatives. Under the Maramataka calendar, individual lunar nights were marked according to how optimal they were for catching fish, eels or planting crops, with each night having its own name. A good example is eel fishing. It is not productive on a full moon – Rākaunui – because the moon’s light would not allow eel to hunt their prey, as the prey could see them. As with biodynamics (the Rudolf Steiner lunar approach for farming), planting crops is nest at a full moon, when the gravitational pull is at its highest, because it has maximum influence on water in the soil. “Despite the use of Maramataka being limited to a relative few today, largely because of colonisation, interest in and revival of this knowledge and practice is growing.”1 Many farmers are returning to the use of farming tactics such as Maramataka planting in line with broader regenerative goals. The Revitalise Te Taiao programme aims to fund sustainable and lucrative agribusiness solutions to cultivate Te Taiao (the natural world). This project provided $2.7 million in funding to Miru Young and Mohi Beckham, farmers based in the North Island’s Bay of Plenty, to trial agriculture techniques which aim to “enhance the mana and mauri of the soil” across 10 farm sites. As part of the scheme, both farmers undertook rigorous research, sowing pasture throughout different moon phases from resting and dormant phases to high-energy phases for plant growth. Soon, grass seeds sown during the high energy periods of the Maramataka calendar outgrew neighbouring crops planted in other phases, even if the latter had been sown 10 days before. Despite still being in the trial stages of Maramataka planting, Miru and Mohi observed various positive impacts of the scheme within the first few months. Their land has seen higher productivity and crop yields, with a 93% crop survival rate under Maramataka planting, that is an increase of 13% from the usual 80% under previous methods. One of the main issues associated with returning to traditional farming methods on a broader scale is competing with intensive methods in New Zealand’s modern agricultural industry. After settlers from the West arrived in New Zealand during the 18th and 19th centuries, intensive farming practices quickly became widespread.  As farming in the country has continuously expanded into the modern day, with agricultural exports making up a large proportion of the country’s GDP, traditional farming methods have become far less lucrative in the broader market. This meant that Māori farmers had to adopt newer techniques, as those trying to maintain the traditional methods were faced with far lower crop yields and income. Rural management programmes and sustainability objectives are constantly investigating new and feasible ways to rejuvenate te ao Māori farming techniques, with the Revitalise Te Taiao programme representing just one of many schemes. The Maramataka lunar calendar is part of a broader Maori worldview known as Mātauranga Māori – a term used to describe the collective knowledge of Māori living in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the knowledge passed down from their ancestors. Kaitiakitanga (stewardship/management) and the link between Whakapapa (Māori genealogy/ancestral descent) and Whenua (land) are key areas of te ao Māori and Mātauranga values.  By embracing schools of thought that are native to Aotearoa, alongside promoting equitable stewardship across modern farming methodologies, high agricultural output can be attained. Reforming the agribusiness in New Zealand will involve reintegrating Māori into decision making processes, embracing cross-cultural thought processes and utilising western technological advancements for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.

"Lammas is a celebration of the summer and the gathering in of the grain harvest. This was especially significant in the past. After all the hard work of getting the grain crop cut, threshed, stored and stacked, there came a time for feasting, celebration and assessment. Lammas is a Saxon name meaning ‘Loaf-mass’. Lughnasadh (pronounced Loo-nas-ah) is Irish Gaelic. On Lammas Eve fires were lit on Lammas mounds such as Silbury Hill at Avebury, to honour the Corn Mother as she gives birth to her harvest child, the Grain. This is the seed that will bring next year’s harvest as well as the grain that will sustain life throughout the winter. The month of August was the month of the Grain Mother. An ‘augur’ is an old word for seer and meant ‘increaser’. The great abundance of the Earth Mother is reflected in the titles she was given at this time: The Grain Mother, Barley Mother, Corn Mother, Demeter, Ceres, Cerealia, Grain, the Wise One of the Earth, the Increaser, She who is the seed, who is the womb, who is the soil, the Great Provider, the Preserver of Life. Cutting the ‘corn’ seems to be a general term for all cereal crops, whether they are wheat, barley, rye or oats. There were many customs and rituals throughout Europe to honour the first and the last sheaf of corn to be cut. The last sheaf was often cut by the youngest girl present and fashioned into a Corn Maiden. It was carried joyfully back to the village, sometimes plaited and decked with ribbons, and usually hung over the fireplace. Sometimes it was dressed in women’s clothes, and ritually burnt on the Lammas Fire. Sometimes these Corn Maidens were kept until Yule when they were divided up amongst the cattle or kept until the spring. Sometimes they were kept with the date tied to them. Many Corn Maidens would be seen hanging above the fireplace. In Scotland the ‘young maid’ was made out of the last stalks cut, and kept. The ‘old wife’ was made out of the first stalks cut and was passed on to the nearest farm that had not finished bringing in the corn. This was then passed round until it ended up at the last farm to be cut. Another old European custom was to weave the last sheaf into a large Corn Mother with a smaller corn doll inside it, representing next year’s unborn harvest. The regenerative power of the Earth is never more manifest than now as the grain harvest is gathered in and the Sun’s cycle begins to wane. The Cauldron of Regeneration was central to Celtic spiritual understanding. We are renewed by sleep and darkness, through many deaths and rebirths, and by the sacrifice of our outer lives for the inner journey. Here at Lammas, the doorway to the inner realms is opening. This is the symbolism behind the Demeter/Kore/Persephone story. Demeter, the Corn Mother, represents the ripe corn of this year’s harvest, and Kore or Persephone represents the grain-seed who lives in the dark throughout the winter and reappears in the Spring. Persephone’s descent into the Underworld is a mythical interpretation of the seed lying in the ground during the dark winter months, and her reappearance as the young maid, or the new sprouting seed, in the spring. This story shows us the Triple Goddess in all her aspects: as Earth Mother, the abundant provider; as the Crone, the wisdom found within; and as the Maiden who returns renewed in the spring. Pluto/Hades’ abduction of Persephone is a later reworking of this older myth. After all the manifest energy and activity of the early summer, it is good to make time now to rest and to assimilate all that has happened during the Sun’s active phase. Lammas celebrations would probably have begun with the cutting of the last sheaf of corn. Although the 2nd of August is the calendar date for Lammas, the great Lammas fairs and feasts would probably have lasted from mid July to mid August and would have peaked around the time of the harvest Full Moon. Once the grain had been safely gathered in and the men returned from their hunting trips, it was a time for feasting, dancing and merry-making, a great celebration of the first of the harvest and assessment of the year’s achievements. Beer, wine, cider and whisky made from the previous year’s harvest, were ritually drunk, celebrating the transformative power of Fire and Water. Cooking fires were honoured as they too embodied the power of Fire and Water. Bread was made from the new grain and thanks were given to the Sun’s life energy reborn as the bread of life. This is a busy time for harvesting herbs and collecting herb seeds to sow in the spring. Give thanks and blessings as you pick them, dry them and store them. Review what you know about them and ways you can use them both physically and metaphysically. Harvest sage at the end of July, before the flowers have come out. Sage is a herb associated with wisdom and releasing blocks in expression. It is connected to the throat chakra and is for those who have something to say but cannot let it out. It will help you express your emotions. Make the herb tea in the usual way. The infusion is a useful antiseptic herb for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers and mouth infections. It can be used as a gargle, for bathing wounds, sores, and to stop bleeding. Use the tea infusion externally and then drink afterwards as well. It will dry up excess secretions such as catarrh or sinusitis. It contains oestrogen and is useful in the menopause and for delayed menstruation. Burn dried sage to cleanse and purify. Waft the smoke around a person to cleanse their aura (called smudging). This is a good way to begin any ritual or ceremony. N.B. It must not be taken if pregnant, and because of its drying action, it must not be taken for long periods of time. It will dry up mother’s milk. Care must be taken by those who are insulin-dependent, and to be avoided by epileptics. Garlands of meadowsweet were traditionally worn for the Lammas celebrations. Its heady perfume expands the psyche, and builds inner strength. It enhances flexibility and connection to the inner levels. It is a mild sedative and painkiller containing salicylic acid (aspirin) that affects the rate at which blood clots. It is a good digestive tonic that reduces excess acidity and is useful for heartburn, hyperacidity, gastritis and peptic ulcers. As it cleanses the body of harmful acids, it is useful for any inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is a strong diuretic (increases urine) and can be used for any bladder or kidney complaint including cystitis. It reduces stagnation in the liver and therefore will help the immune system function more effectively. Its harvest time is July and August when the flowers are just beginning to open. Collect them in brown paper bags to dry for later use. N.B. Avoid if on anti-coagulant drugs. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Sacred Earth Celebrations, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"There are various methods for drying herbs for herbal recipes but they all require that the herb is dried and stored out of the light. I prefer to use brown paper bags, other people hang them up in bunches or lay them between sheets of newspaper or brown paper. • If using brown paper bags always label the bags with the name of the herb, the date and where you picked it. This is good practice and a good habit to get into as plants can change a lot in the drying process. Even if you think you will know what it is, it is surprising how you can forget, especially if you bag up several herbs over a period of a few weeks. • Leave the bags in a dry warm environment for several weeks. Put them in the airing cupboard if you have one, hang over the wood-burner or leave them on top of radiators. Shake the bags and turn the leaves over with your hands every day or two. It is essential to do this to stop any mould getting in to the herbs while they are still drying. • The herbal properties of leaves and flowers will deteriorate after 1 year so they need to be re-collected every year. Fruit, seeds, berries, roots and bark will last for 2 years. It is light that destroys the herbal properties of herbs, so at its simplest herbs can be stored all year in brown paper bags, although if they are kept in the kitchen they will need to be kept in a plastic container or airtight tin to keep them dry. Keeping the herbs in a dedicated leather or cotton bag is the traditional medicine way and these are hung somewhere warm and dry, near a radiator or fire. Putting them into dark glass jars is good in a kitchen because of the condensation. Clear jam jars are fine if they are kept in a dark cupboard. At its simplest the jar can be kept in a brown paper bag or more creative ways can be found. Herb teas vary in taste and quality. Buying popular blends as tea bags is convenient, but be aware that the herbs may be old by the time you drink them, and the herbs may have been grown in monocultures and sprayed with petrochemicals. It is infinitely better to make your own. • Making herb teas is not an exact science, especially when using the common safe plants. Interestingly, different herbalists use different amounts. I use about a teaspoonful of dried herbs or a small pile that fits into the hollow of my palm, and between a half to a pint of water, depending on the need. Use less for young children and anyone who is weak and frail. Dried herbs have twice the strength of fresh herbs, so twice the amount of fresh herb is used. • As you make the tea, say thank you to the plant. This open-hearted attitude adds to the healing process. I like to picture the plant and affirm its healing qualities as I wait for the tea to brew, partly to affirm the healing I am engaged in and also as a memory aid. This way I keep learning and understanding more about the plants all the time and keep my knowledge strong. Many of the herbs are an acquired taste. Nurture an openness to these wild flavours and earthy tastes and give them a chance. More often than not, a taste you didn’t like at first becomes a taste that you find you love. These are also for adults only as they are a mixture of brandy and honey. This makes them a most delicious way to take your medicine! They are especially good to use when travelling as they are kept in small dropper bottles and taken neat. Elixirs are combination remedies, created for specific uses and personal needs. Elixirs need to taste good so the addition of any aromatic herbs improves the flavour, but must also support the over-all herbal action. They are experimental and fun, as well as being extremely effective and I like to give them creative names. Write up everything in your Herb Journal. This is especially important when you make combination elixirs. Recording the plants and proportions used is invaluable when you create something you want to repeat. Method one 1. Half fill a dark jar with a herb or combinations of herbs: tear the leaves, crush the seeds or fruit, and chop the roots. Send your thanks to the plants. Add a little of something that will give it a nice flavour such as rose petals, sweet violet, lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena etc, making sure that their actions support the overall use of the remedy. 2. Cover the plant matter with clear runny honey and send your silent thanks to the bees. Poke well with a chopstick to get out any trapped air bubbles and break the plant matter up further. 3. Then top the jar up with brandy and 4. Put on the lid and label, date and shake well. Give it a poke and a shake frequently and keep out of bright light. They are ready in about a month, although they come to no harm if they are left longer. 5. Strain off the plant matter and rebottle in clean dark dropper bottles. Pour a little boiling water over the mash of herbs that are left over, getting every last bit of goodness out of them. Toast the plant and its medicine and have your first taste before returning the spent mash to the earth with thanks. Method two Create an instant elixir using the tinctures you have made. 1. Using a jug combine several tinctures that support the remedy you are making. 2. Mix in a similar amount of honey to tincture and mix the two together. 3. Pour into dark dropper bottles. Name and date and write up in your herb journal. Their dosage is similar to tinctures, although I tend to use them little and often. Here are some suggestions of plants to choose from, depending on what you have available. I have listed the native plants first and the aromatics at the end. Anti-stress elixir Hawthorn, cowslip, vervain, rose petals, lavender, borage. Drops of calm Hawthorn, elderflowers, cowslip, hops, valerian, vervain, rose petals, borage, lavender, chamomile. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Letting in the Wild Edges, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"Growing my own mulch has long been a goal of mine. We use a lot of mulch in the nursery and garden and at the moment I have no problem sourcing straw but if/when the day comes that the farmers start using their own straw to improve their soil (which is becoming a more common practice), I’ll be needing to step up my mulch growing efforts. Currently, I grow enough mulch to sustain my perennial beds and around 10% of my annual beds but rely on imported straw for mulching the other 90% of annual vegetable and nursery beds. My ideal mulch plant grows fast, is drought tolerant, competes minimally with crop plants, does not contain seed that easily spreads, is easy to handle and cut, i.e. not thorny/prickly or tough and fibrous, and can biodegrade relatively quickly (thereby returning the nutrients back to soil). I’ve broadly categorized the main sources of mulch we produce in our 1500m2 garden. Aquatic plants
I grow emergent wetland species such us cattails (Typha spp), sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) on the banks of a small pond (6m x 3m), and within a grey water reed bed (1m x 6m). The pond also provides suitable habitat for hornworts (Ceratophyllum spp). a submerged rootless perennial that gathers on the surface en masse. This plant makes an excellent mulch being rich in nitrogen, growing very fast and is easy to position around the base of plants. The emergent species provide a good thick carbon rich mulch that helps to reduce evaporation on the terrestrial beds and I cut these back in the spring in case they are used for overwintering invertebrates. Aquatic plants are an excellent source of mulch as there are no issues with seed germinating amongst your land based crops. Tap rooted perennial / biennials
Deep rooted perennial plants tend to produce a good amount of biomass, are generally drought tolerant and do not compete strongly with our crop plants. I have found native biennial weeds such as greater burdock (Arctium lappa), a very useful mulch plant with the gigantic leaves growing back very fast after a cut. Lesser burdock (Arctium minus), is also useful albeit to lesser extent. Although biennial, if you cut back these plants before flowering you can prolong their life, harvesting good quantities of seed free biomass. I do eventually allow some of the plants to flower and they are much loved by bees among other insects. Comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum), ‘bocking 14’, is a classic example of a deep rooted mulch plant. We have the plant scattered throughout the garden and planted in dedicated patches. The plants do require irrigation however and will only provide good leaf yields if grown on fertile soil. Peeing on the plants is recommended. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), provide a great source of biomass. For a good tuber harvest it’s best to wait until the end of the season before harvesting the mulch. We can never consume as much as we produce of these tubers in the kitchen. I have found them to be much appreciated by our pigs and an excellent source of fresh winter food for our rabbits. Leaves of greater burdock (Arctium lappa) Nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs 
These plants take a while to establish but make an excellent contribution. I’ve had good results from coppicing empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), when they are 3-years-old and chop and dropping the soft new growth three or four times a year. I am expecting to also see good results from grey alder (Alnus incana) and Italian alder (Alnus cordata). I avoid using thorny nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs for this purpose. Annual trimming of shrubs such as autumn olive – Elaeagnus umbellata and broom – Cytisus scoparius also provides good quantities of mulch. Click here for more info on nitrogen fixing plants. Lawn and ground cover
One of my favourite sources of mulch is lawn trimmings. They are great for mulching potted plants or applying a mulch into tight spots. Mixed species lawns will contain a more diverse mix of mineral nutrients. Lawns including a legume such as white clover (Trifolim repens), can provide a nitrogen rich mulch. It’s a good idea to leave some of the trimmings behind to keep the lawn healthy. Autumn leaf fall and herbaceous stem residue
The annual shedding of leaves from trees and shrubs in our garden make a great contribution to our mulch capital. Leaves can be cleared from paths, lawns and wildflower beds (as they will disrupt the growth in these areas) and concentrated where they are of benefit such as the base of high demanding fruiting shrubs such as blackcurrants or blackberries. Herbaceous perennials such as lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis) and mints (Mentha spp). will provide dead stems annually. It’s always a good idea to leave hollow stems of some herbaceous perennials to remain for the winter as they are utilized by invertebrates for egg laying and hibernating. If the plant does not have a hollow stem it can be cut back and used for mulch. Fennel (Foeniculm vulgare), provides large quantities of biomass and as far as I can tell the stems are not utilised by any organism over the winter. In the vegetable garden all the remnants of my crops after harvesting go straight back to the surface for recycling. Foeniculum vulgare and other herbaceous perennials Tree prunings
Woody prunings from shrubs, trees and vines cut into small pieces (5-10cm) make good mulch in the mature areas of the forest garden with well established fungal soils specializing in breaking down the lignified woody material. Living mulches 
In the more mature areas of the garden where the trees have established (5yrs and older) I have dispensed with mulch all together in favour of ground cover plants that can be considered living mulches. Some the most successful perennial living mulches I have found that form good dense cover in the shade include bugle (Ajuga reptans), spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), Caucasian stonecrop (Sedem spurium), perwinkle (Vinca major) and betony (Stachys officinalis). Lamium maculatum spreading well under a mullbery (Morus alba) Scaling up mulch production
In order to grow enough mulch to provide a water retaining, weed excluding barrier for my annual and nursery beds I would certainly need more space. A larger wetland area would be ideal, with aquatic species growing very fast and the seed bearing parts of the plants being non problematic to use on terrestrial beds. If you don’t have a reliable aquatic habitat, the next best option for growing quantities of mulch without irrigation and fertilization is probably grass. During my next post I’ll be sharing a plan where using the lessons garnered from small scale systems, we’ll be growing mulch to support approx 670 fruit trees and 1360 soft fruit shrubs on a 5ha Agroforestry Project (design layout below).

"There are many medicinal uses for elder – Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae family). It is an evocative tree, steeped in history, tradition, and folklore. This is one of our great food and medicinal plants, easily found in most areas of the British Isles where people have settled. It’s botanical name, Sambucus nigra, stems from the Greek word sambuke; a ‘musical pipe’, due to its hollow form supplying our ancestors a perfect wood for making pipes. The Latin ‘nigra’, means black, in allusion to the dark colour of ripe elder berry fruit. Elder is a deciduous woodland and hedgerow plant, native to Northern Europe and North America, and can be seen happily growing on most types of soil up to altitudes of approximately 470m. Superstition says to not cut elder down or burn them. This may be purely because of the toxic fumes which rise from burning elder wood, or it may be that the faeries will be really upset because you are destroying such a useful plant! Other legends have grown around this plant, such as that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who allegedly betrayed Jesus to the Romans, then said to have hanged himself from its branches. This story gave rise to the name of the edible fungus found all year round on the elder – the Jelly Ear. Elder can sometimes be found growing as a shrubby form, and sometimes like a tree on a single trunk, similar to other woodland-edge plants like hazel, hawthorn and blackthorn. A mature elder typically displays a domed crown, and will be spotted from a distance once you know it. Elders can reach 8m or more, although more commonly 5-6m or so, because of other limiting environmental factors. Ideally the plant likes a rich and damp soil in a sunny position. Elder does not like exposed sites or windy hillsides. The branches display numerous lenticels (air holes) and produce their stems with opposite pairs of buds. The buds are naked, without bud scales. The light brown, corky bark pattern on elder can appear quite similar to the invasive exotic, the ‘butterfly bush’ – Buddleja davidii. The similarity between Sambucus and Buddleja ends there. Elder’s leaves are completely different in form. They are compound, comprising of seven oval, serrated leaflets, each being about 7-10cm long. The leaflets typically come in two or three opposite pairs with one terminal leaflet. They are a much lighter green colour than the Himalayan native ‘butterfly bush’ which has a simple, lanceolate / elliptical leaf. You will find this year’s flowers and fruits on last year’s growth. The umbel-like elderflowers, (technically corymbs), are borne on terminal stems. Five creamy-white petals surround the yellow anthers. When ripe, and picked on a sunny day, are bursting with pollen and scent, and should be a bright lemon-yellow. They turn brown when past their best. Only pick ripe flowers! The flowers have a small amount of natural yeast on them which assists fermentation when making drinks. This will be testified by anyone who makes the superb thirst quenching elderflower champagne! The rank smell of elder leaves or the gone-over flowers is known to repel many who come across it, often being described as a cat urine smell!  After a short but sweet period in full bloom, the flowers give rise to upstanding clusters of small berries, which are typically no bigger than 10mm in diameter. Initially green, the berries gradually begin to nod earthwards as they ripen. At the end of the summer they are dark purple – with many medicinal uses. Parts used Flowers, berries, leaves, bark, fungi. Harvest time The flowers are picked when in full bloom. The berries are picked when ripe in the autumn. Key active medicinal constituents Tannins, potassium, mucilage, phenols, triterpenes, sterols, lectins, flavonoids (including rutin). The dark coloured berries are rich in anthocyanins, folic acid and vitamins A and C. They also contain flavonoids, and cyanidin glucosides, which are poisonous in large doses.  Medicinal actions Diaphoretic, febrifuge, anti-catarrhal, anti viral, immuno-supportive. Uses – Elderflowers and berries are expectorant and diaphoretic, thus they help to manage and reduce fevers and to rid the body of toxins. – Elderflowers are also anti-viral and are useful in combating herpes simplex type 1 virus (responsible for cold sores). – The flowers can be made into champagne, cordials, wine, sorbet, jam and fritters. – Elderberry extract has been proven to inhibit various strains of flu, especially if taken early enough. Many people can testify that elder can significantly reduce recovery times from influenza. – Some books have stated the ripe berries are poisonous, but this is slightly misleading. They will cause gastric upset if you eat a large quantity raw, (as will too many apples while scrumping) but in small amounts they should present no problem. Cooked into jams, syrups etc., larger quantities of elderberries are absolutely fine. – Pioneering contemporary forager-chefs have rediscovered that even the green berries can be used, as ‘capers’, if prepared correctly. This involves fermenting the berries in a salt brine solution for a few days, similar to preparing green walnuts for pickling, and then covering in a flavoured vinegar. – Even when the tree is dormant in the winter, it is still possible to harvest food! The ‘Jelly ear’ fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is often found on elder, dead or alive. Known as a delicacy in China, it is best cooked sliced into thin strips, in a spicy, oriental-style soup.

"There’s a plethora of info out there about comfrey but not much detail regarding establishing and managing a comfrey patch so I thought I would write an article to share my experience on this and how we grow comfrey as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden. A member of the borage family, comfrey – Symphytum spp. is native to Europe and Asia and there are 40 recorded species throughout that region. The plant most commonly referred to and used in gardens is Russian comfrey – Symphytum x uplandicum, a naturally occurring hybrid of two wild species: common comfrey – Symphytum officinale and prickly comfrey – Symphytum asperum. A few centuries back, the hybrid Symphytum x uplandicum came to the attention of Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) and he widely promoted the plant as a food and forage crop. Years later, and after two world wars, Lawrence D Hills (1911-1991) would continue Henry Doubleday’s Comfrey crusade. In the 1950s, Hills developed a comfrey research program in the village of Bocking, near Braintree in the UK. The original trial site is on the plot of land now occupied by the Doubleday Gardens housing development. Lawrence Hills lived at 20 Convent Lane just around the corner of the trial site. At this site, Hills trialed at least 21 comfrey ‘strains’, each one named after the village Bocking. Strain 14 was identified as being the most nutrient rich, non-seeding strain and ‘Bocking 14’ began its journey into gardens far and wide across the world. (Learn more its history on the Balkan Ecology Project blog.) Medicinal – Comfrey has been cultivated as a healing herb since at least 400BC. The Greeks and Romans commonly used comfrey to stop heavy bleeding, treat bronchial problems and heal wounds and broken bones. Poultices were made for external wounds and tea was consumed for internal ailments. Comfrey has been reported to promote healthy skin with its mucilage content that moisturizes and soothes and promotes cell proliferation. This plant is my first port of call if ever I need to dress a wound. Simply take a few leaves brush them together to remove the hairs and wrap them around the wound and apply light pressure. It’s incredibly effective at stopping the bleeding, reducing the pain and healing the wound. Biomas – Comfrey produces large amounts of foliage from late May (late spring) until hard frosts in October or November (late autumn). The plant is excellent for producing mulch and can be cut from 2-5 times per year depending on how well the plants are watered and fed. The plant grows rapidly after each harvest. In our gardens we have Comfrey ‘Bocking 14’ located next to each fruit tree in order to have a renewable source of mulch just where we need it. We also grow in patches as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden and have patches in the wildflower meadows (details below). We’ve supplied 1,000 ‘Bocking 14’ cuttings to Oxygenisis, a business in Germany who are experimenting with using this plant for carbon capture. Mineral dam – Comfrey has deep roots of up to 2m that utilize nutrients deep in the subsoil that would otherwise wash away with the underground soil water or remain inaccessible to other plants. The nutrients, once taken up from the roots, are relocated throughout the plant as and where needed with some of them ending up in the comfrey leaf mass. When cutting the leaf mass and applying to the soil surface, the mined nutrients are returned and again made accessible to shallower rooted crop plants.  Biodiversity – The bell shaped flowers provide nectar and pollen to many species of bees and other insects from late May until the first frosts in late autumn. Lacewings are said to lay eggs on comfrey and spiders overwinter on the plant. Parasitoid wasps and spiders will hunt on and around comfrey. Pest and disease prevention and control – Research indicates that a comfrey solution can be used to prevent powdery mildew. Pest predators such as spiders, lacewings and parasatoid wasps associate with this plant. It’s best to leave some plants alone in order to sustain pest predator relationships. Ground cover – Some species can quickly spread to form a thick ground cover and work particularly well for ground cover on the sunny side under shrubs and trees. Symphytum tuberosum – Tuberous Comfrey seems to be the best species for this.  Fertilizer – Comfrey leaves contain a great balance of major plant nutrients (N,P,K) and can be fed to plants as powder, direct mulch or by steeping chopped comfrey leaves in water for several weeks to produce a thick, dark liquid that can be diluted with water and applied to plant roots. More on this below. Nutritional value of comfrey – You can see from the below table that wilted comfrey contains significantly higher quantities of potash compared to other organic fertilizers. It’s well recorded that comfrey is an excellent source of potassium (K) a major plant nutrient that is required by plants in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction. Animal fodder – Comfrey has a long history for use as an animal feed. Lawrence D Hills dedicated books to this topic.* The leaves are best received by animals wilted. Fresh leaves can be eaten by pigs, sheep, and poultry but cattle, rabbits and horses will only consume wilted leaves. Human consumption – Symphytum officianale and Symphytum x uplandicum are both reported to be used for salad and potherb and are best when cooked. Personally I’m not keen on the texture but will have the occasional nibble from the garden using the new growth to mix in a spring green salad. Caution – Although comfrey has been used as a food crop, in the past 20 years scientific studies reported that comfrey may be carcinogenic, since it appeared to cause liver damage and cancerous tumors in rats. These reports have temporarily restricted development of comfrey as a food crop. In light of this, the regular consumption of comfrey is not advisable.  Life cycle – Herbaceous perennial Growth habit – Comfrey begins growth in early-April and by early May compact clusters of young leaves are visible in the crown of the old plant. Within a few weeks, the leaf blades with long petioles have grown to over 35cm high. Basal leaves are large, lance-shaped, stalked, and coarsely hairy. The leaves die back following the first frost and remain dormant for winter. Many species can spread vigorously via seed and are generally not welcome in the garden because of this. Other species can spread via tubers and all species quickly regenerate from broken root pieces.  Flowering – Starts in late May or early June and continues until the first frost in late autumn. The bell-shaped flowers with pedicels are in terminal cymes or one-sided clusters. Flowers of common comfrey are usually creamy yellow, but white, red, or purple types have been found in Europe. Prickly comfrey has pink and blue flowers while Russian comfrey has blue, purple, or red-purple flowers. Tuberous comfrey has creamy white flowers. Vegetative growth does not cease with the start of flowering, and the plant will add new stems continuously during the growing season. Most comfrey plants can be somewhat invasive, spreading via seed to parts of the garden where they are not wanted. ‘Bocking 14’ will flower and provide nectar and pollen but will not produce viable seed. Roots – Some species have short, thick, tuberous roots such as Symphytum tuberosum. Others such as Symphytum x uplandicum have deep and expansive root systems. Light – Needs full sun for good biomass production but grows fine in the shade. Shade – Tolerates light shade (about 50%). Moisture – Some species are drought tolerant e.g. Symphytum tuberosum. Cultivated plants require irrigation. USDA Hardiness Zone – 4-9 comfrey crowns and roots are very winter hardy.  Soil – Comfrey is adaptable to many soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils.  pH – Tolerates a wide range (6.5-8.5), although not very sensitive to soil pH, highest yields are reported to occur on soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Perhaps you’re interested in growing comfrey to feed your animals, for medicine, for mulch, for compost or you’re slightly masochistic and want to roll around naked in the pricky beds of biomass (not me). In any case, here’s how to do it. The plant we use in our gardens is Symphytum x uplandicum – ‘Bocking 14’. A sterile cultivar that produces copious quantities of nutrient dense biomass. The following information is based on using this plant.  Choosing the site – We’re growing for biomass and want the plants to receive as much light as possible. Accordingly, we lay out our beds on an east to west axis (we’re in the northern hemisphere).  Irrigation is necessary if you want to get good yields from the plants so picking a place with access to irrigation is of paramount important.  In areas of low rainfall, using the gradient of the land to channel precipitation towards your beds will reduce the water needs of your plants. In areas of high rainfall with a high water table you should consider diverting water away from the beds. Once established, comfrey is difficult to get rid of, so choose a site where you want it to stay. Don’t plant comfrey in any area you cultivate, as the broken root pieces quickly establish into new plants and can out compete slower growing crops.  Position comfrey downhill from where you expect leachate to be present, i.e downhill from a manure pile , compost heap, outside toilet, animal pen etc., can provide passive fertility to the plants and rescue otherwise lost minerals from draining away with the sub soil ground water. 
Grow the comfrey where you want to use it. As you’ll see later we may be harvesting over 1/4 ton biomass from our patch and don’t want to be carrying that over long distances. Preparing the site – Raised beds are a major part of our fertility strategy and overtime retain water and nutrients very efficiently. I use 1.3m wide beds surrounded by 50cm paths for our crops as this allows easy access for harvesting everywhere in the beds without ever having to tread on the soil and the paths are wise enough to take our lawnmower. To form a bed, the area should be cleared of all plants, which is best achieved by sheet mulching the season before. Pernicious perennials or tap rooted biennials should be dug out. After you have cleared the whole area, mark out the bed shape with string and dig out 50cm wide paths around your beds, applying the soil to the surface of the planting area and thereby creating the initial rise of the bed. Fork over the beds well. If a hardpan is present take the time and effort to eliminate it before planting. Depending on the quality of your soil you may want to add extra compost before planting into the bed. If you have sheet mulched the area before hand, with the additional soil from the paths all you need to do is add a good 20cm thick straw mulch (or some other mulch) and it’s ready for planting. A good mulch to start with will help keep the weeds down while your comfrey gets going. You can alter the depth and gradient of the paths to facilitate the required direction of water movement. Planting material – You can plant out with crown divisions or root cuttings best done in the spring when the soil has warmed. A crown division can be obtained from simply putting a spade through the center of a mature comfrey plant and transplanting the divided sections. For our beds, I divided two year old plants into quarters, sometimes sixths, and these established very well in the first year. It’s bests not to harvest the leaf biomass in the first year in order to allow a deep root system to develop. However if you use large divisions you can start harvesting in July. Root cuttings are a great way to plant out large areas of comfrey. The cuttings should be grown on in small pots with 50% compost 50% river sand mix kept moist and planted out in the spring as soon as the first leaves emerge and the soil has warmed. If you are planting large numbers of root cuttings you can plant directly into the beds by creating ‘nests’ in the straw, adding two cupped handfuls of the above mentioned potting mix and plant the cuttings into this. Keep them moist like a wrung out sponge and the success rate will be very close to 100%. Spacing – The plants should be spaced 60cm apart in rows and 60cm apart at diagonals between rows. Plant the rows 15cm from the edge of the beds. Cutting – In the first year allow the plants to establish so that the roots develop well and penetrate deep into the subsoil. Remove any weeds around the plants leaving them on the surface. The following year the cutting can begin. You can scythe the beds for a quick harvest or cut each plant individually with a pair of secateurs or shears cutting to 5cm or so from ground level. The leaves are prickly so if you have sensitive hands wear gloves. Cut the comfrey as the flowering stalks emerge up to four times a year. Allow the plants to flower at least once during the season to provide bee fodder to a range of native bees and honey bees. Leave the last flush of leaves before the winter so that invertebrates can find winter shelter in the undergrowth. You may need to weed between cuts every now and then but generally the comfrey will quickly cover the surface. Feeding – After you have cut the comfrey, mow the pathways between the beds and empty the trimmings to the base of the comfrey plants. Any trimmings from lawns and hedges in the surrounding area can also be used. We are experimenting with growing nitrogen fixing hedging and ground cover plants adjacent to the patch in order to feed our comfrey. A most excellent comfrey feed is undiluted urine applied at a rate of approx 500 ml per plant twice per growing season. Irrigation – Comfrey will produce more biomass if irrigated and in dry climates it’s essential to irrigate. Comfrey plants wilt very fast in hot conditions and will stop photosynthesising at this point. Twenty litres per m2 per week of drought should be more than adequate. The beauty of biological systems are that, if managed properly, each year the soils improve and the ability of the soil to store water will improve over time. We use passive irrigation diverting water from a mountain stream into the paths around the beds. The paths fill with water, we raise the level by blocking the low points with sacks of sawdust and the water is drawn throughout the soil via capillary action. Passive irrigation in our market garden. The paths fill with water and the water permeates throughout the soil via capillary action. As mulch – Freshly cut comfrey leaves make good mulch because they have high nitrogen content, and don’t pull nitrogen from the soil while decomposing. Comfrey’s high potassium content makes it especially beneficial for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, berries, and fruit trees. With adequate feed and watering we’ve seen yields of 2-3kg of biomass per plant per cut. Comfrey beds establishing well. This bed was planted with divided crowns 5 months prior to this photo being taken. Liquid fertliser – What I like to call ‘Comfert’. Fill a barrel, preferably with a bottom tap and a gauze on the inside (to prevent clogging) about 3/4 full with freshly cut comfrey and add water to fill the barrel. Cover it, and let it steep for 3-6 weeks. The smell from the resulting liquid is far from attractive so approach with caution. The tea may be used full strength or diluted by half or more. Don’t apply before heavy rain is forecast as most of the nutrients suspended in the liquid will wash straight through the soil. For the best results apply the feed to your vegetables when they are in most need of the extra fertility. This will be different for each crop, for example, tomatoes are best fed when they are setting fruit and then any time during the fruiting period. Applying comfert before this can be counter productive and make your plants more susceptible to pest problems. The black slurry at the bottom of the barrel can be dispersed evenly back over the comfrey patch. Liquid fertilizer concentrate – ‘Comfert Plus’ can also be made by packing fresh-cut comfrey tops into an old bucket, weighing them down with something heavy, covering tightly, and waiting a few weeks for them to decompose into a black slurry. You can put a hole in the bottom of the bucket and collect the concentrate in another container as it drips out. Dilute this comfrey concentrate about 15 to 1 with water, and use as you would comfert. You can seal this concentrate in plastic jugs until you are ready to use it. Warning! Comfert stinks like hell. My nieces came to visit from London last year and offered to help out in the market garden. One of the tasks that day was to apply comfert to the crops. Let’s just say it did not end well and we had a much better experience taking softwood cuttings the next day. According to Martin Crawford in Creating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops, one cut of comfrey from one plant contains 0.5g of Nitrogen (N) and 10g of potassium (K) to crops. Based on this I calculated how much Potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and biomass the 13 m2 comfrey patch can potentially produce in a year. Below is a table indicating how many comfrey cuts are needed to meet the Nitrogen and Potassium needs of various moderate and heavy cropping fruit and nut trees and annual vegetables. In the 1960s, Lawrence D. Hills used UK gardeners records for a comfrey report. (See the Balkan Ecology Project blog for the results.) Based on these records I calculated a yield of approx. 5.5kg of biomass per plant each year. Using this figure one of our beds should produce approx 286kg of biomass. We shall see as this year we begin our own records. We’re looking to gather some solid data on how comfrey performs in our climate and we’ll be recording the yields from our patch starting this season and for at least the next five years. For more info on our record keeping and research programs see Polyculture Market Garden Study. If you would like to join the ‘who can grow the most comfrey’ experiment and contribute data to our records, send us an email. It will be great to have records from all over the world.

"Hugelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, means hill culture or hill mound. Instead of putting branches, leaves and grass clippings in bags by the curbside for the bin men… build a hugel bed. Simply mound logs, branches, leaves, grass clippings, straw, cardboard, petroleum-free newspaper, manure, compost or whatever other biomass you have available, top with soil and plant your veggies. The advantages of a hugel bed are many, including: The gradual decay of wood is a consistent source of long-term nutrients for the plants. A large bed might give out a constant supply of nutrients for 20 years (or even longer if you use only hardwoods). The composting wood also generates heat which should extend the growing season. Soil aeration increases as those branches and logs break down… meaning the bed will be no till, long term. The logs and branches act like a sponge. Rainwater is stored and then released during drier times. Actually you may never need to water your hugel bed again after the first year (except during long term droughts). Sequester carbon into the soil. On a sod lawn Sepp Holzer (hugelkultur expert) recommends cutting out the sod, digging a one foot deep trench and filling the trench with logs and branches. Then cover the logs with the upside down turf. On top of the turf add grass clippings, seaweed, compost, aged manure, straw, green leaves, mulch, etc…  Sepp Holzer recommends steep hugel beds to avoid compaction from increased pressure over time. Steep beds mean more surface area in your garden for plants and the height makes easy harvesting. The greater the mass, the greater the water-retention benefits. Hugel bed dug in clay with logs put in vertically, next branches and lots of wood chips. Top 6 inches will be wood chips and dirt. This bed will store water and give nutrients for many years to come. Straw bale gardens require less soil, less water and hold heat. As the straw breaks down nutrients feed the plants. Combining a straw surround with a hugel interior, topped by lasagne layering is an excellent idea for an area with poor quality soil. Hugel bed in Ontario, Canada (June 28th) by Tim Burrows. Tim surrounded his very tall hugel bed in pallets! Sheet mulching (lasagne gardening) is like composting in place. Above: just a suggestion as to sheet mulching layers. Nitrogen-rich material such as fresh grass clippings or green leaves put right on the hugelkultur wood would help jump start the composting process. Could also include seaweed, straw, dead leaves, leaf mould, etc.

The first year of break down means the wood (and fungi) steal a lot of the nitrogen out of the surrounding environment, so adding nitrogen during the first year or planting crops that add nitrogen to the soil (like legumes) or planting species with minimal nitrogen requirements is necessary, unless there is plenty of organic material on top of the wood. After the wood absorbs nitrogen to its fill, the wood will start to break down and start to give nitrogen back in the process. In the end you will be left with a beautiful bed of nutrient rich soil. Tree types that work well in hugelkultur:
Hardwoods break down slowly and therefore your hugel bed will last longer, hold water for more years and add nutrients for more years. But softwoods are acceptable as well, a softwood bed will just disintegrate quicker. Mixing woods with softwoods and branches on top, to give off nutrients first, and hardwoods on bottom, sounds like a plan if you have access to multiple types of wood. Yet the newly decomposing softwoods at the top will eat up a lot of nitrogen at first, so compensate for that.

Woods that work best:
Alders, apple, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, oak, poplar, willow (make sure it is dead or it will sprout).

Trees types that work okay:
Black cherry (use only rotted), camphor wood (well aged), cedar/juniper/yew (anti-microbial/anti-fungal, so use only at very bottom or unless already well-aged. Cedar should be broken down before new plant roots reach it), eucalyptus (slightly anti-microbial), osage orange (exceptionally resistant to decay), Pacific yew (exceptionally resistant to decay), pine/fir/spruce (tannins and sap), red mulberry (exceptionally resistant to decay).

Tree types to avoid:
Black locust (will not decompose), black walnut (juglone toxin), old growth redwood (heartwood will not decompose and redwood compost can prevent seed germination).

"Thistles are a bane of picnickers and campers. Who hasn’t trodden on the sharp, unforgiving spines of a thistle when out and about barefoot in grasslands? For many people, relationships with thistles have generally been painful and irritable, but now you can get your own back! One of the great things about thistles is that every single species is edible, so this is great news for foraging beginners! Even the closest lookalikes found here are edible – the sow thistles (Sonchus spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), so when working with the thistles, you can learn to identify and proceed to experiment with complete confidence from the outset. We have at least 14 species of thistle growing wild in the UK, mostly from the Cirsium (aka plume thistles) and Carduus genera. Thistles are found in numerous settings all over our islands and can be a useful soil barometer. Often their presence signifies that the land is fertile, and in many instances, neglected. I eat from a number of different species. These are: creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis), spear thistle (C. vulgare), woolly thistle (C. eriophorum), marsh thistle (C. palustris), and welted thistle (Carduus acanthoides syn C. crispus). As you will discover, plants that have spines to offer protection against predators, have no real need for bitterness. Spear thistle It’s almost impossible to misidentify a thistle. One of the easy-to-spot botanical differences between thistles and their numerous relatives in the daisy family, is that the overlapping bracts (involucre) found directly below the flowers of thistles, are always spiny. Simple! The leaves of the numerous species will differ in size, shape and the density of spine coverage. Most have stiff spines on the margins, but some have soft prickles. You need to discover for yourself which are the more tactile! When in flower, most thistles produce a lovely purple / mauve bloom, but some species are known for their yellow inflorescence (cabbage thistle – Cirsium oleraceum and the Carline thistle – Carlina vulgaris). In all of the thistles, flowers give way to copious amounts of fluffy hairs (pappus) attached to their tiny fruits, superbly designed for air-borne dispersal. A distinguishing feature between the two main generais that Cirsium spp. produce feathered pappus hairs, whereas Carduus spp. only have simple pappus hairs. Creeping thistle produces dense spines on its leaves, but very few spines or hairs on the flowering stems. Spear thistle has large, deeply-lobed leaves with large spines at the margins, as well as hairy, spiny stems. Marsh thistle looks somewhat like spear thistle at an initial glance, but without the large spines and leaf lobes, and usually with a thin, red, leaf margin. Woolly thistle is easily identifiable with large, deeply-lobed, evenly-shaped leaves, and very large flower heads, wrapped in a ‘cobweb’ of cotton-like hairs. This particular species is the largest wild thistle I use, although if you have milk thistle (Silybum marianum) growing in your plot, you can use that too, but you will need good gloves to protect yourself from its long spiny flower heads! Eating milk thistle chokes would of course prevent you harvesting the exceptional liver-supportive medicine found in the seeds. Wooly thistle Creeping thistle will grow in all manner of waste-ground, grasslands, verges and field edges. I also see a lot of spear thistle in similar habitats, although when found in grassland, it’s not as abundant as the creeping species. The root systems explain why; spear thistle has a tap root, whereas creeping thistle grows on rhizomes. The marsh thistle, as its name alludes to, likes damp conditions such as fens, marshes, canal tow-paths and riversides. Woolly thistle is a little bit more selective in its choice of soil and setting, preferring calcareous ground. It too enjoys grasslands. Welted thistle can be found all over the UK, especially loving clay soils. Go prepared! Stiff gloves and a knife are required. Harvest the best leaf mid-ribs in spring when growth is plentiful and quick. Your specimens will be tender and sweeter. Flowering stems will appear from late spring through into autumn. I only consider harvesting from plants whose flower buds are yet to really begin unfurling. Flower buds (chokes) are available all summer. In Portugal, a number of thistle species are still collected in spring and sold at markets. A recent academic study highlighted the nutritional value from eating thistles. The findings are contained within ‘Ethnobotany In The New Europe’ by Manuel. P de Santayana et al. (Eds), published June 2010. In the study, researchers noted the wide range of thistle species collected, and concentrated on the nutritional value of one particular thistle (Scolymus hispanicus – Spanish or golden thistle). This plant is collected by villagers in various areas of the countryside. Bunches of the stripped leaf mid-ribs are sold and bought in a number of markets in different areas. Levels of certain nutrients were analysed and compared to some commonly consumed vegetables. Their findings show that the thistle contained consistently higher levels of important major nutrients than some of our commonly consumed cultivated vegetables. Weight for weight, thistles come out higher in fibre, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc and other nutrients. Is it likely that the thistles found wild here will be similarly endowed with a range of important vitamins and minerals? I’m more than happy to work on the assumption that this will be the case. Many other wild plant species are known to contain high concentrations of important nutrients. Preparing thistles is pretty easy. Simply choose the most tender specimens. If using the petioles, then cut and strip all the spines off, before peeling the outer, fibrous layer from the stalk. Use raw as crudités, pickle or ferment them, or chop into salads and serve them with a tangy vinaigrette. If cooking, they don’t require long! Preparing the stems is similar, but they are hollow. These can be used in similar ways to the petioles, or you can stuff them, roast them, and braise them. As relatives of the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), thistles produce edible, if smaller, ‘chokes’. These are the crunchy, immature bases, or capitulum, of the composite flower-head. As you would do with globe artichokes, peel away the bracts to get to the prize. I only choose the largest wild species for this. Happy foraging!

"Some plants seem to be our constant companions, no matter where we live. Often, they will also be some of our really useful species. It will soon become clear that the common mallow (Malva sylvestris) is one of these plants. Rather than being looked upon as a weed, the mallows can be more usefully described as some of our gloriously abundant plant helpers. A number of mallow species have long been used as a food and medicine, wherever they are found native, and especially in the Middle East and Asia. You won’t have far to go to find the common mallow in most parts of Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia either. Common mallow can be found growing erect or prostrate, which may initially cause confusion because it’s easy to assume they might be two different species. Mallow’s kidney-shaped or palmately-lobed leaves are notably creased, typically with dentate margins. The leaves often show a purple spot in the centre of the base of the leaf and this can also be seen to run down the petiole on some specimens. On other specimens, the purple spotting and colouring is completely absent. Mallow leaves have long petioles. Their deep green foliage hints at a renowned drought tolerance. During flowering, the leaves appear alternately on the stems. Holding a leaf relays the surface coarseness. But tear and crush one, and you discover a family pattern – the mucilage. You will soon experience a slimy and tacky feel between your fingers. All parts of the plant contain mucilage. In bloom, the Malvaceae family plants produce five large notched petals in each open flower. Common mallow has showy pink petals laced with darker-coloured strokes. In the centre of the flower lies a pollen-loaded column of fused stamens. This surrounds the stigma, which rises above the column.  Mallow is known to freely seed. The round seed pods, known as ‘cheeses’, soon follow flowering. These were once munched by children on their way to and from school. The pods are held on stalks, close to the flowering stem. Mallow will be found on most soils, from coastal to marginally upland habitats, with most settings being adequate for this resilient plant. It loves waste-ground as well as grassland; gravel as much as coastal edges, and waysides and roadsides as well as hedges.  Leaves, flowers, seed pods, roots. Leaves, in spring; flowers from late spring; seed pods from early summer. Roots could be harvested from larger rosettes whenever large enough. Medicinal and nutritional constituents Vitamins A,B,C,E; inulin; mucilage; phenols; flavonoids; essential fatty acids; fibre; calcium; magnesium; zinc; selenium; potassium. Traditional and contemporary uses As with many wild food plants, the common mallow has also had a long history of medicinal use. Due to its high mucilage content, mallows make excellent soothing demulcent herbs, especially for cases of inflammation, either for the urinary, digestive or respiratory systems. Pregnant women or new mothers may like to know that mallow leaves can provide useful amounts of iron, as well as being quite high in zinc and most vitamins.  All of the mallow family with exception to the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum), are reportedly edible. With their high mucilage content, the leaves can usefully be taken as an emergency antidote to irritation or burning that may be caused by the accidental consumption of acrid plants in the buttercup family. Creative cooks can substitute mallow for spinach in many dishes, including soups, salads, gnocchi and quiche. I have even flash-fried larger mallow leaves for just one second in hot oil to make ‘popadoms’. Mallow also makes a great addition to soups, whereby the mucilage helps to thicken them.  In Jewish culture, mallow has been been considered the ‘most important plant in local gather society’. Every spring mallow is gathered in the countryside. Its common name in both Hebrew and Arabic, translates to ‘bread’.  During the war of 1948, when Jerusalem was under siege, mallow was an important famine crop, and one that is still celebrated on Independence day every year with a traditional dish made from mallow leaves. Common mallow can be substituted for the family relative Corchorus olitorius aka ‘jutes mallow’, when making the Egyptian / Middle-Eastern dish ‘Molokhia’. This traditional dish is usually served with chicken.  In China, mallow roots are a popular and a common ingredient in making hearty, yet medicinally potent soups and broths. The inulin-rich tap roots of a number of different mallow species, including common mallow, have been used. The seed pods can be substituted for most of the egg white if wanting to make mallow meringues. Simply boil up the peeled seed pods using 3 parts water 1 part seed pods, and reduce the liquid by half. For every half cup of liquid add one egg white, ¼ tsp of cream of tartar, some vanilla and castor sugar, then whip it up until foamy and stiff, just like meringues.  21st Century Foraging  The Medicinal Forest Garden  The Fast Wild Food Cookbookby Johnny Jumbalaya  Amazing Moringa: Medicinal, Edible & Easy to Grow  How to Make your own Sloe Gin Chris Hope, aka Chris Phyto, was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic plant lover, forager and teacher, who sadly died in 2021.";Permaculture Magazine UK

Salt and pepper to taste For the garlic bread
A crusty loaf of bread 
4-10 cloves garlic (I like it strong!)
0.5-1 cup olive oil (it depends how large the loaf is)
Pepper
An oven dish approximately 25 x 25cm (10 x 10in) Preheat the oven to 180oC fan (200oC/400oF/gas mark 6). Finely chop the garlic and mix into the olive oil. Add a little pepper, stir and leave to infuse. Slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways into 5mm thick slices. Pour some olive oil into the pan and soften the onions, garlic and celery on a low heat.  When cooked, add the red pepper, beans and tomatoes. Simmer for around 15 minutes until the sauce is cooked through. Meanwhile, drizzle olive oil onto a griddle and cook the aubergines and courgettes, several slices at a time, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Pour some of the tomato sauce into the oven dish, add a layer of aubergine, then more sauce, a layer of courgette, and so on until the dish is filled with layers of sauce, aubergine and courgette. Decorate with slices of tomato. Put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Slice the bread so the knife goes about 90% through the loaf, leaving the base intact and the slices attached to each other. Put in a baking dish and, using a spoon, drizzle the garlic oil over both sides of each slice.  15 minutes before the lasagne is ready, put the bread in the oven. When the lasagne is cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the crusty garlic bread and a large salad, or dish of steamed seasonal green vegetables. Tip – Frying pan will work if you don’t have a griddle. This recipe adapts well to other vegetables. In the winter, use slices of cooked potato, parsnip, sweet potato or squash.

"My name is Suzanne Pendleton and I live in Swinton, Salford (UK) and have been involved in the Greater Manchester Swift Street initiative since August 2024, which has been led by the RSPB. During lockdown I started to value my time outside as so many families did too. I enjoyed time in our little garden more and spotted some birds as they zoomed and screamed over the house. I wasn’t quite sure what they were and asked my friend Kathleen who lived on a surrounding road what they might be. She enlightened me. They were Swifts, a species recently added to the UK’s Red List of birds, meaning they are now amongst our most threatened. Then the summer was over and the swifts left Swinton heading back to Africa.  Each year since, I have eagerly anticipated the return of the Swifts. My understanding grew and I learnt of their declining numbers, now less than 60,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Along with developing a stiff neck constantly looking up to the sky, watching their incredible aerial manoeuvres.  I am privileged to live in a friendly neighbourhood on our lane. The community are always up for helping, and we pull together to help each other. We have a community messaging service which came into its own in lockdown, and continues to be a fabulous way to share information and request help and advice. During the last few years I had messaged our community group and asked if anyone knew about our Swifts and where they were nesting. Initially we were unsuccessful in understanding, but in spring 2024 we struck lucky and finally worked out the eaves where they lived. I’d also discovered Swift Mapper (an app for recording the location of Swift nesting sites) enabling us to understand we had four nest sites on the Lane and surrounding roads.  We also realised that there was another small colony locally less that 1/4 mile away. Last August, a resident of this local road got in touch to say Roshni (Parmar-Hill, Community Engagement Officer) from the RSPB had been to visit their colony. She asked if we’d be interested in getting involved with developing our Swift Street – thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery – and I eagerly accepted the offer. We used our community messaging group to share the news of the Swift Street development and I was overwhelmed by the local response. So many families were keen to help our Swift population, with more than 80 boxes requested. I think the consensus was that we are so privileged that these incredible urban birds choose our lane as their home, and as their nesting places can be threatened by redevelopment, having the opportunity to install boxes is a wonderful chance to do something proactive to help.  Roshni and I visited local homes who had expressed interest, helping families select potential sites for their boxes to be positioned. With Roshni’s guidance we talked about what Swifts need and I and residents began to understand more about how Swifts live. They are remarkably compatible with humans, don’t need a bird bath, bird table etc. as they feed on insects on the wing. I discovered along with other residents that the best way we could help our Swifts was to protect their current nesting sites, add boxes for more birds to nest in and to do all we could to support insect populations. For example, considering planting in our gardens to promote insect life, adopting No Mow May and not using insecticides. Those who weren’t able to install a box could instead help in other ways, so this made the project accessible for all – everyone could join in. Next came the production of the boxes. Roshni contacted local colleges and we were thrilled when a local skills centre suggested their joinery students could make these free of charge. Production began and numbers of those interested had grown as the message about the project spread, and so 100 boxes were produced.  Meanwhile, local guiding groups learnt of the initiative and Roshni visited the groups that I lead, as Brown Owl – 90 girls and young women were keen to learn about Swifts and how they could help. The groups were already keen to learn about environmental matters, and this project really whetted their appetite. The Brownies, Guides and Rangers designed posters, made seed bombs and grew in their understanding of our Swifts. Once the production of the boxes was finished the Brownies, Rangers and Guides got stuck into painting them with an environmentally friendly product which would protect the boxes, and a local lady Haldis (a RSPB Swift Champion, a voluntary role which supports local conservation efforts to protect the species) made the nest cups which would be inserted into each box.  We arrived at installation day on Saturday 8th March, with 25 boxes going up on that first day. By the end of March, 80 had been erected by a local roofer, Ryan. Of course, we needed to celebrate the returning of our precious Swifts and so we began planning our community event. Volunteers came forward from the surrounding roads and we met in a resident’s kitchen each Wednesday, so all could contribute ideas. Other local guiding groups wanted to contribute and so they made nature-themed bunting, and we were thrilled when the church on the lane offered their venue as a space for us to celebrate. The local dance and drama group wanted to be involved and so their leaders and young people planned songs and a drama production with poetry. And as if we weren’t already exciting enough, we then heard the news that RSPB Ambassador Megan McCubbin would love to come along to formally open our Swift Street.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on 17th May, with a fantastic community event. Sixty families made bee hotels, children had Swift-themed face paint, and a plant swap was popular. RSPB provided and led crafts, and local artists supported youngsters to make Swift puppets. More than 300 residents attended and watched the young people perform. The ribbon was cut revealing a beautiful Swift Street banner created by a local artist, alongside Swift boxes 99 and 100 positioned proudly on the front of the church. And yes, we had Swifts soaring high above us all day (perhaps watching the proceedings?) to the delight of the watching children and residents. As the street party continued into the evening we couldn’t believe our eyes when a ‘banger’ (a young Swift, which gets its name from its tendency to bang against prospective nest to check if they’re occupied or not) attempted to enter one of the newly positioned boxes. A perfect end to a fabulous day.  It’s been an absolute honour to be involved in this project and I feel so lucky that our community have been able to do something practical to support our local Swifts.

"We are delighted to announce the recipients of the 2025 Permaculture Magazine Award, in collaboration with Lush Spring Prize. Four projects have been awarded from a fund of £25,000. The Permaculture Magazine Award is a celebration of the vital work of permaculture projects from around the world. The Permaculture Magazine Award was established in 2018 to celebrate the vital work of permaculture projects around the world. To date (May 2025) it has awarded 28 projects with over £155,000. The award has received hundreds of applications, and it is a privilege to highlight this vital regenerative work that is world changing. Coordinating a network of permaculture centres, NGO Permaculture Ukraine offers training, events and educational resources across Ukraine, also ensuring accessibility for internally displaced people (IDP) and former military personnel. The organisation was founded following the first Permaculture Design Course (PDC) in Ukraine in 2011, and has held at least one PDC annually, actively seeking funding to make training accessible to vulnerable groups. Following the full-scale invasion in 2022, its focus expanded to include: The 14 permaculture centres provide training, shelter for IDPs and war-abandoned animals, and rehabilitation for children and adults. Its designers also create communal projects, including schools and homes for disabled people. Despite air raids and blackouts, NGO Permaculture Ukraine successfully hosted a two-day permaculture festival in Kyiv’s botanical garden in September 2024, drawing 100 participants eager to engage with top regenerative practitioners. NGO Permaculture Ukraine empowers Ukrainians for sustainable living and transformative change. Through active social media engagement and collaborations with ecovillages, zero-waste networks, and other ecological movements, it extends its influence and inspires a growing audience to adopt permaculture principles for Ukraine’s regeneration. https://permaculture.in.ua Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Since its founding in 2021, Battmung has: Recognising the importance of connecting people, Battmung also contributed to the founding of the Permaculture Institute of Korea (P.I.K) in 2023. Its goal is to organise its regional network and regenerate South Korea through permaculture, restoring soil, food chains, ecological awareness, and local economies. www.instagram.com/battmung.log Eco Centro Allpa Tarpuna works for the regeneration of degraded lands, food sovereignty and community autonomy, with a focus on indigenous communities in Ecuador. Founded in 2004, it was born out of the return of its founders to their community after experiencing the negative impacts of conventional agriculture and agrochemicals. This return marked the beginning of a path towards reconnecting with indigenous ancestral knowledge and adopting permaculture and organic production. One of the key achievements has been the recovery of soils degraded by monocultures and eucalyptus. Although slow, this process has demonstrated the benefits of a regenerative approach and strengthened the resilience of the community. Allpa Tarpuna is currently focusing on: Allpa Tarpuna integrates bio-construction, renewable energy and sustainable water management into its practices. It also encourages the preservation of ancestral seeds and agro-ecological techniques such as crop rotation, reducing dependence on chemicals. In the future, it wants to expand its training in permaculture design, combining indigenous knowledge with modern regenerative solutions. It seeks to empower more local farmers, promoting designs that restore the connection between people and nature. Allpa Tarpuna is a living indigenous family that sows regeneration, inspiring a sustainable and resilient balance. https://allpatarpuna.org HortaFCUL is a community-based permaculture project based in Lisbon University’s Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). The initiative was launched by a group of biology students concerned about the gap between sustainability ideals and the university’s environmental impact. This bottom-up project has developed an important role as a catalyst of practical scientific-based knowledge. Nowadays, HortaFCUL is a resilient, sustainable and inclusive community, allowing the general public to learn more about nature-based solutions. It has five subprojects at campus level and relies on a volunteer-based horizontally-organised guardians collective to maintain the project’s green areas. HortaFCUL, as a permaculture project, achieves its central goals by closing functional loops related to human activities.

"As politicians wait, grassroots changemakers are restoring ecosystems and rebuilding resilience. They are living examples that regeneration is not just possible, it’s already happening all over the world.  The Lush Spring Prize 2025 is showcasing this work and has awarded around £250,000 to 19 groups, celebrating regenerative organisations and practitioners from around the world. Lead image: Clockwise from top left: Agro-Pueblos (Colombia), Ñu’u Ndito (Mexico), Global Ecovillage Network (Global), Land in Our Names (UK) In a joyous, collaborative and inspiring week of celebrations, the 2025 recipients were honoured as part of a celebratory event held in Dorset (UK), where the Lush Cosmetics company is headquartered. The event was attended by prize recipients, Spring Prize judges, Lush staff, press, funders and other regenerative practitioners. Co-designed with the prize recipients themselves, the event provides a space to connect, co-learn and share stories of regeneration. It offered an opportunity to explore both the diversity of people and organisations that make up the regenerative movement and the common challenges, learnings and successes that unites it. Each Spring Prize year sees different themes emerge that are shaped by the organisations that receive a prize. In 2025, these include the importance of weaving ancestral wisdom with scientific approaches; working at multiple scales and legally recognising the rights of nature, and learning from those on the frontlines that are facilitating regenerative work in conflict zones or regions experiencing natural disasters. In 2025, the backdrop of violence and conflict looms large. Prize recipients from Lebanon and Ukraine are responding to invasions by powerful aggressors, in Myanmar they are working in a context of ongoing internal conflict and many of the Indigenous groups are frequently facing the threat of violence.  The Spring Prize 2025 event allows these groups to come together and share what regenerative work in these situations looks like in a way that may challenge the existing narrative: “In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the biggest achievement for our organisation is to continue our activities and find ways to be useful for Ukrainian society like creating permaculture public spaces and rehabilitating people in our demonstration centers. The war has taught us that strength is in unity and networks, that autonomous homesteads and farms that grow their own food and preserve their seeds can not only survive but also help other people, and that international support and networks matter.” NGO Permaculture in Ukraine While humanity witnesses declining biodiversity, climate catastrophes and widespread conflict, these organisations highlight how regenerative practices are not just a source of hope but a necessary and much needed response.

Examples of this year’s awarded projects include: Aguaje palm tree seedlings were distributed among Kukama families in Parinari, Loreto, Peru, as part of the reforestation and conservation initiative led by Huaynakana. Extractivism represents a constant threat to the Kukama territory in Peru and the loss of the Kukama peoples’ cultural identity. Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana exists to protect this. The Kukama people conceive of the territory as a whole and women having an intrinsic connection to it. The term ‘kukama’ for example is composed of two words: ‘ku’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘kama’ meaning ‘bosom,’ and it signifies ‘field-bosom’ or ‘nourished by the field.’ Given the Kukama peoples’ lives are reliant on the forest ecosystems of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and considering how they have adapted and coexisted with them for decades, the territory and the rivers are inseparable from their culture and way of life. They consider the rivers to be living beings with spirits, and therefore sacred. Founded in 2001, Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana embarked on a long journey of collective actions, protests, and mobilisations in pursuit of environmental justice as the river’s health declined as a result of extractive industries. In September 2021 Huaynakana filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognise the Marañón River as a living being and subject of rights. In March 2024, the provincial court of Nauta ruled that the Marañón River has intrinsic rights, including the right to flow, to be free from pollution, and to be restored to environmental health. This decision also recognised Indigenous communities as the river’s legal representatives, defenders, and guardians. This landmark ruling was ratified by the higher court last November. Huaynakana plays a key role in defending the Marañón’s rights and supporting the regeneration and conservation of the waterways through reforestation efforts because without the river, these unique forests cannot exist. Mushrooms harvested from the Ubuntu food forest Ubuntu Learning Hub Trust was set up in 2022 with a mission to support people who are in transition towards more resilient futures and a healthier planet. The Trust immediately began to set up the Ubuntu Learning Centre as an open learning space for all ages as well as a demonstration centre for integrating technologies that are in tune with a healthy Mother Earth. The learning centre sits on a two-hectare site in Chikancila village in Chongwe district of Lusaka Province of Zambia. It is founded on the African philosophy of Ubuntu which helps people to learn what it means to be truly human. It hosts people from all walks of life who are looking for pathways to escape the rat race and curve more sustainable futures for themselves, their families and the communities where they come from. The Trust uses agro-ecological practices to regenerate the degraded farmland that was damaged over decades of poor land husbandry. For example, the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) technique has helped to restore much of the indigenous vegetation on the land. People come to Ubuntu to explore the meaning of life and to find their life purpose. They stay at Ubuntu for varying lengths of time and in the process they are engaged in intercultural exchanges as well as learning how to take care of themselves and of Mother Earth. The Trust offers life changing experiences rather than certificates and the opportunity to carve out an earth-centred worldview for themselves.

The Cultural Conservancy (TCC) is a Native-led non-profit organisation based in San Francisco, California. Founded in 1985, its mission is to protect and revitalise Indigenous cultures through the direct application of traditional knowledge and practices on ancestral lands. It works with Native/Indigenous peoples locally and globally on community-based projects that are shaped by community requests and guided by the Native Advisory Council of Traditional Knowledge Holders, land-care practitioners, and community leaders. From language revitalisation and traditional carving projects to Indigenous agricultural sciences and traditional land tending, critical to its work is the acknowledgement of the sacred relationship Native peoples have to their lands and waters and the importance of this relationship to their physical, mental, and community health. Through its flagship Native Foodways Programme and its land project Heron Shadow, it: Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design.

Harvesting with Battmung friends The LUSH Spring Prize is a joint venture between LUSH Cosmetics and Ethical Consumer and is now in its sixth prize cycle, having started in 2017. The Spring Prize has distributed more than £1.3 million to regenerative projects worldwide. The LUSH Spring Prize was set up to support ‘regenerative’ projects – those that go beyond sustainability by taking holistic approaches to building the health of ecology, economy and social systems. It seeks to support those who are leaving the world lusher than they found it, and are actively restoring all the systems they are part of. By supporting regenerative projects the Spring Prize hopes to raise the profile of the movement as a whole to inspire more individuals, groups, communities, funders, media platforms and businesses to start engaging with regenerative processes.  The Spring Prize judging panels are made up of people drawn from a diverse range of movements that represent regenerative design, permaculture, food sovereignty, transition towns, biomimicry, eco-village networks and various social justice movements. Each prize cycle a ‘Lush Customer Judge’ and ‘Lush Staff Judge’ are also selected to act as additional independent members of the judging panel.  The collaborative prizes have separate panels, which also include judges from the main Spring Prize panel. The majority of the judging panel for the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Award self identify as Indigenous themselves, some being previous recipients of the award. The judges are not just involved in choosing the recipients but are involved in shaping the prize as a whole, attending the event and connecting with prize recipients.

"Around 40 years ago, the Sahel, an extremely arid region located in central Africa, was an area of agricultural desolation. Due to natural factors such as heavy drought and interannual variability, combined with anthropocentric influences like climate change, overgrazing and deforestation, the environment has become particularly unstable with little possibility for productivity.  Furthermore, when rain does fall in the arid region, the soil is so dry due to a lack of precipitation, that water immediately ‘runs off’ or evaporates, failing to soak into the depleted earth. Some countries within the region, such as Burkina Faso, faced up to 24% of their arable lands classed as highly degraded in 1998 (Maatman et al., 1998).  In the early 2000s, NGOs and organisations such as the United Nations, the World Food Programme and WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), amongst others, sought to reverse the desertification of many parts of Africa, including the Sahel, in cooperation with farmers and communities from the affected regions. Using the ancient ‘half moon’ water harvesting technique – used for centuries in Africa and the Middle East, the revitalised technique aims to facilitate water retention and re-green the ecosystem. Heavy machinery or hand tools can be used to plough the soil roughly 30cm down in a semi-circle or ‘half moon’ shape. The diameter of these half moons are typically about 4 metres. When it rains, the contours catch the rainwater, preventing runoff and allowing it to infiltrate the soil. This creates ‘favourable micro-climate conditions’ allowing drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet to be planted.  If planted on steep slopes, half-moon ‘bunds’ can assist the growth of tree species. They can also be used in combination with controlled grazing to boost re-vegetation. In Niger, The World Food Programme (WFP) has been implementing half-moon planting projects since 2014. Just 5 years into the scheme, the benefits of its implementation were examined by a progress-review. In 2019, over 400 households had restored approximately 3,000 acres of land, largely for use in producing food for livestock. This has promoted social cohesion and economic growth by providing more jobs and stabilising agricultural output in a formerly capricious climate. This scenario exhibits the benefits of a localised, small-scale regenerative farming technique such as half-moon planting through its trickle-down effects, stipulating broader socio-economic growth. A study on the impact of reformed agroecological techniques was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Burkina Faso. Figures revealed that fields ploughed using the half-moon method saw the rates of increase for grain yield at 8% (The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 2017). As farmers sought new ways to boost crop yields, regenerative farming techniques such as the half-moon method were found to be successful when used in conjunction with others. In Burkina Faso, half-moon planting is exercised alongside the Zaï technique, which is useful when adapting to various soil types and structures. The Zaï method, suitable to the arid Sahel region, uses similar methods seen in the half-moons, but alternatively involves digging smaller pits in non-permeable soil to intercept water and gather compost material. These pits are slightly smaller than the half-moons and so are less labour intensive and can be utilised in smaller growing plots. They are roughly between 15-50cm across; 5-15cm deep; and positioned 80cm apart. This technique was reintroduced to the area in the 1980s by farmer and agronomist Yacouba Sawadogo, who pioneered the method of filling the holes with manure to further break up the earth and bolster soil productivity.

"Traditional Māori time systems were measured in accordance to the night as opposed to the Western proxy of daylight. Each night of the lunar month had a particular name and this cumulatively formed a lunar calendar known as ‘Maramataka‘. Farming according to the Maramataka lunar calendar is used in conjunction with Māori regenerative farming techniques to adapt to nature’s schedule as opposed to imposing controls on the earth’s processes. Many farmers are now seeking to turn back to these ancient methods in line with broader sustainability imperatives. Under the Maramataka calendar, individual lunar nights were marked according to how optimal they were for catching fish, eels or planting crops, with each night having its own name. A good example is eel fishing. It is not productive on a full moon – Rākaunui – because the moon’s light would not allow eel to hunt their prey, as the prey could see them. As with biodynamics (the Rudolf Steiner lunar approach for farming), planting crops is nest at a full moon, when the gravitational pull is at its highest, because it has maximum influence on water in the soil. “Despite the use of Maramataka being limited to a relative few today, largely because of colonisation, interest in and revival of this knowledge and practice is growing.”1 Many farmers are returning to the use of farming tactics such as Maramataka planting in line with broader regenerative goals. The Revitalise Te Taiao programme aims to fund sustainable and lucrative agribusiness solutions to cultivate Te Taiao (the natural world). This project provided $2.7 million in funding to Miru Young and Mohi Beckham, farmers based in the North Island’s Bay of Plenty, to trial agriculture techniques which aim to “enhance the mana and mauri of the soil” across 10 farm sites. As part of the scheme, both farmers undertook rigorous research, sowing pasture throughout different moon phases from resting and dormant phases to high-energy phases for plant growth. Soon, grass seeds sown during the high energy periods of the Maramataka calendar outgrew neighbouring crops planted in other phases, even if the latter had been sown 10 days before. Despite still being in the trial stages of Maramataka planting, Miru and Mohi observed various positive impacts of the scheme within the first few months. Their land has seen higher productivity and crop yields, with a 93% crop survival rate under Maramataka planting, that is an increase of 13% from the usual 80% under previous methods. One of the main issues associated with returning to traditional farming methods on a broader scale is competing with intensive methods in New Zealand’s modern agricultural industry. After settlers from the West arrived in New Zealand during the 18th and 19th centuries, intensive farming practices quickly became widespread.  As farming in the country has continuously expanded into the modern day, with agricultural exports making up a large proportion of the country’s GDP, traditional farming methods have become far less lucrative in the broader market. This meant that Māori farmers had to adopt newer techniques, as those trying to maintain the traditional methods were faced with far lower crop yields and income. Rural management programmes and sustainability objectives are constantly investigating new and feasible ways to rejuvenate te ao Māori farming techniques, with the Revitalise Te Taiao programme representing just one of many schemes. The Maramataka lunar calendar is part of a broader Maori worldview known as Mātauranga Māori – a term used to describe the collective knowledge of Māori living in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the knowledge passed down from their ancestors. Kaitiakitanga (stewardship/management) and the link between Whakapapa (Māori genealogy/ancestral descent) and Whenua (land) are key areas of te ao Māori and Mātauranga values.  By embracing schools of thought that are native to Aotearoa, alongside promoting equitable stewardship across modern farming methodologies, high agricultural output can be attained. Reforming the agribusiness in New Zealand will involve reintegrating Māori into decision making processes, embracing cross-cultural thought processes and utilising western technological advancements for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.

"Lammas is a celebration of the summer and the gathering in of the grain harvest. This was especially significant in the past. After all the hard work of getting the grain crop cut, threshed, stored and stacked, there came a time for feasting, celebration and assessment. Lammas is a Saxon name meaning ‘Loaf-mass’. Lughnasadh (pronounced Loo-nas-ah) is Irish Gaelic. On Lammas Eve fires were lit on Lammas mounds such as Silbury Hill at Avebury, to honour the Corn Mother as she gives birth to her harvest child, the Grain. This is the seed that will bring next year’s harvest as well as the grain that will sustain life throughout the winter. The month of August was the month of the Grain Mother. An ‘augur’ is an old word for seer and meant ‘increaser’. The great abundance of the Earth Mother is reflected in the titles she was given at this time: The Grain Mother, Barley Mother, Corn Mother, Demeter, Ceres, Cerealia, Grain, the Wise One of the Earth, the Increaser, She who is the seed, who is the womb, who is the soil, the Great Provider, the Preserver of Life. Cutting the ‘corn’ seems to be a general term for all cereal crops, whether they are wheat, barley, rye or oats. There were many customs and rituals throughout Europe to honour the first and the last sheaf of corn to be cut. The last sheaf was often cut by the youngest girl present and fashioned into a Corn Maiden. It was carried joyfully back to the village, sometimes plaited and decked with ribbons, and usually hung over the fireplace. Sometimes it was dressed in women’s clothes, and ritually burnt on the Lammas Fire. Sometimes these Corn Maidens were kept until Yule when they were divided up amongst the cattle or kept until the spring. Sometimes they were kept with the date tied to them. Many Corn Maidens would be seen hanging above the fireplace. In Scotland the ‘young maid’ was made out of the last stalks cut, and kept. The ‘old wife’ was made out of the first stalks cut and was passed on to the nearest farm that had not finished bringing in the corn. This was then passed round until it ended up at the last farm to be cut. Another old European custom was to weave the last sheaf into a large Corn Mother with a smaller corn doll inside it, representing next year’s unborn harvest. The regenerative power of the Earth is never more manifest than now as the grain harvest is gathered in and the Sun’s cycle begins to wane. The Cauldron of Regeneration was central to Celtic spiritual understanding. We are renewed by sleep and darkness, through many deaths and rebirths, and by the sacrifice of our outer lives for the inner journey. Here at Lammas, the doorway to the inner realms is opening. This is the symbolism behind the Demeter/Kore/Persephone story. Demeter, the Corn Mother, represents the ripe corn of this year’s harvest, and Kore or Persephone represents the grain-seed who lives in the dark throughout the winter and reappears in the Spring. Persephone’s descent into the Underworld is a mythical interpretation of the seed lying in the ground during the dark winter months, and her reappearance as the young maid, or the new sprouting seed, in the spring. This story shows us the Triple Goddess in all her aspects: as Earth Mother, the abundant provider; as the Crone, the wisdom found within; and as the Maiden who returns renewed in the spring. Pluto/Hades’ abduction of Persephone is a later reworking of this older myth. After all the manifest energy and activity of the early summer, it is good to make time now to rest and to assimilate all that has happened during the Sun’s active phase. Lammas celebrations would probably have begun with the cutting of the last sheaf of corn. Although the 2nd of August is the calendar date for Lammas, the great Lammas fairs and feasts would probably have lasted from mid July to mid August and would have peaked around the time of the harvest Full Moon. Once the grain had been safely gathered in and the men returned from their hunting trips, it was a time for feasting, dancing and merry-making, a great celebration of the first of the harvest and assessment of the year’s achievements. Beer, wine, cider and whisky made from the previous year’s harvest, were ritually drunk, celebrating the transformative power of Fire and Water. Cooking fires were honoured as they too embodied the power of Fire and Water. Bread was made from the new grain and thanks were given to the Sun’s life energy reborn as the bread of life. This is a busy time for harvesting herbs and collecting herb seeds to sow in the spring. Give thanks and blessings as you pick them, dry them and store them. Review what you know about them and ways you can use them both physically and metaphysically. Harvest sage at the end of July, before the flowers have come out. Sage is a herb associated with wisdom and releasing blocks in expression. It is connected to the throat chakra and is for those who have something to say but cannot let it out. It will help you express your emotions. Make the herb tea in the usual way. The infusion is a useful antiseptic herb for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers and mouth infections. It can be used as a gargle, for bathing wounds, sores, and to stop bleeding. Use the tea infusion externally and then drink afterwards as well. It will dry up excess secretions such as catarrh or sinusitis. It contains oestrogen and is useful in the menopause and for delayed menstruation. Burn dried sage to cleanse and purify. Waft the smoke around a person to cleanse their aura (called smudging). This is a good way to begin any ritual or ceremony. N.B. It must not be taken if pregnant, and because of its drying action, it must not be taken for long periods of time. It will dry up mother’s milk. Care must be taken by those who are insulin-dependent, and to be avoided by epileptics. Garlands of meadowsweet were traditionally worn for the Lammas celebrations. Its heady perfume expands the psyche, and builds inner strength. It enhances flexibility and connection to the inner levels. It is a mild sedative and painkiller containing salicylic acid (aspirin) that affects the rate at which blood clots. It is a good digestive tonic that reduces excess acidity and is useful for heartburn, hyperacidity, gastritis and peptic ulcers. As it cleanses the body of harmful acids, it is useful for any inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is a strong diuretic (increases urine) and can be used for any bladder or kidney complaint including cystitis. It reduces stagnation in the liver and therefore will help the immune system function more effectively. Its harvest time is July and August when the flowers are just beginning to open. Collect them in brown paper bags to dry for later use. N.B.

"There are various methods for drying herbs for herbal recipes but they all require that the herb is dried and stored out of the light. I prefer to use brown paper bags, other people hang them up in bunches or lay them between sheets of newspaper or brown paper. • If using brown paper bags always label the bags with the name of the herb, the date and where you picked it. This is good practice and a good habit to get into as plants can change a lot in the drying process. Even if you think you will know what it is, it is surprising how you can forget, especially if you bag up several herbs over a period of a few weeks. • Leave the bags in a dry warm environment for several weeks. Put them in the airing cupboard if you have one, hang over the wood-burner or leave them on top of radiators. Shake the bags and turn the leaves over with your hands every day or two. It is essential to do this to stop any mould getting in to the herbs while they are still drying. • The herbal properties of leaves and flowers will deteriorate after 1 year so they need to be re-collected every year. Fruit, seeds, berries, roots and bark will last for 2 years. It is light that destroys the herbal properties of herbs, so at its simplest herbs can be stored all year in brown paper bags, although if they are kept in the kitchen they will need to be kept in a plastic container or airtight tin to keep them dry. Keeping the herbs in a dedicated leather or cotton bag is the traditional medicine way and these are hung somewhere warm and dry, near a radiator or fire. Putting them into dark glass jars is good in a kitchen because of the condensation. Clear jam jars are fine if they are kept in a dark cupboard. At its simplest the jar can be kept in a brown paper bag or more creative ways can be found. Herb teas vary in taste and quality. Buying popular blends as tea bags is convenient, but be aware that the herbs may be old by the time you drink them, and the herbs may have been grown in monocultures and sprayed with petrochemicals. It is infinitely better to make your own. • Making herb teas is not an exact science, especially when using the common safe plants. Interestingly, different herbalists use different amounts. I use about a teaspoonful of dried herbs or a small pile that fits into the hollow of my palm, and between a half to a pint of water, depending on the need. Use less for young children and anyone who is weak and frail. Dried herbs have twice the strength of fresh herbs, so twice the amount of fresh herb is used. • As you make the tea, say thank you to the plant. This open-hearted attitude adds to the healing process. I like to picture the plant and affirm its healing qualities as I wait for the tea to brew, partly to affirm the healing I am engaged in and also as a memory aid. This way I keep learning and understanding more about the plants all the time and keep my knowledge strong. Many of the herbs are an acquired taste. Nurture an openness to these wild flavours and earthy tastes and give them a chance. More often than not, a taste you didn’t like at first becomes a taste that you find you love. These are also for adults only as they are a mixture of brandy and honey. This makes them a most delicious way to take your medicine! They are especially good to use when travelling as they are kept in small dropper bottles and taken neat. Elixirs are combination remedies, created for specific uses and personal needs. Elixirs need to taste good so the addition of any aromatic herbs improves the flavour, but must also support the over-all herbal action. They are experimental and fun, as well as being extremely effective and I like to give them creative names. Write up everything in your Herb Journal. This is especially important when you make combination elixirs. Recording the plants and proportions used is invaluable when you create something you want to repeat. Method one 1. Half fill a dark jar with a herb or combinations of herbs: tear the leaves, crush the seeds or fruit, and chop the roots. Send your thanks to the plants. Add a little of something that will give it a nice flavour such as rose petals, sweet violet, lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena etc, making sure that their actions support the overall use of the remedy. 2. Cover the plant matter with clear runny honey and send your silent thanks to the bees. Poke well with a chopstick to get out any trapped air bubbles and break the plant matter up further. 3. Then top the jar up with brandy and 4. Put on the lid and label, date and shake well. Give it a poke and a shake frequently and keep out of bright light. They are ready in about a month, although they come to no harm if they are left longer. 5. Strain off the plant matter and rebottle in clean dark dropper bottles. Pour a little boiling water over the mash of herbs that are left over, getting every last bit of goodness out of them. Toast the plant and its medicine and have your first taste before returning the spent mash to the earth with thanks. Method two Create an instant elixir using the tinctures you have made. 1. Using a jug combine several tinctures that support the remedy you are making. 2. Mix in a similar amount of honey to tincture and mix the two together. 3. Pour into dark dropper bottles. Name and date and write up in your herb journal. Their dosage is similar to tinctures, although I tend to use them little and often. Here are some suggestions of plants to choose from, depending on what you have available. I have listed the native plants first and the aromatics at the end. Anti-stress elixir Hawthorn, cowslip, vervain, rose petals, lavender, borage. Drops of calm Hawthorn, elderflowers, cowslip, hops, valerian, vervain, rose petals, borage, lavender, chamomile. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Letting in the Wild Edges, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"Growing my own mulch has long been a goal of mine. We use a lot of mulch in the nursery and garden and at the moment I have no problem sourcing straw but if/when the day comes that the farmers start using their own straw to improve their soil (which is becoming a more common practice), I’ll be needing to step up my mulch growing efforts. Currently, I grow enough mulch to sustain my perennial beds and around 10% of my annual beds but rely on imported straw for mulching the other 90% of annual vegetable and nursery beds. My ideal mulch plant grows fast, is drought tolerant, competes minimally with crop plants, does not contain seed that easily spreads, is easy to handle and cut, i.e. not thorny/prickly or tough and fibrous, and can biodegrade relatively quickly (thereby returning the nutrients back to soil). I’ve broadly categorized the main sources of mulch we produce in our 1500m2 garden. Aquatic plants
I grow emergent wetland species such us cattails (Typha spp), sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) on the banks of a small pond (6m x 3m), and within a grey water reed bed (1m x 6m). The pond also provides suitable habitat for hornworts (Ceratophyllum spp). a submerged rootless perennial that gathers on the surface en masse. This plant makes an excellent mulch being rich in nitrogen, growing very fast and is easy to position around the base of plants. The emergent species provide a good thick carbon rich mulch that helps to reduce evaporation on the terrestrial beds and I cut these back in the spring in case they are used for overwintering invertebrates. Aquatic plants are an excellent source of mulch as there are no issues with seed germinating amongst your land based crops. Tap rooted perennial / biennials
Deep rooted perennial plants tend to produce a good amount of biomass, are generally drought tolerant and do not compete strongly with our crop plants. I have found native biennial weeds such as greater burdock (Arctium lappa), a very useful mulch plant with the gigantic leaves growing back very fast after a cut. Lesser burdock (Arctium minus), is also useful albeit to lesser extent. Although biennial, if you cut back these plants before flowering you can prolong their life, harvesting good quantities of seed free biomass. I do eventually allow some of the plants to flower and they are much loved by bees among other insects. Comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum), ‘bocking 14’, is a classic example of a deep rooted mulch plant. We have the plant scattered throughout the garden and planted in dedicated patches. The plants do require irrigation however and will only provide good leaf yields if grown on fertile soil. Peeing on the plants is recommended. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), provide a great source of biomass. For a good tuber harvest it’s best to wait until the end of the season before harvesting the mulch. We can never consume as much as we produce of these tubers in the kitchen. I have found them to be much appreciated by our pigs and an excellent source of fresh winter food for our rabbits. Leaves of greater burdock (Arctium lappa) Nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs 
These plants take a while to establish but make an excellent contribution. I’ve had good results from coppicing empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), when they are 3-years-old and chop and dropping the soft new growth three or four times a year. I am expecting to also see good results from grey alder (Alnus incana) and Italian alder (Alnus cordata). I avoid using thorny nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs for this purpose. Annual trimming of shrubs such as autumn olive – Elaeagnus umbellata and broom – Cytisus scoparius also provides good quantities of mulch. Click here for more info on nitrogen fixing plants. Lawn and ground cover
One of my favourite sources of mulch is lawn trimmings. They are great for mulching potted plants or applying a mulch into tight spots. Mixed species lawns will contain a more diverse mix of mineral nutrients. Lawns including a legume such as white clover (Trifolim repens), can provide a nitrogen rich mulch. It’s a good idea to leave some of the trimmings behind to keep the lawn healthy. Autumn leaf fall and herbaceous stem residue
The annual shedding of leaves from trees and shrubs in our garden make a great contribution to our mulch capital. Leaves can be cleared from paths, lawns and wildflower beds (as they will disrupt the growth in these areas) and concentrated where they are of benefit such as the base of high demanding fruiting shrubs such as blackcurrants or blackberries. Herbaceous perennials such as lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis) and mints (Mentha spp). will provide dead stems annually. It’s always a good idea to leave hollow stems of some herbaceous perennials to remain for the winter as they are utilized by invertebrates for egg laying and hibernating. If the plant does not have a hollow stem it can be cut back and used for mulch. Fennel (Foeniculm vulgare), provides large quantities of biomass and as far as I can tell the stems are not utilised by any organism over the winter. In the vegetable garden all the remnants of my crops after harvesting go straight back to the surface for recycling. Foeniculum vulgare and other herbaceous perennials Tree prunings
Woody prunings from shrubs, trees and vines cut into small pieces (5-10cm) make good mulch in the mature areas of the forest garden with well established fungal soils specializing in breaking down the lignified woody material. Living mulches 
In the more mature areas of the garden where the trees have established (5yrs and older) I have dispensed with mulch all together in favour of ground cover plants that can be considered living mulches. Some the most successful perennial living mulches I have found that form good dense cover in the shade include bugle (Ajuga reptans), spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), Caucasian stonecrop (Sedem spurium), perwinkle (Vinca major) and betony (Stachys officinalis). Lamium maculatum spreading well under a mullbery (Morus alba) Scaling up mulch production
In order to grow enough mulch to provide a water retaining, weed excluding barrier for my annual and nursery beds I would certainly need more space. A larger wetland area would be ideal, with aquatic species growing very fast and the seed bearing parts of the plants being non problematic to use on terrestrial beds. If you don’t have a reliable aquatic habitat, the next best option for growing quantities of mulch without irrigation and fertilization is probably grass. During my next post I’ll be sharing a plan where using the lessons garnered from small scale systems, we’ll be growing mulch to support approx 670 fruit trees and 1360 soft fruit shrubs on a 5ha Agroforestry Project (design layout below).

"There are many medicinal uses for elder – Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae family). It is an evocative tree, steeped in history, tradition, and folklore. This is one of our great food and medicinal plants, easily found in most areas of the British Isles where people have settled. It’s botanical name, Sambucus nigra, stems from the Greek word sambuke; a ‘musical pipe’, due to its hollow form supplying our ancestors a perfect wood for making pipes. The Latin ‘nigra’, means black, in allusion to the dark colour of ripe elder berry fruit. Elder is a deciduous woodland and hedgerow plant, native to Northern Europe and North America, and can be seen happily growing on most types of soil up to altitudes of approximately 470m. Superstition says to not cut elder down or burn them. This may be purely because of the toxic fumes which rise from burning elder wood, or it may be that the faeries will be really upset because you are destroying such a useful plant! Other legends have grown around this plant, such as that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who allegedly betrayed Jesus to the Romans, then said to have hanged himself from its branches. This story gave rise to the name of the edible fungus found all year round on the elder – the Jelly Ear. Elder can sometimes be found growing as a shrubby form, and sometimes like a tree on a single trunk, similar to other woodland-edge plants like hazel, hawthorn and blackthorn. A mature elder typically displays a domed crown, and will be spotted from a distance once you know it. Elders can reach 8m or more, although more commonly 5-6m or so, because of other limiting environmental factors. Ideally the plant likes a rich and damp soil in a sunny position. Elder does not like exposed sites or windy hillsides. The branches display numerous lenticels (air holes) and produce their stems with opposite pairs of buds. The buds are naked, without bud scales. The light brown, corky bark pattern on elder can appear quite similar to the invasive exotic, the ‘butterfly bush’ – Buddleja davidii. The similarity between Sambucus and Buddleja ends there. Elder’s leaves are completely different in form. They are compound, comprising of seven oval, serrated leaflets, each being about 7-10cm long. The leaflets typically come in two or three opposite pairs with one terminal leaflet. They are a much lighter green colour than the Himalayan native ‘butterfly bush’ which has a simple, lanceolate / elliptical leaf. You will find this year’s flowers and fruits on last year’s growth. The umbel-like elderflowers, (technically corymbs), are borne on terminal stems. Five creamy-white petals surround the yellow anthers. When ripe, and picked on a sunny day, are bursting with pollen and scent, and should be a bright lemon-yellow. They turn brown when past their best. Only pick ripe flowers! The flowers have a small amount of natural yeast on them which assists fermentation when making drinks. This will be testified by anyone who makes the superb thirst quenching elderflower champagne! The rank smell of elder leaves or the gone-over flowers is known to repel many who come across it, often being described as a cat urine smell!  After a short but sweet period in full bloom, the flowers give rise to upstanding clusters of small berries, which are typically no bigger than 10mm in diameter. Initially green, the berries gradually begin to nod earthwards as they ripen. At the end of the summer they are dark purple – with many medicinal uses. Parts used Flowers, berries, leaves, bark, fungi. Harvest time The flowers are picked when in full bloom. The berries are picked when ripe in the autumn. Key active medicinal constituents Tannins, potassium, mucilage, phenols, triterpenes, sterols, lectins, flavonoids (including rutin). The dark coloured berries are rich in anthocyanins, folic acid and vitamins A and C. They also contain flavonoids, and cyanidin glucosides, which are poisonous in large doses.  Medicinal actions Diaphoretic, febrifuge, anti-catarrhal, anti viral, immuno-supportive. Uses – Elderflowers and berries are expectorant and diaphoretic, thus they help to manage and reduce fevers and to rid the body of toxins. – Elderflowers are also anti-viral and are useful in combating herpes simplex type 1 virus (responsible for cold sores). – The flowers can be made into champagne, cordials, wine, sorbet, jam and fritters. – Elderberry extract has been proven to inhibit various strains of flu, especially if taken early enough. Many people can testify that elder can significantly reduce recovery times from influenza. – Some books have stated the ripe berries are poisonous, but this is slightly misleading. They will cause gastric upset if you eat a large quantity raw, (as will too many apples while scrumping) but in small amounts they should present no problem. Cooked into jams, syrups etc., larger quantities of elderberries are absolutely fine. – Pioneering contemporary forager-chefs have rediscovered that even the green berries can be used, as ‘capers’, if prepared correctly. This involves fermenting the berries in a salt brine solution for a few days, similar to preparing green walnuts for pickling, and then covering in a flavoured vinegar. – Even when the tree is dormant in the winter, it is still possible to harvest food! The ‘Jelly ear’ fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is often found on elder, dead or alive. Known as a delicacy in China, it is best cooked sliced into thin strips, in a spicy, oriental-style soup.

"There’s a plethora of info out there about comfrey but not much detail regarding establishing and managing a comfrey patch so I thought I would write an article to share my experience on this and how we grow comfrey as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden. A member of the borage family, comfrey – Symphytum spp. is native to Europe and Asia and there are 40 recorded species throughout that region. The plant most commonly referred to and used in gardens is Russian comfrey – Symphytum x uplandicum, a naturally occurring hybrid of two wild species: common comfrey – Symphytum officinale and prickly comfrey – Symphytum asperum. A few centuries back, the hybrid Symphytum x uplandicum came to the attention of Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) and he widely promoted the plant as a food and forage crop. Years later, and after two world wars, Lawrence D Hills (1911-1991) would continue Henry Doubleday’s Comfrey crusade. In the 1950s, Hills developed a comfrey research program in the village of Bocking, near Braintree in the UK. The original trial site is on the plot of land now occupied by the Doubleday Gardens housing development. Lawrence Hills lived at 20 Convent Lane just around the corner of the trial site. At this site, Hills trialed at least 21 comfrey ‘strains’, each one named after the village Bocking. Strain 14 was identified as being the most nutrient rich, non-seeding strain and ‘Bocking 14’ began its journey into gardens far and wide across the world. (Learn more its history on the Balkan Ecology Project blog.) Medicinal – Comfrey has been cultivated as a healing herb since at least 400BC. The Greeks and Romans commonly used comfrey to stop heavy bleeding, treat bronchial problems and heal wounds and broken bones. Poultices were made for external wounds and tea was consumed for internal ailments. Comfrey has been reported to promote healthy skin with its mucilage content that moisturizes and soothes and promotes cell proliferation. This plant is my first port of call if ever I need to dress a wound. Simply take a few leaves brush them together to remove the hairs and wrap them around the wound and apply light pressure. It’s incredibly effective at stopping the bleeding, reducing the pain and healing the wound. Biomas – Comfrey produces large amounts of foliage from late May (late spring) until hard frosts in October or November (late autumn). The plant is excellent for producing mulch and can be cut from 2-5 times per year depending on how well the plants are watered and fed. The plant grows rapidly after each harvest. In our gardens we have Comfrey ‘Bocking 14’ located next to each fruit tree in order to have a renewable source of mulch just where we need it. We also grow in patches as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden and have patches in the wildflower meadows (details below). We’ve supplied 1,000 ‘Bocking 14’ cuttings to Oxygenisis, a business in Germany who are experimenting with using this plant for carbon capture. Mineral dam – Comfrey has deep roots of up to 2m that utilize nutrients deep in the subsoil that would otherwise wash away with the underground soil water or remain inaccessible to other plants. The nutrients, once taken up from the roots, are relocated throughout the plant as and where needed with some of them ending up in the comfrey leaf mass. When cutting the leaf mass and applying to the soil surface, the mined nutrients are returned and again made accessible to shallower rooted crop plants.  Biodiversity – The bell shaped flowers provide nectar and pollen to many species of bees and other insects from late May until the first frosts in late autumn. Lacewings are said to lay eggs on comfrey and spiders overwinter on the plant. Parasitoid wasps and spiders will hunt on and around comfrey. Pest and disease prevention and control – Research indicates that a comfrey solution can be used to prevent powdery mildew. Pest predators such as spiders, lacewings and parasatoid wasps associate with this plant. It’s best to leave some plants alone in order to sustain pest predator relationships. Ground cover – Some species can quickly spread to form a thick ground cover and work particularly well for ground cover on the sunny side under shrubs and trees. Symphytum tuberosum – Tuberous Comfrey seems to be the best species for this.  Fertilizer – Comfrey leaves contain a great balance of major plant nutrients (N,P,K) and can be fed to plants as powder, direct mulch or by steeping chopped comfrey leaves in water for several weeks to produce a thick, dark liquid that can be diluted with water and applied to plant roots. More on this below. Nutritional value of comfrey – You can see from the below table that wilted comfrey contains significantly higher quantities of potash compared to other organic fertilizers. It’s well recorded that comfrey is an excellent source of potassium (K) a major plant nutrient that is required by plants in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction. Animal fodder – Comfrey has a long history for use as an animal feed. Lawrence D Hills dedicated books to this topic.* The leaves are best received by animals wilted. Fresh leaves can be eaten by pigs, sheep, and poultry but cattle, rabbits and horses will only consume wilted leaves. Human consumption – Symphytum officianale and Symphytum x uplandicum are both reported to be used for salad and potherb and are best when cooked. Personally I’m not keen on the texture but will have the occasional nibble from the garden using the new growth to mix in a spring green salad. Caution – Although comfrey has been used as a food crop, in the past 20 years scientific studies reported that comfrey may be carcinogenic, since it appeared to cause liver damage and cancerous tumors in rats. These reports have temporarily restricted development of comfrey as a food crop. In light of this, the regular consumption of comfrey is not advisable.  Life cycle – Herbaceous perennial Growth habit – Comfrey begins growth in early-April and by early May compact clusters of young leaves are visible in the crown of the old plant. Within a few weeks, the leaf blades with long petioles have grown to over 35cm high. Basal leaves are large, lance-shaped, stalked, and coarsely hairy. The leaves die back following the first frost and remain dormant for winter. Many species can spread vigorously via seed and are generally not welcome in the garden because of this. Other species can spread via tubers and all species quickly regenerate from broken root pieces.  Flowering – Starts in late May or early June and continues until the first frost in late autumn. The bell-shaped flowers with pedicels are in terminal cymes or one-sided clusters. Flowers of common comfrey are usually creamy yellow, but white, red, or purple types have been found in Europe. Prickly comfrey has pink and blue flowers while Russian comfrey has blue, purple, or red-purple flowers. Tuberous comfrey has creamy white flowers. Vegetative growth does not cease with the start of flowering, and the plant will add new stems continuously during the growing season. Most comfrey plants can be somewhat invasive, spreading via seed to parts of the garden where they are not wanted. ‘Bocking 14’ will flower and provide nectar and pollen but will not produce viable seed. Roots – Some species have short, thick, tuberous roots such as Symphytum tuberosum. Others such as Symphytum x uplandicum have deep and expansive root systems. Light – Needs full sun for good biomass production but grows fine in the shade. Shade – Tolerates light shade (about 50%). Moisture – Some species are drought tolerant e.g. Symphytum tuberosum. Cultivated plants require irrigation. USDA Hardiness Zone – 4-9 comfrey crowns and roots are very winter hardy.  Soil – Comfrey is adaptable to many soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils.  pH – Tolerates a wide range (6.5-8.5), although not very sensitive to soil pH, highest yields are reported to occur on soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Perhaps you’re interested in growing comfrey to feed your animals, for medicine, for mulch, for compost or you’re slightly masochistic and want to roll around naked in the pricky beds of biomass (not me). In any case, here’s how to do it. The plant we use in our gardens is Symphytum x uplandicum – ‘Bocking 14’. A sterile cultivar that produces copious quantities of nutrient dense biomass. The following information is based on using this plant.  Choosing the site – We’re growing for biomass and want the plants to receive as much light as possible. Accordingly, we lay out our beds on an east to west axis (we’re in the northern hemisphere).  Irrigation is necessary if you want to get good yields from the plants so picking a place with access to irrigation is of paramount important.  In areas of low rainfall, using the gradient of the land to channel precipitation towards your beds will reduce the water needs of your plants. In areas of high rainfall with a high water table you should consider diverting water away from the beds. Once established, comfrey is difficult to get rid of, so choose a site where you want it to stay. Don’t plant comfrey in any area you cultivate, as the broken root pieces quickly establish into new plants and can out compete slower growing crops.  Position comfrey downhill from where you expect leachate to be present, i.e downhill from a manure pile , compost heap, outside toilet, animal pen etc., can provide passive fertility to the plants and rescue otherwise lost minerals from draining away with the sub soil ground water. 
Grow the comfrey where you want to use it. As you’ll see later we may be harvesting over 1/4 ton biomass from our patch and don’t want to be carrying that over long distances. Preparing the site – Raised beds are a major part of our fertility strategy and overtime retain water and nutrients very efficiently. I use 1.3m wide beds surrounded by 50cm paths for our crops as this allows easy access for harvesting everywhere in the beds without ever having to tread on the soil and the paths are wise enough to take our lawnmower. To form a bed, the area should be cleared of all plants, which is best achieved by sheet mulching the season before. Pernicious perennials or tap rooted biennials should be dug out. After you have cleared the whole area, mark out the bed shape with string and dig out 50cm wide paths around your beds, applying the soil to the surface of the planting area and thereby creating the initial rise of the bed. Fork over the beds well. If a hardpan is present take the time and effort to eliminate it before planting. Depending on the quality of your soil you may want to add extra compost before planting into the bed. If you have sheet mulched the area before hand, with the additional soil from the paths all you need to do is add a good 20cm thick straw mulch (or some other mulch) and it’s ready for planting. A good mulch to start with will help keep the weeds down while your comfrey gets going. You can alter the depth and gradient of the paths to facilitate the required direction of water movement. Planting material – You can plant out with crown divisions or root cuttings best done in the spring when the soil has warmed. A crown division can be obtained from simply putting a spade through the center of a mature comfrey plant and transplanting the divided sections. For our beds, I divided two year old plants into quarters, sometimes sixths, and these established very well in the first year. It’s bests not to harvest the leaf biomass in the first year in order to allow a deep root system to develop. However if you use large divisions you can start harvesting in July. Root cuttings are a great way to plant out large areas of comfrey. The cuttings should be grown on in small pots with 50% compost 50% river sand mix kept moist and planted out in the spring as soon as the first leaves emerge and the soil has warmed. If you are planting large numbers of root cuttings you can plant directly into the beds by creating ‘nests’ in the straw, adding two cupped handfuls of the above mentioned potting mix and plant the cuttings into this. Keep them moist like a wrung out sponge and the success rate will be very close to 100%. Spacing – The plants should be spaced 60cm apart in rows and 60cm apart at diagonals between rows. Plant the rows 15cm from the edge of the beds. Cutting – In the first year allow the plants to establish so that the roots develop well and penetrate deep into the subsoil. Remove any weeds around the plants leaving them on the surface. The following year the cutting can begin. You can scythe the beds for a quick harvest or cut each plant individually with a pair of secateurs or shears cutting to 5cm or so from ground level. The leaves are prickly so if you have sensitive hands wear gloves. Cut the comfrey as the flowering stalks emerge up to four times a year. Allow the plants to flower at least once during the season to provide bee fodder to a range of native bees and honey bees. Leave the last flush of leaves before the winter so that invertebrates can find winter shelter in the undergrowth. You may need to weed between cuts every now and then but generally the comfrey will quickly cover the surface. Feeding – After you have cut the comfrey, mow the pathways between the beds and empty the trimmings to the base of the comfrey plants. Any trimmings from lawns and hedges in the surrounding area can also be used. We are experimenting with growing nitrogen fixing hedging and ground cover plants adjacent to the patch in order to feed our comfrey. A most excellent comfrey feed is undiluted urine applied at a rate of approx 500 ml per plant twice per growing season. Irrigation – Comfrey will produce more biomass if irrigated and in dry climates it’s essential to irrigate. Comfrey plants wilt very fast in hot conditions and will stop photosynthesising at this point. Twenty litres per m2 per week of drought should be more than adequate. The beauty of biological systems are that, if managed properly, each year the soils improve and the ability of the soil to store water will improve over time. We use passive irrigation diverting water from a mountain stream into the paths around the beds. The paths fill with water, we raise the level by blocking the low points with sacks of sawdust and the water is drawn throughout the soil via capillary action. Passive irrigation in our market garden. The paths fill with water and the water permeates throughout the soil via capillary action. As mulch – Freshly cut comfrey leaves make good mulch because they have high nitrogen content, and don’t pull nitrogen from the soil while decomposing. Comfrey’s high potassium content makes it especially beneficial for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, berries, and fruit trees. With adequate feed and watering we’ve seen yields of 2-3kg of biomass per plant per cut. Comfrey beds establishing well. This bed was planted with divided crowns 5 months prior to this photo being taken. Liquid fertliser – What I like to call ‘Comfert’. Fill a barrel, preferably with a bottom tap and a gauze on the inside (to prevent clogging) about 3/4 full with freshly cut comfrey and add water to fill the barrel. Cover it, and let it steep for 3-6 weeks. The smell from the resulting liquid is far from attractive so approach with caution. The tea may be used full strength or diluted by half or more. Don’t apply before heavy rain is forecast as most of the nutrients suspended in the liquid will wash straight through the soil. For the best results apply the feed to your vegetables when they are in most need of the extra fertility. This will be different for each crop, for example, tomatoes are best fed when they are setting fruit and then any time during the fruiting period. Applying comfert before this can be counter productive and make your plants more susceptible to pest problems. The black slurry at the bottom of the barrel can be dispersed evenly back over the comfrey patch. Liquid fertilizer concentrate – ‘Comfert Plus’ can also be made by packing fresh-cut comfrey tops into an old bucket, weighing them down with something heavy, covering tightly, and waiting a few weeks for them to decompose into a black slurry. You can put a hole in the bottom of the bucket and collect the concentrate in another container as it drips out. Dilute this comfrey concentrate about 15 to 1 with water, and use as you would comfert. You can seal this concentrate in plastic jugs until you are ready to use it. Warning! Comfert stinks like hell. My nieces came to visit from London last year and offered to help out in the market garden. One of the tasks that day was to apply comfert to the crops. Let’s just say it did not end well and we had a much better experience taking softwood cuttings the next day. According to Martin Crawford in Creating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops, one cut of comfrey from one plant contains 0.5g of Nitrogen (N) and 10g of potassium (K) to crops. Based on this I calculated how much Potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and biomass the 13 m2 comfrey patch can potentially produce in a year. Below is a table indicating how many comfrey cuts are needed to meet the Nitrogen and Potassium needs of various moderate and heavy cropping fruit and nut trees and annual vegetables. In the 1960s, Lawrence D. Hills used UK gardeners records for a comfrey report. (See the Balkan Ecology Project blog for the results.) Based on these records I calculated a yield of approx. 5.5kg of biomass per plant each year. Using this figure one of our beds should produce approx 286kg of biomass. We shall see as this year we begin our own records. We’re looking to gather some solid data on how comfrey performs in our climate and we’ll be recording the yields from our patch starting this season and for at least the next five years. For more info on our record keeping and research programs see Polyculture Market Garden Study. If you would like to join the ‘who can grow the most comfrey’ experiment and contribute data to our records, send us an email. It will be great to have records from all over the world.

"Hugelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, means hill culture or hill mound. Instead of putting branches, leaves and grass clippings in bags by the curbside for the bin men… build a hugel bed. Simply mound logs, branches, leaves, grass clippings, straw, cardboard, petroleum-free newspaper, manure, compost or whatever other biomass you have available, top with soil and plant your veggies. The advantages of a hugel bed are many, including: The gradual decay of wood is a consistent source of long-term nutrients for the plants. A large bed might give out a constant supply of nutrients for 20 years (or even longer if you use only hardwoods). The composting wood also generates heat which should extend the growing season. Soil aeration increases as those branches and logs break down… meaning the bed will be no till, long term. The logs and branches act like a sponge. Rainwater is stored and then released during drier times. Actually you may never need to water your hugel bed again after the first year (except during long term droughts). Sequester carbon into the soil. On a sod lawn Sepp Holzer (hugelkultur expert) recommends cutting out the sod, digging a one foot deep trench and filling the trench with logs and branches. Then cover the logs with the upside down turf. On top of the turf add grass clippings, seaweed, compost, aged manure, straw, green leaves, mulch, etc…  Sepp Holzer recommends steep hugel beds to avoid compaction from increased pressure over time. Steep beds mean more surface area in your garden for plants and the height makes easy harvesting. The greater the mass, the greater the water-retention benefits. Hugel bed dug in clay with logs put in vertically, next branches and lots of wood chips. Top 6 inches will be wood chips and dirt. This bed will store water and give nutrients for many years to come. Straw bale gardens require less soil, less water and hold heat. As the straw breaks down nutrients feed the plants. Combining a straw surround with a hugel interior, topped by lasagne layering is an excellent idea for an area with poor quality soil. Hugel bed in Ontario, Canada (June 28th) by Tim Burrows. Tim surrounded his very tall hugel bed in pallets! Sheet mulching (lasagne gardening) is like composting in place. Above: just a suggestion as to sheet mulching layers. Nitrogen-rich material such as fresh grass clippings or green leaves put right on the hugelkultur wood would help jump start the composting process. Could also include seaweed, straw, dead leaves, leaf mould, etc.

The first year of break down means the wood (and fungi) steal a lot of the nitrogen out of the surrounding environment, so adding nitrogen during the first year or planting crops that add nitrogen to the soil (like legumes) or planting species with minimal nitrogen requirements is necessary, unless there is plenty of organic material on top of the wood. After the wood absorbs nitrogen to its fill, the wood will start to break down and start to give nitrogen back in the process. In the end you will be left with a beautiful bed of nutrient rich soil. Tree types that work well in hugelkultur:
Hardwoods break down slowly and therefore your hugel bed will last longer, hold water for more years and add nutrients for more years. But softwoods are acceptable as well, a softwood bed will just disintegrate quicker. Mixing woods with softwoods and branches on top, to give off nutrients first, and hardwoods on bottom, sounds like a plan if you have access to multiple types of wood. Yet the newly decomposing softwoods at the top will eat up a lot of nitrogen at first, so compensate for that.

Woods that work best:
Alders, apple, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, oak, poplar, willow (make sure it is dead or it will sprout).

Trees types that work okay:
Black cherry (use only rotted), camphor wood (well aged), cedar/juniper/yew (anti-microbial/anti-fungal, so use only at very bottom or unless already well-aged. Cedar should be broken down before new plant roots reach it), eucalyptus (slightly anti-microbial), osage orange (exceptionally resistant to decay), Pacific yew (exceptionally resistant to decay), pine/fir/spruce (tannins and sap), red mulberry (exceptionally resistant to decay).

Tree types to avoid:
Black locust (will not decompose), black walnut (juglone toxin), old growth redwood (heartwood will not decompose and redwood compost can prevent seed germination).

"Thistles are a bane of picnickers and campers. Who hasn’t trodden on the sharp, unforgiving spines of a thistle when out and about barefoot in grasslands? For many people, relationships with thistles have generally been painful and irritable, but now you can get your own back! One of the great things about thistles is that every single species is edible, so this is great news for foraging beginners! Even the closest lookalikes found here are edible – the sow thistles (Sonchus spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), so when working with the thistles, you can learn to identify and proceed to experiment with complete confidence from the outset. We have at least 14 species of thistle growing wild in the UK, mostly from the Cirsium (aka plume thistles) and Carduus genera. Thistles are found in numerous settings all over our islands and can be a useful soil barometer. Often their presence signifies that the land is fertile, and in many instances, neglected. I eat from a number of different species. These are: creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis), spear thistle (C. vulgare), woolly thistle (C. eriophorum), marsh thistle (C. palustris), and welted thistle (Carduus acanthoides syn C. crispus). As you will discover, plants that have spines to offer protection against predators, have no real need for bitterness. Spear thistle It’s almost impossible to misidentify a thistle. One of the easy-to-spot botanical differences between thistles and their numerous relatives in the daisy family, is that the overlapping bracts (involucre) found directly below the flowers of thistles, are always spiny. Simple! The leaves of the numerous species will differ in size, shape and the density of spine coverage. Most have stiff spines on the margins, but some have soft prickles. You need to discover for yourself which are the more tactile! When in flower, most thistles produce a lovely purple / mauve bloom, but some species are known for their yellow inflorescence (cabbage thistle – Cirsium oleraceum and the Carline thistle – Carlina vulgaris). In all of the thistles, flowers give way to copious amounts of fluffy hairs (pappus) attached to their tiny fruits, superbly designed for air-borne dispersal. A distinguishing feature between the two main generais that Cirsium spp. produce feathered pappus hairs, whereas Carduus spp. only have simple pappus hairs. Creeping thistle produces dense spines on its leaves, but very few spines or hairs on the flowering stems. Spear thistle has large, deeply-lobed leaves with large spines at the margins, as well as hairy, spiny stems. Marsh thistle looks somewhat like spear thistle at an initial glance, but without the large spines and leaf lobes, and usually with a thin, red, leaf margin. Woolly thistle is easily identifiable with large, deeply-lobed, evenly-shaped leaves, and very large flower heads, wrapped in a ‘cobweb’ of cotton-like hairs. This particular species is the largest wild thistle I use, although if you have milk thistle (Silybum marianum) growing in your plot, you can use that too, but you will need good gloves to protect yourself from its long spiny flower heads! Eating milk thistle chokes would of course prevent you harvesting the exceptional liver-supportive medicine found in the seeds. Wooly thistle Creeping thistle will grow in all manner of waste-ground, grasslands, verges and field edges. I also see a lot of spear thistle in similar habitats, although when found in grassland, it’s not as abundant as the creeping species. The root systems explain why; spear thistle has a tap root, whereas creeping thistle grows on rhizomes. The marsh thistle, as its name alludes to, likes damp conditions such as fens, marshes, canal tow-paths and riversides. Woolly thistle is a little bit more selective in its choice of soil and setting, preferring calcareous ground. It too enjoys grasslands. Welted thistle can be found all over the UK, especially loving clay soils. Go prepared! Stiff gloves and a knife are required. Harvest the best leaf mid-ribs in spring when growth is plentiful and quick. Your specimens will be tender and sweeter. Flowering stems will appear from late spring through into autumn. I only consider harvesting from plants whose flower buds are yet to really begin unfurling. Flower buds (chokes) are available all summer. In Portugal, a number of thistle species are still collected in spring and sold at markets. A recent academic study highlighted the nutritional value from eating thistles. The findings are contained within ‘Ethnobotany In The New Europe’ by Manuel. P de Santayana et al. (Eds), published June 2010. In the study, researchers noted the wide range of thistle species collected, and concentrated on the nutritional value of one particular thistle (Scolymus hispanicus – Spanish or golden thistle). This plant is collected by villagers in various areas of the countryside. Bunches of the stripped leaf mid-ribs are sold and bought in a number of markets in different areas. Levels of certain nutrients were analysed and compared to some commonly consumed vegetables. Their findings show that the thistle contained consistently higher levels of important major nutrients than some of our commonly consumed cultivated vegetables. Weight for weight, thistles come out higher in fibre, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc and other nutrients. Is it likely that the thistles found wild here will be similarly endowed with a range of important vitamins and minerals? I’m more than happy to work on the assumption that this will be the case. Many other wild plant species are known to contain high concentrations of important nutrients. Preparing thistles is pretty easy. Simply choose the most tender specimens. If using the petioles, then cut and strip all the spines off, before peeling the outer, fibrous layer from the stalk. Use raw as crudités, pickle or ferment them, or chop into salads and serve them with a tangy vinaigrette. If cooking, they don’t require long! Preparing the stems is similar, but they are hollow. These can be used in similar ways to the petioles, or you can stuff them, roast them, and braise them. As relatives of the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), thistles produce edible, if smaller, ‘chokes’. These are the crunchy, immature bases, or capitulum, of the composite flower-head. As you would do with globe artichokes, peel away the bracts to get to the prize. I only choose the largest wild species for this. Happy foraging!

"Some plants seem to be our constant companions, no matter where we live. Often, they will also be some of our really useful species. It will soon become clear that the common mallow (Malva sylvestris) is one of these plants. Rather than being looked upon as a weed, the mallows can be more usefully described as some of our gloriously abundant plant helpers. A number of mallow species have long been used as a food and medicine, wherever they are found native, and especially in the Middle East and Asia. You won’t have far to go to find the common mallow in most parts of Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia either. Common mallow can be found growing erect or prostrate, which may initially cause confusion because it’s easy to assume they might be two different species. Mallow’s kidney-shaped or palmately-lobed leaves are notably creased, typically with dentate margins. The leaves often show a purple spot in the centre of the base of the leaf and this can also be seen to run down the petiole on some specimens. On other specimens, the purple spotting and colouring is completely absent. Mallow leaves have long petioles. Their deep green foliage hints at a renowned drought tolerance. During flowering, the leaves appear alternately on the stems. Holding a leaf relays the surface coarseness. But tear and crush one, and you discover a family pattern – the mucilage. You will soon experience a slimy and tacky feel between your fingers. All parts of the plant contain mucilage. In bloom, the Malvaceae family plants produce five large notched petals in each open flower. Common mallow has showy pink petals laced with darker-coloured strokes. In the centre of the flower lies a pollen-loaded column of fused stamens. This surrounds the stigma, which rises above the column.  Mallow is known to freely seed. The round seed pods, known as ‘cheeses’, soon follow flowering. These were once munched by children on their way to and from school. The pods are held on stalks, close to the flowering stem. Mallow will be found on most soils, from coastal to marginally upland habitats, with most settings being adequate for this resilient plant. It loves waste-ground as well as grassland; gravel as much as coastal edges, and waysides and roadsides as well as hedges.  Leaves, flowers, seed pods, roots. Leaves, in spring; flowers from late spring; seed pods from early summer. Roots could be harvested from larger rosettes whenever large enough. Medicinal and nutritional constituents Vitamins A,B,C,E; inulin; mucilage; phenols; flavonoids; essential fatty acids; fibre; calcium; magnesium; zinc; selenium; potassium. Traditional and contemporary uses As with many wild food plants, the common mallow has also had a long history of medicinal use. Due to its high mucilage content, mallows make excellent soothing demulcent herbs, especially for cases of inflammation, either for the urinary, digestive or respiratory systems. Pregnant women or new mothers may like to know that mallow leaves can provide useful amounts of iron, as well as being quite high in zinc and most vitamins.  All of the mallow family with exception to the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum), are reportedly edible. With their high mucilage content, the leaves can usefully be taken as an emergency antidote to irritation or burning that may be caused by the accidental consumption of acrid plants in the buttercup family. Creative cooks can substitute mallow for spinach in many dishes, including soups, salads, gnocchi and quiche. I have even flash-fried larger mallow leaves for just one second in hot oil to make ‘popadoms’. Mallow also makes a great addition to soups, whereby the mucilage helps to thicken them.  In Jewish culture, mallow has been been considered the ‘most important plant in local gather society’. Every spring mallow is gathered in the countryside. Its common name in both Hebrew and Arabic, translates to ‘bread’.  During the war of 1948, when Jerusalem was under siege, mallow was an important famine crop, and one that is still celebrated on Independence day every year with a traditional dish made from mallow leaves. Common mallow can be substituted for the family relative Corchorus olitorius aka ‘jutes mallow’, when making the Egyptian / Middle-Eastern dish ‘Molokhia’. This traditional dish is usually served with chicken.  In China, mallow roots are a popular and a common ingredient in making hearty, yet medicinally potent soups and broths. The inulin-rich tap roots of a number of different mallow species, including common mallow, have been used. The seed pods can be substituted for most of the egg white if wanting to make mallow meringues. Simply boil up the peeled seed pods using 3 parts water 1 part seed pods, and reduce the liquid by half. For every half cup of liquid add one egg white, ¼ tsp of cream of tartar, some vanilla and castor sugar, then whip it up until foamy and stiff, just like meringues.  21st Century Foraging  The Medicinal Forest Garden  The Fast Wild Food Cookbookby Johnny Jumbalaya  Amazing Moringa: Medicinal, Edible & Easy to Grow  How to Make your own Sloe Gin Chris Hope, aka Chris Phyto, was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic plant lover, forager and teacher, who sadly died in 2021.";Permaculture Magazine UK

Plus 2 or 3 tomatoes, sliced, to decorate
240g (8.5 oz/1.5 cups) cooked beans
(400g tin, drained)
1-2 tbsp chopped herbs – basil, parsley or oregano (or a mixture of all three)
Salt and pepper to taste For the garlic bread
A crusty loaf of bread 
4-10 cloves garlic (I like it strong!)
0.5-1 cup olive oil (it depends how large the loaf is)
Pepper
An oven dish approximately 25 x 25cm (10 x 10in) Preheat the oven to 180oC fan (200oC/400oF/gas mark 6). Finely chop the garlic and mix into the olive oil. Add a little pepper, stir and leave to infuse. Slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways into 5mm thick slices. Pour some olive oil into the pan and soften the onions, garlic and celery on a low heat.  When cooked, add the red pepper, beans and tomatoes. Simmer for around 15 minutes until the sauce is cooked through. Meanwhile, drizzle olive oil onto a griddle and cook the aubergines and courgettes, several slices at a time, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Pour some of the tomato sauce into the oven dish, add a layer of aubergine, then more sauce, a layer of courgette, and so on until the dish is filled with layers of sauce, aubergine and courgette. Decorate with slices of tomato. Put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Slice the bread so the knife goes about 90% through the loaf, leaving the base intact and the slices attached to each other. Put in a baking dish and, using a spoon, drizzle the garlic oil over both sides of each slice.  15 minutes before the lasagne is ready, put the bread in the oven. When the lasagne is cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the crusty garlic bread and a large salad, or dish of steamed seasonal green vegetables. Tip – Frying pan will work if you don’t have a griddle. This recipe adapts well to other vegetables. In the winter, use slices of cooked potato, parsnip, sweet potato or squash.

"My name is Suzanne Pendleton and I live in Swinton, Salford (UK) and have been involved in the Greater Manchester Swift Street initiative since August 2024, which has been led by the RSPB. During lockdown I started to value my time outside as so many families did too. I enjoyed time in our little garden more and spotted some birds as they zoomed and screamed over the house. I wasn’t quite sure what they were and asked my friend Kathleen who lived on a surrounding road what they might be. She enlightened me. They were Swifts, a species recently added to the UK’s Red List of birds, meaning they are now amongst our most threatened. Then the summer was over and the swifts left Swinton heading back to Africa.  Each year since, I have eagerly anticipated the return of the Swifts. My understanding grew and I learnt of their declining numbers, now less than 60,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Along with developing a stiff neck constantly looking up to the sky, watching their incredible aerial manoeuvres.  I am privileged to live in a friendly neighbourhood on our lane. The community are always up for helping, and we pull together to help each other. We have a community messaging service which came into its own in lockdown, and continues to be a fabulous way to share information and request help and advice. During the last few years I had messaged our community group and asked if anyone knew about our Swifts and where they were nesting. Initially we were unsuccessful in understanding, but in spring 2024 we struck lucky and finally worked out the eaves where they lived. I’d also discovered Swift Mapper (an app for recording the location of Swift nesting sites) enabling us to understand we had four nest sites on the Lane and surrounding roads.  We also realised that there was another small colony locally less that 1/4 mile away. Last August, a resident of this local road got in touch to say Roshni (Parmar-Hill, Community Engagement Officer) from the RSPB had been to visit their colony. She asked if we’d be interested in getting involved with developing our Swift Street – thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery – and I eagerly accepted the offer. We used our community messaging group to share the news of the Swift Street development and I was overwhelmed by the local response. So many families were keen to help our Swift population, with more than 80 boxes requested. I think the consensus was that we are so privileged that these incredible urban birds choose our lane as their home, and as their nesting places can be threatened by redevelopment, having the opportunity to install boxes is a wonderful chance to do something proactive to help.  Roshni and I visited local homes who had expressed interest, helping families select potential sites for their boxes to be positioned. With Roshni’s guidance we talked about what Swifts need and I and residents began to understand more about how Swifts live. They are remarkably compatible with humans, don’t need a bird bath, bird table etc. as they feed on insects on the wing. I discovered along with other residents that the best way we could help our Swifts was to protect their current nesting sites, add boxes for more birds to nest in and to do all we could to support insect populations. For example, considering planting in our gardens to promote insect life, adopting No Mow May and not using insecticides. Those who weren’t able to install a box could instead help in other ways, so this made the project accessible for all – everyone could join in. Next came the production of the boxes. Roshni contacted local colleges and we were thrilled when a local skills centre suggested their joinery students could make these free of charge. Production began and numbers of those interested had grown as the message about the project spread, and so 100 boxes were produced.  Meanwhile, local guiding groups learnt of the initiative and Roshni visited the groups that I lead, as Brown Owl – 90 girls and young women were keen to learn about Swifts and how they could help. The groups were already keen to learn about environmental matters, and this project really whetted their appetite. The Brownies, Guides and Rangers designed posters, made seed bombs and grew in their understanding of our Swifts. Once the production of the boxes was finished the Brownies, Rangers and Guides got stuck into painting them with an environmentally friendly product which would protect the boxes, and a local lady Haldis (a RSPB Swift Champion, a voluntary role which supports local conservation efforts to protect the species) made the nest cups which would be inserted into each box.  We arrived at installation day on Saturday 8th March, with 25 boxes going up on that first day. By the end of March, 80 had been erected by a local roofer, Ryan. Of course, we needed to celebrate the returning of our precious Swifts and so we began planning our community event. Volunteers came forward from the surrounding roads and we met in a resident’s kitchen each Wednesday, so all could contribute ideas. Other local guiding groups wanted to contribute and so they made nature-themed bunting, and we were thrilled when the church on the lane offered their venue as a space for us to celebrate. The local dance and drama group wanted to be involved and so their leaders and young people planned songs and a drama production with poetry. And as if we weren’t already exciting enough, we then heard the news that RSPB Ambassador Megan McCubbin would love to come along to formally open our Swift Street.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on 17th May, with a fantastic community event. Sixty families made bee hotels, children had Swift-themed face paint, and a plant swap was popular. RSPB provided and led crafts, and local artists supported youngsters to make Swift puppets. More than 300 residents attended and watched the young people perform. The ribbon was cut revealing a beautiful Swift Street banner created by a local artist, alongside Swift boxes 99 and 100 positioned proudly on the front of the church. And yes, we had Swifts soaring high above us all day (perhaps watching the proceedings?) to the delight of the watching children and residents. As the street party continued into the evening we couldn’t believe our eyes when a ‘banger’ (a young Swift, which gets its name from its tendency to bang against prospective nest to check if they’re occupied or not) attempted to enter one of the newly positioned boxes. A perfect end to a fabulous day.  It’s been an absolute honour to be involved in this project and I feel so lucky that our community have been able to do something practical to support our local Swifts.

Founded in 2004, it was born out of the return of its founders to their community after experiencing the negative impacts of conventional agriculture and agrochemicals. This return marked the beginning of a path towards reconnecting with indigenous ancestral knowledge and adopting permaculture and organic production. One of the key achievements has been the recovery of soils degraded by monocultures and eucalyptus. Although slow, this process has demonstrated the benefits of a regenerative approach and strengthened the resilience of the community. Allpa Tarpuna is currently focusing on: Allpa Tarpuna integrates bio-construction, renewable energy and sustainable water management into its practices. It also encourages the preservation of ancestral seeds and agro-ecological techniques such as crop rotation, reducing dependence on chemicals. In the future, it wants to expand its training in permaculture design, combining indigenous knowledge with modern regenerative solutions. It seeks to empower more local farmers, promoting designs that restore the connection between people and nature. Allpa Tarpuna is a living indigenous family that sows regeneration, inspiring a sustainable and resilient balance. https://allpatarpuna.org HortaFCUL is a community-based permaculture project based in Lisbon University’s Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). The initiative was launched by a group of biology students concerned about the gap between sustainability ideals and the university’s environmental impact. This bottom-up project has developed an important role as a catalyst of practical scientific-based knowledge. Nowadays, HortaFCUL is a resilient, sustainable and inclusive community, allowing the general public to learn more about nature-based solutions.

"As politicians wait, grassroots changemakers are restoring ecosystems and rebuilding resilience. They are living examples that regeneration is not just possible, it’s already happening all over the world.  The Lush Spring Prize 2025 is showcasing this work and has awarded around £250,000 to 19 groups, celebrating regenerative organisations and practitioners from around the world. Lead image: Clockwise from top left: Agro-Pueblos (Colombia), Ñu’u Ndito (Mexico), Global Ecovillage Network (Global), Land in Our Names (UK) In a joyous, collaborative and inspiring week of celebrations, the 2025 recipients were honoured as part of a celebratory event held in Dorset (UK), where the Lush Cosmetics company is headquartered. The event was attended by prize recipients, Spring Prize judges, Lush staff, press, funders and other regenerative practitioners. Co-designed with the prize recipients themselves, the event provides a space to connect, co-learn and share stories of regeneration. It offered an opportunity to explore both the diversity of people and organisations that make up the regenerative movement and the common challenges, learnings and successes that unites it. Each Spring Prize year sees different themes emerge that are shaped by the organisations that receive a prize. In 2025, these include the importance of weaving ancestral wisdom with scientific approaches; working at multiple scales and legally recognising the rights of nature, and learning from those on the frontlines that are facilitating regenerative work in conflict zones or regions experiencing natural disasters. In 2025, the backdrop of violence and conflict looms large. Prize recipients from Lebanon and Ukraine are responding to invasions by powerful aggressors, in Myanmar they are working in a context of ongoing internal conflict and many of the Indigenous groups are frequently facing the threat of violence.  The Spring Prize 2025 event allows these groups to come together and share what regenerative work in these situations looks like in a way that may challenge the existing narrative: “In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the biggest achievement for our organisation is to continue our activities and find ways to be useful for Ukrainian society like creating permaculture public spaces and rehabilitating people in our demonstration centers. The war has taught us that strength is in unity and networks, that autonomous homesteads and farms that grow their own food and preserve their seeds can not only survive but also help other people, and that international support and networks matter.” NGO Permaculture in Ukraine While humanity witnesses declining biodiversity, climate catastrophes and widespread conflict, these organisations highlight how regenerative practices are not just a source of hope but a necessary and much needed response.

Examples of this year’s awarded projects include: Aguaje palm tree seedlings were distributed among Kukama families in Parinari, Loreto, Peru, as part of the reforestation and conservation initiative led by Huaynakana. Extractivism represents a constant threat to the Kukama territory in Peru and the loss of the Kukama peoples’ cultural identity. Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana exists to protect this. The Kukama people conceive of the territory as a whole and women having an intrinsic connection to it. The term ‘kukama’ for example is composed of two words: ‘ku’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘kama’ meaning ‘bosom,’ and it signifies ‘field-bosom’ or ‘nourished by the field.’ Given the Kukama peoples’ lives are reliant on the forest ecosystems of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and considering how they have adapted and coexisted with them for decades, the territory and the rivers are inseparable from their culture and way of life. They consider the rivers to be living beings with spirits, and therefore sacred. Founded in 2001, Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana embarked on a long journey of collective actions, protests, and mobilisations in pursuit of environmental justice as the river’s health declined as a result of extractive industries. In September 2021 Huaynakana filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognise the Marañón River as a living being and subject of rights. In March 2024, the provincial court of Nauta ruled that the Marañón River has intrinsic rights, including the right to flow, to be free from pollution, and to be restored to environmental health. This decision also recognised Indigenous communities as the river’s legal representatives, defenders, and guardians. This landmark ruling was ratified by the higher court last November. Huaynakana plays a key role in defending the Marañón’s rights and supporting the regeneration and conservation of the waterways through reforestation efforts because without the river, these unique forests cannot exist. Mushrooms harvested from the Ubuntu food forest Ubuntu Learning Hub Trust was set up in 2022 with a mission to support people who are in transition towards more resilient futures and a healthier planet. The Trust immediately began to set up the Ubuntu Learning Centre as an open learning space for all ages as well as a demonstration centre for integrating technologies that are in tune with a healthy Mother Earth. The learning centre sits on a two-hectare site in Chikancila village in Chongwe district of Lusaka Province of Zambia. It is founded on the African philosophy of Ubuntu which helps people to learn what it means to be truly human. It hosts people from all walks of life who are looking for pathways to escape the rat race and curve more sustainable futures for themselves, their families and the communities where they come from. The Trust uses agro-ecological practices to regenerate the degraded farmland that was damaged over decades of poor land husbandry. For example, the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) technique has helped to restore much of the indigenous vegetation on the land. People come to Ubuntu to explore the meaning of life and to find their life purpose. They stay at Ubuntu for varying lengths of time and in the process they are engaged in intercultural exchanges as well as learning how to take care of themselves and of Mother Earth. The Trust offers life changing experiences rather than certificates and the opportunity to carve out an earth-centred worldview for themselves. The Cultural Conservancy (TCC) Farm Manager, Amythest Faria, at TCC’s land project Heron Shadow, collecting an early fall harvest. The Cultural Conservancy (TCC) is a Native-led non-profit organisation based in San Francisco, California. Founded in 1985, its mission is to protect and revitalise Indigenous cultures through the direct application of traditional knowledge and practices on ancestral lands. It works with Native/Indigenous peoples locally and globally on community-based projects that are shaped by community requests and guided by the Native Advisory Council of Traditional Knowledge Holders, land-care practitioners, and community leaders. From language revitalisation and traditional carving projects to Indigenous agricultural sciences and traditional land tending, critical to its work is the acknowledgement of the sacred relationship Native peoples have to their lands and waters and the importance of this relationship to their physical, mental, and community health. Through its flagship Native Foodways Programme and its land project Heron Shadow, it: Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Harvesting with Battmung friends The LUSH Spring Prize is a joint venture between LUSH Cosmetics and Ethical Consumer and is now in its sixth prize cycle, having started in 2017. The Spring Prize has distributed more than £1.3 million to regenerative projects worldwide. The LUSH Spring Prize was set up to support ‘regenerative’ projects – those that go beyond sustainability by taking holistic approaches to building the health of ecology, economy and social systems. It seeks to support those who are leaving the world lusher than they found it, and are actively restoring all the systems they are part of. By supporting regenerative projects the Spring Prize hopes to raise the profile of the movement as a whole to inspire more individuals, groups, communities, funders, media platforms and businesses to start engaging with regenerative processes.  The Spring Prize judging panels are made up of people drawn from a diverse range of movements that represent regenerative design, permaculture, food sovereignty, transition towns, biomimicry, eco-village networks and various social justice movements. Each prize cycle a ‘Lush Customer Judge’ and ‘Lush Staff Judge’ are also selected to act as additional independent members of the judging panel.  The collaborative prizes have separate panels, which also include judges from the main Spring Prize panel. The majority of the judging panel for the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Award self identify as Indigenous themselves, some being previous recipients of the award. The judges are not just involved in choosing the recipients but are involved in shaping the prize as a whole, attending the event and connecting with prize recipients.

"Around 40 years ago, the Sahel, an extremely arid region located in central Africa, was an area of agricultural desolation. Due to natural factors such as heavy drought and interannual variability, combined with anthropocentric influences like climate change, overgrazing and deforestation, the environment has become particularly unstable with little possibility for productivity.  Furthermore, when rain does fall in the arid region, the soil is so dry due to a lack of precipitation, that water immediately ‘runs off’ or evaporates, failing to soak into the depleted earth. Some countries within the region, such as Burkina Faso, faced up to 24% of their arable lands classed as highly degraded in 1998 (Maatman et al., 1998).  In the early 2000s, NGOs and organisations such as the United Nations, the World Food Programme and WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), amongst others, sought to reverse the desertification of many parts of Africa, including the Sahel, in cooperation with farmers and communities from the affected regions. Using the ancient ‘half moon’ water harvesting technique – used for centuries in Africa and the Middle East, the revitalised technique aims to facilitate water retention and re-green the ecosystem. Heavy machinery or hand tools can be used to plough the soil roughly 30cm down in a semi-circle or ‘half moon’ shape. The diameter of these half moons are typically about 4 metres. When it rains, the contours catch the rainwater, preventing runoff and allowing it to infiltrate the soil. This creates ‘favourable micro-climate conditions’ allowing drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet to be planted.  If planted on steep slopes, half-moon ‘bunds’ can assist the growth of tree species. They can also be used in combination with controlled grazing to boost re-vegetation. In Niger, The World Food Programme (WFP) has been implementing half-moon planting projects since 2014. Just 5 years into the scheme, the benefits of its implementation were examined by a progress-review. In 2019, over 400 households had restored approximately 3,000 acres of land, largely for use in producing food for livestock. This has promoted social cohesion and economic growth by providing more jobs and stabilising agricultural output in a formerly capricious climate. This scenario exhibits the benefits of a localised, small-scale regenerative farming technique such as half-moon planting through its trickle-down effects, stipulating broader socio-economic growth. A study on the impact of reformed agroecological techniques was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Burkina Faso. Figures revealed that fields ploughed using the half-moon method saw the rates of increase for grain yield at 8% (The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 2017). As farmers sought new ways to boost crop yields, regenerative farming techniques such as the half-moon method were found to be successful when used in conjunction with others. In Burkina Faso, half-moon planting is exercised alongside the Zaï technique, which is useful when adapting to various soil types and structures. The Zaï method, suitable to the arid Sahel region, uses similar methods seen in the half-moons, but alternatively involves digging smaller pits in non-permeable soil to intercept water and gather compost material. These pits are slightly smaller than the half-moons and so are less labour intensive and can be utilised in smaller growing plots. They are roughly between 15-50cm across; 5-15cm deep; and positioned 80cm apart. This technique was reintroduced to the area in the 1980s by farmer and agronomist Yacouba Sawadogo, who pioneered the method of filling the holes with manure to further break up the earth and bolster soil productivity.

"Traditional Māori time systems were measured in accordance to the night as opposed to the Western proxy of daylight. Each night of the lunar month had a particular name and this cumulatively formed a lunar calendar known as ‘Maramataka‘. Farming according to the Maramataka lunar calendar is used in conjunction with Māori regenerative farming techniques to adapt to nature’s schedule as opposed to imposing controls on the earth’s processes. Many farmers are now seeking to turn back to these ancient methods in line with broader sustainability imperatives. Under the Maramataka calendar, individual lunar nights were marked according to how optimal they were for catching fish, eels or planting crops, with each night having its own name. A good example is eel fishing. It is not productive on a full moon – Rākaunui – because the moon’s light would not allow eel to hunt their prey, as the prey could see them. As with biodynamics (the Rudolf Steiner lunar approach for farming), planting crops is nest at a full moon, when the gravitational pull is at its highest, because it has maximum influence on water in the soil. “Despite the use of Maramataka being limited to a relative few today, largely because of colonisation, interest in and revival of this knowledge and practice is growing.”1 Many farmers are returning to the use of farming tactics such as Maramataka planting in line with broader regenerative goals. The Revitalise Te Taiao programme aims to fund sustainable and lucrative agribusiness solutions to cultivate Te Taiao (the natural world). This project provided $2.7 million in funding to Miru Young and Mohi Beckham, farmers based in the North Island’s Bay of Plenty, to trial agriculture techniques which aim to “enhance the mana and mauri of the soil” across 10 farm sites. As part of the scheme, both farmers undertook rigorous research, sowing pasture throughout different moon phases from resting and dormant phases to high-energy phases for plant growth. Soon, grass seeds sown during the high energy periods of the Maramataka calendar outgrew neighbouring crops planted in other phases, even if the latter had been sown 10 days before. Despite still being in the trial stages of Maramataka planting, Miru and Mohi observed various positive impacts of the scheme within the first few months. Their land has seen higher productivity and crop yields, with a 93% crop survival rate under Maramataka planting, that is an increase of 13% from the usual 80% under previous methods. One of the main issues associated with returning to traditional farming methods on a broader scale is competing with intensive methods in New Zealand’s modern agricultural industry. After settlers from the West arrived in New Zealand during the 18th and 19th centuries, intensive farming practices quickly became widespread.  As farming in the country has continuously expanded into the modern day, with agricultural exports making up a large proportion of the country’s GDP, traditional farming methods have become far less lucrative in the broader market. This meant that Māori farmers had to adopt newer techniques, as those trying to maintain the traditional methods were faced with far lower crop yields and income. Rural management programmes and sustainability objectives are constantly investigating new and feasible ways to rejuvenate te ao Māori farming techniques, with the Revitalise Te Taiao programme representing just one of many schemes. The Maramataka lunar calendar is part of a broader Maori worldview known as Mātauranga Māori – a term used to describe the collective knowledge of Māori living in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the knowledge passed down from their ancestors. Kaitiakitanga (stewardship/management) and the link between Whakapapa (Māori genealogy/ancestral descent) and Whenua (land) are key areas of te ao Māori and Mātauranga values.  By embracing schools of thought that are native to Aotearoa, alongside promoting equitable stewardship across modern farming methodologies, high agricultural output can be attained. Reforming the agribusiness in New Zealand will involve reintegrating Māori into decision making processes, embracing cross-cultural thought processes and utilising western technological advancements for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.

"Lammas is a celebration of the summer and the gathering in of the grain harvest. This was especially significant in the past. After all the hard work of getting the grain crop cut, threshed, stored and stacked, there came a time for feasting, celebration and assessment. Lammas is a Saxon name meaning ‘Loaf-mass’. Lughnasadh (pronounced Loo-nas-ah) is Irish Gaelic. On Lammas Eve fires were lit on Lammas mounds such as Silbury Hill at Avebury, to honour the Corn Mother as she gives birth to her harvest child, the Grain. This is the seed that will bring next year’s harvest as well as the grain that will sustain life throughout the winter. The month of August was the month of the Grain Mother. An ‘augur’ is an old word for seer and meant ‘increaser’. The great abundance of the Earth Mother is reflected in the titles she was given at this time: The Grain Mother, Barley Mother, Corn Mother, Demeter, Ceres, Cerealia, Grain, the Wise One of the Earth, the Increaser, She who is the seed, who is the womb, who is the soil, the Great Provider, the Preserver of Life. Cutting the ‘corn’ seems to be a general term for all cereal crops, whether they are wheat, barley, rye or oats. There were many customs and rituals throughout Europe to honour the first and the last sheaf of corn to be cut. The last sheaf was often cut by the youngest girl present and fashioned into a Corn Maiden. It was carried joyfully back to the village, sometimes plaited and decked with ribbons, and usually hung over the fireplace. Sometimes it was dressed in women’s clothes, and ritually burnt on the Lammas Fire. Sometimes these Corn Maidens were kept until Yule when they were divided up amongst the cattle or kept until the spring. Sometimes they were kept with the date tied to them. Many Corn Maidens would be seen hanging above the fireplace. In Scotland the ‘young maid’ was made out of the last stalks cut, and kept. The ‘old wife’ was made out of the first stalks cut and was passed on to the nearest farm that had not finished bringing in the corn. This was then passed round until it ended up at the last farm to be cut. Another old European custom was to weave the last sheaf into a large Corn Mother with a smaller corn doll inside it, representing next year’s unborn harvest. The regenerative power of the Earth is never more manifest than now as the grain harvest is gathered in and the Sun’s cycle begins to wane. The Cauldron of Regeneration was central to Celtic spiritual understanding. We are renewed by sleep and darkness, through many deaths and rebirths, and by the sacrifice of our outer lives for the inner journey. Here at Lammas, the doorway to the inner realms is opening. This is the symbolism behind the Demeter/Kore/Persephone story. Demeter, the Corn Mother, represents the ripe corn of this year’s harvest, and Kore or Persephone represents the grain-seed who lives in the dark throughout the winter and reappears in the Spring. Persephone’s descent into the Underworld is a mythical interpretation of the seed lying in the ground during the dark winter months, and her reappearance as the young maid, or the new sprouting seed, in the spring. This story shows us the Triple Goddess in all her aspects: as Earth Mother, the abundant provider; as the Crone, the wisdom found within; and as the Maiden who returns renewed in the spring. Pluto/Hades’ abduction of Persephone is a later reworking of this older myth. After all the manifest energy and activity of the early summer, it is good to make time now to rest and to assimilate all that has happened during the Sun’s active phase. Lammas celebrations would probably have begun with the cutting of the last sheaf of corn. Although the 2nd of August is the calendar date for Lammas, the great Lammas fairs and feasts would probably have lasted from mid July to mid August and would have peaked around the time of the harvest Full Moon. Once the grain had been safely gathered in and the men returned from their hunting trips, it was a time for feasting, dancing and merry-making, a great celebration of the first of the harvest and assessment of the year’s achievements. Beer, wine, cider and whisky made from the previous year’s harvest, were ritually drunk, celebrating the transformative power of Fire and Water. Cooking fires were honoured as they too embodied the power of Fire and Water. Bread was made from the new grain and thanks were given to the Sun’s life energy reborn as the bread of life. This is a busy time for harvesting herbs and collecting herb seeds to sow in the spring. Give thanks and blessings as you pick them, dry them and store them. Review what you know about them and ways you can use them both physically and metaphysically. Harvest sage at the end of July, before the flowers have come out. Sage is a herb associated with wisdom and releasing blocks in expression. It is connected to the throat chakra and is for those who have something to say but cannot let it out. It will help you express your emotions. Make the herb tea in the usual way. The infusion is a useful antiseptic herb for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers and mouth infections. It can be used as a gargle, for bathing wounds, sores, and to stop bleeding. Use the tea infusion externally and then drink afterwards as well. It will dry up excess secretions such as catarrh or sinusitis. It contains oestrogen and is useful in the menopause and for delayed menstruation. Burn dried sage to cleanse and purify. Waft the smoke around a person to cleanse their aura (called smudging). This is a good way to begin any ritual or ceremony. N.B. It must not be taken if pregnant, and because of its drying action, it must not be taken for long periods of time. It will dry up mother’s milk. Care must be taken by those who are insulin-dependent, and to be avoided by epileptics. Garlands of meadowsweet were traditionally worn for the Lammas celebrations. Its heady perfume expands the psyche, and builds inner strength. It enhances flexibility and connection to the inner levels. It is a mild sedative and painkiller containing salicylic acid (aspirin) that affects the rate at which blood clots. It is a good digestive tonic that reduces excess acidity and is useful for heartburn, hyperacidity, gastritis and peptic ulcers. As it cleanses the body of harmful acids, it is useful for any inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is a strong diuretic (increases urine) and can be used for any bladder or kidney complaint including cystitis. It reduces stagnation in the liver and therefore will help the immune system function more effectively. Its harvest time is July and August when the flowers are just beginning to open. Collect them in brown paper bags to dry for later use. N.B. Avoid if on anti-coagulant drugs. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Sacred Earth Celebrations, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"There are various methods for drying herbs for herbal recipes but they all require that the herb is dried and stored out of the light. I prefer to use brown paper bags, other people hang them up in bunches or lay them between sheets of newspaper or brown paper. • If using brown paper bags always label the bags with the name of the herb, the date and where you picked it. This is good practice and a good habit to get into as plants can change a lot in the drying process. Even if you think you will know what it is, it is surprising how you can forget, especially if you bag up several herbs over a period of a few weeks. • Leave the bags in a dry warm environment for several weeks. Put them in the airing cupboard if you have one, hang over the wood-burner or leave them on top of radiators. Shake the bags and turn the leaves over with your hands every day or two. It is essential to do this to stop any mould getting in to the herbs while they are still drying. • The herbal properties of leaves and flowers will deteriorate after 1 year so they need to be re-collected every year. Fruit, seeds, berries, roots and bark will last for 2 years. It is light that destroys the herbal properties of herbs, so at its simplest herbs can be stored all year in brown paper bags, although if they are kept in the kitchen they will need to be kept in a plastic container or airtight tin to keep them dry. Keeping the herbs in a dedicated leather or cotton bag is the traditional medicine way and these are hung somewhere warm and dry, near a radiator or fire. Putting them into dark glass jars is good in a kitchen because of the condensation. Clear jam jars are fine if they are kept in a dark cupboard. At its simplest the jar can be kept in a brown paper bag or more creative ways can be found. Herb teas vary in taste and quality. Buying popular blends as tea bags is convenient, but be aware that the herbs may be old by the time you drink them, and the herbs may have been grown in monocultures and sprayed with petrochemicals. It is infinitely better to make your own. • Making herb teas is not an exact science, especially when using the common safe plants. Interestingly, different herbalists use different amounts. I use about a teaspoonful of dried herbs or a small pile that fits into the hollow of my palm, and between a half to a pint of water, depending on the need. Use less for young children and anyone who is weak and frail. Dried herbs have twice the strength of fresh herbs, so twice the amount of fresh herb is used. • As you make the tea, say thank you to the plant. This open-hearted attitude adds to the healing process. I like to picture the plant and affirm its healing qualities as I wait for the tea to brew, partly to affirm the healing I am engaged in and also as a memory aid. This way I keep learning and understanding more about the plants all the time and keep my knowledge strong. Many of the herbs are an acquired taste. Nurture an openness to these wild flavours and earthy tastes and give them a chance. More often than not, a taste you didn’t like at first becomes a taste that you find you love. These are also for adults only as they are a mixture of brandy and honey. This makes them a most delicious way to take your medicine! They are especially good to use when travelling as they are kept in small dropper bottles and taken neat. Elixirs are combination remedies, created for specific uses and personal needs. Elixirs need to taste good so the addition of any aromatic herbs improves the flavour, but must also support the over-all herbal action. They are experimental and fun, as well as being extremely effective and I like to give them creative names. Write up everything in your Herb Journal. This is especially important when you make combination elixirs. Recording the plants and proportions used is invaluable when you create something you want to repeat. Method one 1. Half fill a dark jar with a herb or combinations of herbs: tear the leaves, crush the seeds or fruit, and chop the roots. Send your thanks to the plants. Add a little of something that will give it a nice flavour such as rose petals, sweet violet, lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena etc, making sure that their actions support the overall use of the remedy. 2. Cover the plant matter with clear runny honey and send your silent thanks to the bees. Poke well with a chopstick to get out any trapped air bubbles and break the plant matter up further. 3. Then top the jar up with brandy and 4. Put on the lid and label, date and shake well. Give it a poke and a shake frequently and keep out of bright light. They are ready in about a month, although they come to no harm if they are left longer. 5. Strain off the plant matter and rebottle in clean dark dropper bottles.

"Growing my own mulch has long been a goal of mine. We use a lot of mulch in the nursery and garden and at the moment I have no problem sourcing straw but if/when the day comes that the farmers start using their own straw to improve their soil (which is becoming a more common practice), I’ll be needing to step up my mulch growing efforts. Currently, I grow enough mulch to sustain my perennial beds and around 10% of my annual beds but rely on imported straw for mulching the other 90% of annual vegetable and nursery beds. My ideal mulch plant grows fast, is drought tolerant, competes minimally with crop plants, does not contain seed that easily spreads, is easy to handle and cut, i.e. not thorny/prickly or tough and fibrous, and can biodegrade relatively quickly (thereby returning the nutrients back to soil). I’ve broadly categorized the main sources of mulch we produce in our 1500m2 garden. Aquatic plants
I grow emergent wetland species such us cattails (Typha spp), sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) on the banks of a small pond (6m x 3m), and within a grey water reed bed (1m x 6m). The pond also provides suitable habitat for hornworts (Ceratophyllum spp). a submerged rootless perennial that gathers on the surface en masse. This plant makes an excellent mulch being rich in nitrogen, growing very fast and is easy to position around the base of plants. The emergent species provide a good thick carbon rich mulch that helps to reduce evaporation on the terrestrial beds and I cut these back in the spring in case they are used for overwintering invertebrates. Aquatic plants are an excellent source of mulch as there are no issues with seed germinating amongst your land based crops. Tap rooted perennial / biennials
Deep rooted perennial plants tend to produce a good amount of biomass, are generally drought tolerant and do not compete strongly with our crop plants. I have found native biennial weeds such as greater burdock (Arctium lappa), a very useful mulch plant with the gigantic leaves growing back very fast after a cut. Lesser burdock (Arctium minus), is also useful albeit to lesser extent. Although biennial, if you cut back these plants before flowering you can prolong their life, harvesting good quantities of seed free biomass. I do eventually allow some of the plants to flower and they are much loved by bees among other insects. Comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum), ‘bocking 14’, is a classic example of a deep rooted mulch plant. We have the plant scattered throughout the garden and planted in dedicated patches. The plants do require irrigation however and will only provide good leaf yields if grown on fertile soil. Peeing on the plants is recommended. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), provide a great source of biomass. For a good tuber harvest it’s best to wait until the end of the season before harvesting the mulch. We can never consume as much as we produce of these tubers in the kitchen. I have found them to be much appreciated by our pigs and an excellent source of fresh winter food for our rabbits. Leaves of greater burdock (Arctium lappa) Nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs 
These plants take a while to establish but make an excellent contribution. I’ve had good results from coppicing empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), when they are 3-years-old and chop and dropping the soft new growth three or four times a year. I am expecting to also see good results from grey alder (Alnus incana) and Italian alder (Alnus cordata). I avoid using thorny nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs for this purpose. Annual trimming of shrubs such as autumn olive – Elaeagnus umbellata and broom – Cytisus scoparius also provides good quantities of mulch. Click here for more info on nitrogen fixing plants. Lawn and ground cover
One of my favourite sources of mulch is lawn trimmings. They are great for mulching potted plants or applying a mulch into tight spots. Mixed species lawns will contain a more diverse mix of mineral nutrients. Lawns including a legume such as white clover (Trifolim repens), can provide a nitrogen rich mulch. It’s a good idea to leave some of the trimmings behind to keep the lawn healthy. Autumn leaf fall and herbaceous stem residue
The annual shedding of leaves from trees and shrubs in our garden make a great contribution to our mulch capital. Leaves can be cleared from paths, lawns and wildflower beds (as they will disrupt the growth in these areas) and concentrated where they are of benefit such as the base of high demanding fruiting shrubs such as blackcurrants or blackberries. Herbaceous perennials such as lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis) and mints (Mentha spp). will provide dead stems annually. It’s always a good idea to leave hollow stems of some herbaceous perennials to remain for the winter as they are utilized by invertebrates for egg laying and hibernating. If the plant does not have a hollow stem it can be cut back and used for mulch. Fennel (Foeniculm vulgare), provides large quantities of biomass and as far as I can tell the stems are not utilised by any organism over the winter. In the vegetable garden all the remnants of my crops after harvesting go straight back to the surface for recycling. Foeniculum vulgare and other herbaceous perennials Tree prunings
Woody prunings from shrubs, trees and vines cut into small pieces (5-10cm) make good mulch in the mature areas of the forest garden with well established fungal soils specializing in breaking down the lignified woody material. Living mulches 
In the more mature areas of the garden where the trees have established (5yrs and older) I have dispensed with mulch all together in favour of ground cover plants that can be considered living mulches. Some the most successful perennial living mulches I have found that form good dense cover in the shade include bugle (Ajuga reptans), spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), Caucasian stonecrop (Sedem spurium), perwinkle (Vinca major) and betony (Stachys officinalis). Lamium maculatum spreading well under a mullbery (Morus alba) Scaling up mulch production
In order to grow enough mulch to provide a water retaining, weed excluding barrier for my annual and nursery beds I would certainly need more space. A larger wetland area would be ideal, with aquatic species growing very fast and the seed bearing parts of the plants being non problematic to use on terrestrial beds. If you don’t have a reliable aquatic habitat, the next best option for growing quantities of mulch without irrigation and fertilization is probably grass. During my next post I’ll be sharing a plan where using the lessons garnered from small scale systems, we’ll be growing mulch to support approx 670 fruit trees and 1360 soft fruit shrubs on a 5ha Agroforestry Project (design layout below).

"There are many medicinal uses for elder – Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae family). It is an evocative tree, steeped in history, tradition, and folklore. This is one of our great food and medicinal plants, easily found in most areas of the British Isles where people have settled. It’s botanical name, Sambucus nigra, stems from the Greek word sambuke; a ‘musical pipe’, due to its hollow form supplying our ancestors a perfect wood for making pipes. The Latin ‘nigra’, means black, in allusion to the dark colour of ripe elder berry fruit. Elder is a deciduous woodland and hedgerow plant, native to Northern Europe and North America, and can be seen happily growing on most types of soil up to altitudes of approximately 470m. Superstition says to not cut elder down or burn them. This may be purely because of the toxic fumes which rise from burning elder wood, or it may be that the faeries will be really upset because you are destroying such a useful plant! Other legends have grown around this plant, such as that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who allegedly betrayed Jesus to the Romans, then said to have hanged himself from its branches. This story gave rise to the name of the edible fungus found all year round on the elder – the Jelly Ear. Elder can sometimes be found growing as a shrubby form, and sometimes like a tree on a single trunk, similar to other woodland-edge plants like hazel, hawthorn and blackthorn. A mature elder typically displays a domed crown, and will be spotted from a distance once you know it. Elders can reach 8m or more, although more commonly 5-6m or so, because of other limiting environmental factors. Ideally the plant likes a rich and damp soil in a sunny position. Elder does not like exposed sites or windy hillsides. The branches display numerous lenticels (air holes) and produce their stems with opposite pairs of buds. The buds are naked, without bud scales. The light brown, corky bark pattern on elder can appear quite similar to the invasive exotic, the ‘butterfly bush’ – Buddleja davidii. The similarity between Sambucus and Buddleja ends there. Elder’s leaves are completely different in form. They are compound, comprising of seven oval, serrated leaflets, each being about 7-10cm long. The leaflets typically come in two or three opposite pairs with one terminal leaflet. They are a much lighter green colour than the Himalayan native ‘butterfly bush’ which has a simple, lanceolate / elliptical leaf. You will find this year’s flowers and fruits on last year’s growth. The umbel-like elderflowers, (technically corymbs), are borne on terminal stems. Five creamy-white petals surround the yellow anthers. When ripe, and picked on a sunny day, are bursting with pollen and scent, and should be a bright lemon-yellow. They turn brown when past their best. Only pick ripe flowers! The flowers have a small amount of natural yeast on them which assists fermentation when making drinks. This will be testified by anyone who makes the superb thirst quenching elderflower champagne! The rank smell of elder leaves or the gone-over flowers is known to repel many who come across it, often being described as a cat urine smell!  After a short but sweet period in full bloom, the flowers give rise to upstanding clusters of small berries, which are typically no bigger than 10mm in diameter. Initially green, the berries gradually begin to nod earthwards as they ripen. At the end of the summer they are dark purple – with many medicinal uses. Parts used Flowers, berries, leaves, bark, fungi. Harvest time The flowers are picked when in full bloom. The berries are picked when ripe in the autumn. Key active medicinal constituents Tannins, potassium, mucilage, phenols, triterpenes, sterols, lectins, flavonoids (including rutin). The dark coloured berries are rich in anthocyanins, folic acid and vitamins A and C. They also contain flavonoids, and cyanidin glucosides, which are poisonous in large doses.  Medicinal actions Diaphoretic, febrifuge, anti-catarrhal, anti viral, immuno-supportive. Uses – Elderflowers and berries are expectorant and diaphoretic, thus they help to manage and reduce fevers and to rid the body of toxins. – Elderflowers are also anti-viral and are useful in combating herpes simplex type 1 virus (responsible for cold sores). – The flowers can be made into champagne, cordials, wine, sorbet, jam and fritters. – Elderberry extract has been proven to inhibit various strains of flu, especially if taken early enough. Many people can testify that elder can significantly reduce recovery times from influenza. – Some books have stated the ripe berries are poisonous, but this is slightly misleading. They will cause gastric upset if you eat a large quantity raw, (as will too many apples while scrumping) but in small amounts they should present no problem. Cooked into jams, syrups etc., larger quantities of elderberries are absolutely fine. – Pioneering contemporary forager-chefs have rediscovered that even the green berries can be used, as ‘capers’, if prepared correctly. This involves fermenting the berries in a salt brine solution for a few days, similar to preparing green walnuts for pickling, and then covering in a flavoured vinegar. – Even when the tree is dormant in the winter, it is still possible to harvest food! The ‘Jelly ear’ fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is often found on elder, dead or alive. Known as a delicacy in China, it is best cooked sliced into thin strips, in a spicy, oriental-style soup.

"There’s a plethora of info out there about comfrey but not much detail regarding establishing and managing a comfrey patch so I thought I would write an article to share my experience on this and how we grow comfrey as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden. A member of the borage family, comfrey – Symphytum spp. is native to Europe and Asia and there are 40 recorded species throughout that region. The plant most commonly referred to and used in gardens is Russian comfrey – Symphytum x uplandicum, a naturally occurring hybrid of two wild species: common comfrey – Symphytum officinale and prickly comfrey – Symphytum asperum. A few centuries back, the hybrid Symphytum x uplandicum came to the attention of Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) and he widely promoted the plant as a food and forage crop. Years later, and after two world wars, Lawrence D Hills (1911-1991) would continue Henry Doubleday’s Comfrey crusade. In the 1950s, Hills developed a comfrey research program in the village of Bocking, near Braintree in the UK. The original trial site is on the plot of land now occupied by the Doubleday Gardens housing development. Lawrence Hills lived at 20 Convent Lane just around the corner of the trial site. At this site, Hills trialed at least 21 comfrey ‘strains’, each one named after the village Bocking. Strain 14 was identified as being the most nutrient rich, non-seeding strain and ‘Bocking 14’ began its journey into gardens far and wide across the world. (Learn more its history on the Balkan Ecology Project blog.) Medicinal – Comfrey has been cultivated as a healing herb since at least 400BC. The Greeks and Romans commonly used comfrey to stop heavy bleeding, treat bronchial problems and heal wounds and broken bones. Poultices were made for external wounds and tea was consumed for internal ailments. Comfrey has been reported to promote healthy skin with its mucilage content that moisturizes and soothes and promotes cell proliferation. This plant is my first port of call if ever I need to dress a wound. Simply take a few leaves brush them together to remove the hairs and wrap them around the wound and apply light pressure. It’s incredibly effective at stopping the bleeding, reducing the pain and healing the wound. Biomas – Comfrey produces large amounts of foliage from late May (late spring) until hard frosts in October or November (late autumn). The plant is excellent for producing mulch and can be cut from 2-5 times per year depending on how well the plants are watered and fed. The plant grows rapidly after each harvest. In our gardens we have Comfrey ‘Bocking 14’ located next to each fruit tree in order to have a renewable source of mulch just where we need it. We also grow in patches as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden and have patches in the wildflower meadows (details below). We’ve supplied 1,000 ‘Bocking 14’ cuttings to Oxygenisis, a business in Germany who are experimenting with using this plant for carbon capture. Mineral dam – Comfrey has deep roots of up to 2m that utilize nutrients deep in the subsoil that would otherwise wash away with the underground soil water or remain inaccessible to other plants. The nutrients, once taken up from the roots, are relocated throughout the plant as and where needed with some of them ending up in the comfrey leaf mass. When cutting the leaf mass and applying to the soil surface, the mined nutrients are returned and again made accessible to shallower rooted crop plants.  Biodiversity – The bell shaped flowers provide nectar and pollen to many species of bees and other insects from late May until the first frosts in late autumn. Lacewings are said to lay eggs on comfrey and spiders overwinter on the plant. Parasitoid wasps and spiders will hunt on and around comfrey. Pest and disease prevention and control – Research indicates that a comfrey solution can be used to prevent powdery mildew. Pest predators such as spiders, lacewings and parasatoid wasps associate with this plant. It’s best to leave some plants alone in order to sustain pest predator relationships. Ground cover – Some species can quickly spread to form a thick ground cover and work particularly well for ground cover on the sunny side under shrubs and trees. Symphytum tuberosum – Tuberous Comfrey seems to be the best species for this.  Fertilizer – Comfrey leaves contain a great balance of major plant nutrients (N,P,K) and can be fed to plants as powder, direct mulch or by steeping chopped comfrey leaves in water for several weeks to produce a thick, dark liquid that can be diluted with water and applied to plant roots. More on this below. Nutritional value of comfrey – You can see from the below table that wilted comfrey contains significantly higher quantities of potash compared to other organic fertilizers. It’s well recorded that comfrey is an excellent source of potassium (K) a major plant nutrient that is required by plants in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction. Animal fodder – Comfrey has a long history for use as an animal feed. Lawrence D Hills dedicated books to this topic.* The leaves are best received by animals wilted. Fresh leaves can be eaten by pigs, sheep, and poultry but cattle, rabbits and horses will only consume wilted leaves. Human consumption – Symphytum officianale and Symphytum x uplandicum are both reported to be used for salad and potherb and are best when cooked. Personally I’m not keen on the texture but will have the occasional nibble from the garden using the new growth to mix in a spring green salad. Caution – Although comfrey has been used as a food crop, in the past 20 years scientific studies reported that comfrey may be carcinogenic, since it appeared to cause liver damage and cancerous tumors in rats. These reports have temporarily restricted development of comfrey as a food crop. In light of this, the regular consumption of comfrey is not advisable.  Life cycle – Herbaceous perennial Growth habit – Comfrey begins growth in early-April and by early May compact clusters of young leaves are visible in the crown of the old plant. Within a few weeks, the leaf blades with long petioles have grown to over 35cm high. Basal leaves are large, lance-shaped, stalked, and coarsely hairy. The leaves die back following the first frost and remain dormant for winter. Many species can spread vigorously via seed and are generally not welcome in the garden because of this. Other species can spread via tubers and all species quickly regenerate from broken root pieces.  Flowering – Starts in late May or early June and continues until the first frost in late autumn. The bell-shaped flowers with pedicels are in terminal cymes or one-sided clusters. Flowers of common comfrey are usually creamy yellow, but white, red, or purple types have been found in Europe. Prickly comfrey has pink and blue flowers while Russian comfrey has blue, purple, or red-purple flowers. Tuberous comfrey has creamy white flowers. Vegetative growth does not cease with the start of flowering, and the plant will add new stems continuously during the growing season. Most comfrey plants can be somewhat invasive, spreading via seed to parts of the garden where they are not wanted. ‘Bocking 14’ will flower and provide nectar and pollen but will not produce viable seed. Roots – Some species have short, thick, tuberous roots such as Symphytum tuberosum. Others such as Symphytum x uplandicum have deep and expansive root systems. Light – Needs full sun for good biomass production but grows fine in the shade. Shade – Tolerates light shade (about 50%). Moisture – Some species are drought tolerant e.g. Symphytum tuberosum. Cultivated plants require irrigation. USDA Hardiness Zone – 4-9 comfrey crowns and roots are very winter hardy.  Soil – Comfrey is adaptable to many soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils.  pH – Tolerates a wide range (6.5-8.5), although not very sensitive to soil pH, highest yields are reported to occur on soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Perhaps you’re interested in growing comfrey to feed your animals, for medicine, for mulch, for compost or you’re slightly masochistic and want to roll around naked in the pricky beds of biomass (not me). In any case, here’s how to do it. The plant we use in our gardens is Symphytum x uplandicum – ‘Bocking 14’. A sterile cultivar that produces copious quantities of nutrient dense biomass. The following information is based on using this plant.  Choosing the site – We’re growing for biomass and want the plants to receive as much light as possible. Accordingly, we lay out our beds on an east to west axis (we’re in the northern hemisphere).  Irrigation is necessary if you want to get good yields from the plants so picking a place with access to irrigation is of paramount important.  In areas of low rainfall, using the gradient of the land to channel precipitation towards your beds will reduce the water needs of your plants. In areas of high rainfall with a high water table you should consider diverting water away from the beds. Once established, comfrey is difficult to get rid of, so choose a site where you want it to stay. Don’t plant comfrey in any area you cultivate, as the broken root pieces quickly establish into new plants and can out compete slower growing crops.  Position comfrey downhill from where you expect leachate to be present, i.e downhill from a manure pile , compost heap, outside toilet, animal pen etc., can provide passive fertility to the plants and rescue otherwise lost minerals from draining away with the sub soil ground water. 
Grow the comfrey where you want to use it. As you’ll see later we may be harvesting over 1/4 ton biomass from our patch and don’t want to be carrying that over long distances. Preparing the site – Raised beds are a major part of our fertility strategy and overtime retain water and nutrients very efficiently. I use 1.3m wide beds surrounded by 50cm paths for our crops as this allows easy access for harvesting everywhere in the beds without ever having to tread on the soil and the paths are wise enough to take our lawnmower. To form a bed, the area should be cleared of all plants, which is best achieved by sheet mulching the season before. Pernicious perennials or tap rooted biennials should be dug out. After you have cleared the whole area, mark out the bed shape with string and dig out 50cm wide paths around your beds, applying the soil to the surface of the planting area and thereby creating the initial rise of the bed. Fork over the beds well. If a hardpan is present take the time and effort to eliminate it before planting. Depending on the quality of your soil you may want to add extra compost before planting into the bed. If you have sheet mulched the area before hand, with the additional soil from the paths all you need to do is add a good 20cm thick straw mulch (or some other mulch) and it’s ready for planting. A good mulch to start with will help keep the weeds down while your comfrey gets going. You can alter the depth and gradient of the paths to facilitate the required direction of water movement. Planting material – You can plant out with crown divisions or root cuttings best done in the spring when the soil has warmed. A crown division can be obtained from simply putting a spade through the center of a mature comfrey plant and transplanting the divided sections. For our beds, I divided two year old plants into quarters, sometimes sixths, and these established very well in the first year. It’s bests not to harvest the leaf biomass in the first year in order to allow a deep root system to develop. However if you use large divisions you can start harvesting in July. Root cuttings are a great way to plant out large areas of comfrey. The cuttings should be grown on in small pots with 50% compost 50% river sand mix kept moist and planted out in the spring as soon as the first leaves emerge and the soil has warmed. If you are planting large numbers of root cuttings you can plant directly into the beds by creating ‘nests’ in the straw, adding two cupped handfuls of the above mentioned potting mix and plant the cuttings into this. Keep them moist like a wrung out sponge and the success rate will be very close to 100%. Spacing – The plants should be spaced 60cm apart in rows and 60cm apart at diagonals between rows. Plant the rows 15cm from the edge of the beds. Cutting – In the first year allow the plants to establish so that the roots develop well and penetrate deep into the subsoil. Remove any weeds around the plants leaving them on the surface. The following year the cutting can begin. You can scythe the beds for a quick harvest or cut each plant individually with a pair of secateurs or shears cutting to 5cm or so from ground level. The leaves are prickly so if you have sensitive hands wear gloves. Cut the comfrey as the flowering stalks emerge up to four times a year. Allow the plants to flower at least once during the season to provide bee fodder to a range of native bees and honey bees. Leave the last flush of leaves before the winter so that invertebrates can find winter shelter in the undergrowth. You may need to weed between cuts every now and then but generally the comfrey will quickly cover the surface. Feeding – After you have cut the comfrey, mow the pathways between the beds and empty the trimmings to the base of the comfrey plants. Any trimmings from lawns and hedges in the surrounding area can also be used. We are experimenting with growing nitrogen fixing hedging and ground cover plants adjacent to the patch in order to feed our comfrey. A most excellent comfrey feed is undiluted urine applied at a rate of approx 500 ml per plant twice per growing season. Irrigation – Comfrey will produce more biomass if irrigated and in dry climates it’s essential to irrigate. Comfrey plants wilt very fast in hot conditions and will stop photosynthesising at this point. Twenty litres per m2 per week of drought should be more than adequate. The beauty of biological systems are that, if managed properly, each year the soils improve and the ability of the soil to store water will improve over time. We use passive irrigation diverting water from a mountain stream into the paths around the beds. The paths fill with water, we raise the level by blocking the low points with sacks of sawdust and the water is drawn throughout the soil via capillary action. Passive irrigation in our market garden. The paths fill with water and the water permeates throughout the soil via capillary action. As mulch – Freshly cut comfrey leaves make good mulch because they have high nitrogen content, and don’t pull nitrogen from the soil while decomposing. Comfrey’s high potassium content makes it especially beneficial for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, berries, and fruit trees. With adequate feed and watering we’ve seen yields of 2-3kg of biomass per plant per cut. Comfrey beds establishing well. This bed was planted with divided crowns 5 months prior to this photo being taken. Liquid fertliser – What I like to call ‘Comfert’. Fill a barrel, preferably with a bottom tap and a gauze on the inside (to prevent clogging) about 3/4 full with freshly cut comfrey and add water to fill the barrel. Cover it, and let it steep for 3-6 weeks. The smell from the resulting liquid is far from attractive so approach with caution. The tea may be used full strength or diluted by half or more. Don’t apply before heavy rain is forecast as most of the nutrients suspended in the liquid will wash straight through the soil. For the best results apply the feed to your vegetables when they are in most need of the extra fertility. This will be different for each crop, for example, tomatoes are best fed when they are setting fruit and then any time during the fruiting period. Applying comfert before this can be counter productive and make your plants more susceptible to pest problems. The black slurry at the bottom of the barrel can be dispersed evenly back over the comfrey patch. Liquid fertilizer concentrate – ‘Comfert Plus’ can also be made by packing fresh-cut comfrey tops into an old bucket, weighing them down with something heavy, covering tightly, and waiting a few weeks for them to decompose into a black slurry. You can put a hole in the bottom of the bucket and collect the concentrate in another container as it drips out. Dilute this comfrey concentrate about 15 to 1 with water, and use as you would comfert. You can seal this concentrate in plastic jugs until you are ready to use it. Warning! Comfert stinks like hell. My nieces came to visit from London last year and offered to help out in the market garden. One of the tasks that day was to apply comfert to the crops. Let’s just say it did not end well and we had a much better experience taking softwood cuttings the next day. According to Martin Crawford in Creating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops, one cut of comfrey from one plant contains 0.5g of Nitrogen (N) and 10g of potassium (K) to crops. Based on this I calculated how much Potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and biomass the 13 m2 comfrey patch can potentially produce in a year. Below is a table indicating how many comfrey cuts are needed to meet the Nitrogen and Potassium needs of various moderate and heavy cropping fruit and nut trees and annual vegetables. In the 1960s, Lawrence D. Hills used UK gardeners records for a comfrey report. (See the Balkan Ecology Project blog for the results.) Based on these records I calculated a yield of approx. 5.5kg of biomass per plant each year. Using this figure one of our beds should produce approx 286kg of biomass. We shall see as this year we begin our own records. We’re looking to gather some solid data on how comfrey performs in our climate and we’ll be recording the yields from our patch starting this season and for at least the next five years. For more info on our record keeping and research programs see Polyculture Market Garden Study. If you would like to join the ‘who can grow the most comfrey’ experiment and contribute data to our records, send us an email. It will be great to have records from all over the world.

"Hugelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, means hill culture or hill mound. Instead of putting branches, leaves and grass clippings in bags by the curbside for the bin men… build a hugel bed. Simply mound logs, branches, leaves, grass clippings, straw, cardboard, petroleum-free newspaper, manure, compost or whatever other biomass you have available, top with soil and plant your veggies. The advantages of a hugel bed are many, including: The gradual decay of wood is a consistent source of long-term nutrients for the plants. A large bed might give out a constant supply of nutrients for 20 years (or even longer if you use only hardwoods). The composting wood also generates heat which should extend the growing season. Soil aeration increases as those branches and logs break down… meaning the bed will be no till, long term. The logs and branches act like a sponge. Rainwater is stored and then released during drier times. Actually you may never need to water your hugel bed again after the first year (except during long term droughts). Sequester carbon into the soil. On a sod lawn Sepp Holzer (hugelkultur expert) recommends cutting out the sod, digging a one foot deep trench and filling the trench with logs and branches. Then cover the logs with the upside down turf. On top of the turf add grass clippings, seaweed, compost, aged manure, straw, green leaves, mulch, etc…  Sepp Holzer recommends steep hugel beds to avoid compaction from increased pressure over time. Steep beds mean more surface area in your garden for plants and the height makes easy harvesting. The greater the mass, the greater the water-retention benefits. Hugel bed dug in clay with logs put in vertically, next branches and lots of wood chips. Top 6 inches will be wood chips and dirt. This bed will store water and give nutrients for many years to come. Straw bale gardens require less soil, less water and hold heat. As the straw breaks down nutrients feed the plants. Combining a straw surround with a hugel interior, topped by lasagne layering is an excellent idea for an area with poor quality soil. Hugel bed in Ontario, Canada (June 28th) by Tim Burrows. Tim surrounded his very tall hugel bed in pallets! Sheet mulching (lasagne gardening) is like composting in place. Above: just a suggestion as to sheet mulching layers. Nitrogen-rich material such as fresh grass clippings or green leaves put right on the hugelkultur wood would help jump start the composting process. Could also include seaweed, straw, dead leaves, leaf mould, etc.

The first year of break down means the wood (and fungi) steal a lot of the nitrogen out of the surrounding environment, so adding nitrogen during the first year or planting crops that add nitrogen to the soil (like legumes) or planting species with minimal nitrogen requirements is necessary, unless there is plenty of organic material on top of the wood. After the wood absorbs nitrogen to its fill, the wood will start to break down and start to give nitrogen back in the process. In the end you will be left with a beautiful bed of nutrient rich soil. Tree types that work well in hugelkultur:
Hardwoods break down slowly and therefore your hugel bed will last longer, hold water for more years and add nutrients for more years. But softwoods are acceptable as well, a softwood bed will just disintegrate quicker. Mixing woods with softwoods and branches on top, to give off nutrients first, and hardwoods on bottom, sounds like a plan if you have access to multiple types of wood. Yet the newly decomposing softwoods at the top will eat up a lot of nitrogen at first, so compensate for that.

Woods that work best:
Alders, apple, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, oak, poplar, willow (make sure it is dead or it will sprout).

Trees types that work okay:
Black cherry (use only rotted), camphor wood (well aged), cedar/juniper/yew (anti-microbial/anti-fungal, so use only at very bottom or unless already well-aged. Cedar should be broken down before new plant roots reach it), eucalyptus (slightly anti-microbial), osage orange (exceptionally resistant to decay), Pacific yew (exceptionally resistant to decay), pine/fir/spruce (tannins and sap), red mulberry (exceptionally resistant to decay).

Tree types to avoid:
Black locust (will not decompose), black walnut (juglone toxin), old growth redwood (heartwood will not decompose and redwood compost can prevent seed germination).

"Thistles are a bane of picnickers and campers. Who hasn’t trodden on the sharp, unforgiving spines of a thistle when out and about barefoot in grasslands? For many people, relationships with thistles have generally been painful and irritable, but now you can get your own back! One of the great things about thistles is that every single species is edible, so this is great news for foraging beginners! Even the closest lookalikes found here are edible – the sow thistles (Sonchus spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), so when working with the thistles, you can learn to identify and proceed to experiment with complete confidence from the outset. We have at least 14 species of thistle growing wild in the UK, mostly from the Cirsium (aka plume thistles) and Carduus genera. Thistles are found in numerous settings all over our islands and can be a useful soil barometer. Often their presence signifies that the land is fertile, and in many instances, neglected. I eat from a number of different species. These are: creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis), spear thistle (C. vulgare), woolly thistle (C. eriophorum), marsh thistle (C. palustris), and welted thistle (Carduus acanthoides syn C. crispus). As you will discover, plants that have spines to offer protection against predators, have no real need for bitterness. Spear thistle It’s almost impossible to misidentify a thistle. One of the easy-to-spot botanical differences between thistles and their numerous relatives in the daisy family, is that the overlapping bracts (involucre) found directly below the flowers of thistles, are always spiny. Simple! The leaves of the numerous species will differ in size, shape and the density of spine coverage. Most have stiff spines on the margins, but some have soft prickles. You need to discover for yourself which are the more tactile! When in flower, most thistles produce a lovely purple / mauve bloom, but some species are known for their yellow inflorescence (cabbage thistle – Cirsium oleraceum and the Carline thistle – Carlina vulgaris). In all of the thistles, flowers give way to copious amounts of fluffy hairs (pappus) attached to their tiny fruits, superbly designed for air-borne dispersal. A distinguishing feature between the two main generais that Cirsium spp. produce feathered pappus hairs, whereas Carduus spp. only have simple pappus hairs. Creeping thistle produces dense spines on its leaves, but very few spines or hairs on the flowering stems. Spear thistle has large, deeply-lobed leaves with large spines at the margins, as well as hairy, spiny stems. Marsh thistle looks somewhat like spear thistle at an initial glance, but without the large spines and leaf lobes, and usually with a thin, red, leaf margin. Woolly thistle is easily identifiable with large, deeply-lobed, evenly-shaped leaves, and very large flower heads, wrapped in a ‘cobweb’ of cotton-like hairs. This particular species is the largest wild thistle I use, although if you have milk thistle (Silybum marianum) growing in your plot, you can use that too, but you will need good gloves to protect yourself from its long spiny flower heads! Eating milk thistle chokes would of course prevent you harvesting the exceptional liver-supportive medicine found in the seeds. Wooly thistle Creeping thistle will grow in all manner of waste-ground, grasslands, verges and field edges. I also see a lot of spear thistle in similar habitats, although when found in grassland, it’s not as abundant as the creeping species. The root systems explain why; spear thistle has a tap root, whereas creeping thistle grows on rhizomes. The marsh thistle, as its name alludes to, likes damp conditions such as fens, marshes, canal tow-paths and riversides. Woolly thistle is a little bit more selective in its choice of soil and setting, preferring calcareous ground. It too enjoys grasslands. Welted thistle can be found all over the UK, especially loving clay soils. Go prepared! Stiff gloves and a knife are required. Harvest the best leaf mid-ribs in spring when growth is plentiful and quick. Your specimens will be tender and sweeter. Flowering stems will appear from late spring through into autumn. I only consider harvesting from plants whose flower buds are yet to really begin unfurling. Flower buds (chokes) are available all summer. In Portugal, a number of thistle species are still collected in spring and sold at markets. A recent academic study highlighted the nutritional value from eating thistles. The findings are contained within ‘Ethnobotany In The New Europe’ by Manuel. P de Santayana et al. (Eds), published June 2010. In the study, researchers noted the wide range of thistle species collected, and concentrated on the nutritional value of one particular thistle (Scolymus hispanicus – Spanish or golden thistle). This plant is collected by villagers in various areas of the countryside. Bunches of the stripped leaf mid-ribs are sold and bought in a number of markets in different areas. Levels of certain nutrients were analysed and compared to some commonly consumed vegetables. Their findings show that the thistle contained consistently higher levels of important major nutrients than some of our commonly consumed cultivated vegetables. Weight for weight, thistles come out higher in fibre, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc and other nutrients. Is it likely that the thistles found wild here will be similarly endowed with a range of important vitamins and minerals? I’m more than happy to work on the assumption that this will be the case. Many other wild plant species are known to contain high concentrations of important nutrients. Preparing thistles is pretty easy. Simply choose the most tender specimens. If using the petioles, then cut and strip all the spines off, before peeling the outer, fibrous layer from the stalk. Use raw as crudités, pickle or ferment them, or chop into salads and serve them with a tangy vinaigrette. If cooking, they don’t require long! Preparing the stems is similar, but they are hollow. These can be used in similar ways to the petioles, or you can stuff them, roast them, and braise them. As relatives of the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), thistles produce edible, if smaller, ‘chokes’. These are the crunchy, immature bases, or capitulum, of the composite flower-head. As you would do with globe artichokes, peel away the bracts to get to the prize. I only choose the largest wild species for this. Happy foraging!

"Some plants seem to be our constant companions, no matter where we live. Often, they will also be some of our really useful species. It will soon become clear that the common mallow (Malva sylvestris) is one of these plants. Rather than being looked upon as a weed, the mallows can be more usefully described as some of our gloriously abundant plant helpers. A number of mallow species have long been used as a food and medicine, wherever they are found native, and especially in the Middle East and Asia. You won’t have far to go to find the common mallow in most parts of Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia either. Common mallow can be found growing erect or prostrate, which may initially cause confusion because it’s easy to assume they might be two different species. Mallow’s kidney-shaped or palmately-lobed leaves are notably creased, typically with dentate margins. The leaves often show a purple spot in the centre of the base of the leaf and this can also be seen to run down the petiole on some specimens. On other specimens, the purple spotting and colouring is completely absent. Mallow leaves have long petioles. Their deep green foliage hints at a renowned drought tolerance. During flowering, the leaves appear alternately on the stems. Holding a leaf relays the surface coarseness. But tear and crush one, and you discover a family pattern – the mucilage. You will soon experience a slimy and tacky feel between your fingers. All parts of the plant contain mucilage. In bloom, the Malvaceae family plants produce five large notched petals in each open flower. Common mallow has showy pink petals laced with darker-coloured strokes. In the centre of the flower lies a pollen-loaded column of fused stamens. This surrounds the stigma, which rises above the column.  Mallow is known to freely seed. The round seed pods, known as ‘cheeses’, soon follow flowering. These were once munched by children on their way to and from school. The pods are held on stalks, close to the flowering stem. Mallow will be found on most soils, from coastal to marginally upland habitats, with most settings being adequate for this resilient plant. It loves waste-ground as well as grassland; gravel as much as coastal edges, and waysides and roadsides as well as hedges.  Leaves, flowers, seed pods, roots. Leaves, in spring; flowers from late spring; seed pods from early summer. Roots could be harvested from larger rosettes whenever large enough. Medicinal and nutritional constituents Vitamins A,B,C,E; inulin; mucilage; phenols; flavonoids; essential fatty acids; fibre; calcium; magnesium; zinc; selenium; potassium. Traditional and contemporary uses As with many wild food plants, the common mallow has also had a long history of medicinal use. Due to its high mucilage content, mallows make excellent soothing demulcent herbs, especially for cases of inflammation, either for the urinary, digestive or respiratory systems. Pregnant women or new mothers may like to know that mallow leaves can provide useful amounts of iron, as well as being quite high in zinc and most vitamins.  All of the mallow family with exception to the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum), are reportedly edible. With their high mucilage content, the leaves can usefully be taken as an emergency antidote to irritation or burning that may be caused by the accidental consumption of acrid plants in the buttercup family. Creative cooks can substitute mallow for spinach in many dishes, including soups, salads, gnocchi and quiche. I have even flash-fried larger mallow leaves for just one second in hot oil to make ‘popadoms’. Mallow also makes a great addition to soups, whereby the mucilage helps to thicken them.  In Jewish culture, mallow has been been considered the ‘most important plant in local gather society’. Every spring mallow is gathered in the countryside. Its common name in both Hebrew and Arabic, translates to ‘bread’.  During the war of 1948, when Jerusalem was under siege, mallow was an important famine crop, and one that is still celebrated on Independence day every year with a traditional dish made from mallow leaves. Common mallow can be substituted for the family relative Corchorus olitorius aka ‘jutes mallow’, when making the Egyptian / Middle-Eastern dish ‘Molokhia’. This traditional dish is usually served with chicken.  In China, mallow roots are a popular and a common ingredient in making hearty, yet medicinally potent soups and broths. The inulin-rich tap roots of a number of different mallow species, including common mallow, have been used. The seed pods can be substituted for most of the egg white if wanting to make mallow meringues. Simply boil up the peeled seed pods using 3 parts water 1 part seed pods, and reduce the liquid by half. For every half cup of liquid add one egg white, ¼ tsp of cream of tartar, some vanilla and castor sugar, then whip it up until foamy and stiff, just like meringues.  21st Century Foraging  The Medicinal Forest Garden  The Fast Wild Food Cookbookby Johnny Jumbalaya  Amazing Moringa: Medicinal, Edible & Easy to Grow  How to Make your own Sloe Gin Chris Hope, aka Chris Phyto, was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic plant lover, forager and teacher, who sadly died in 2021.";Permaculture Magazine UK

Olive oil
800g (28 oz/5 ⅓ cup) tomatoes, chopped
Plus 2 or 3 tomatoes, sliced, to decorate
240g (8.5 oz/1.5 cups) cooked beans
(400g tin, drained)
1-2 tbsp chopped herbs – basil, parsley or oregano (or a mixture of all three)
Salt and pepper to taste For the garlic bread
A crusty loaf of bread 
4-10 cloves garlic (I like it strong!)
0.5-1 cup olive oil (it depends how large the loaf is)
Pepper
An oven dish approximately 25 x 25cm (10 x 10in) Preheat the oven to 180oC fan (200oC/400oF/gas mark 6). Finely chop the garlic and mix into the olive oil. Add a little pepper, stir and leave to infuse. Slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways into 5mm thick slices. Pour some olive oil into the pan and soften the onions, garlic and celery on a low heat.  When cooked, add the red pepper, beans and tomatoes. Simmer for around 15 minutes until the sauce is cooked through. Meanwhile, drizzle olive oil onto a griddle and cook the aubergines and courgettes, several slices at a time, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Pour some of the tomato sauce into the oven dish, add a layer of aubergine, then more sauce, a layer of courgette, and so on until the dish is filled with layers of sauce, aubergine and courgette. Decorate with slices of tomato. Put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Slice the bread so the knife goes about 90% through the loaf, leaving the base intact and the slices attached to each other. Put in a baking dish and, using a spoon, drizzle the garlic oil over both sides of each slice.  15 minutes before the lasagne is ready, put the bread in the oven. When the lasagne is cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the crusty garlic bread and a large salad, or dish of steamed seasonal green vegetables. Tip – Frying pan will work if you don’t have a griddle. This recipe adapts well to other vegetables. In the winter, use slices of cooked potato, parsnip, sweet potato or squash.

"My name is Suzanne Pendleton and I live in Swinton, Salford (UK) and have been involved in the Greater Manchester Swift Street initiative since August 2024, which has been led by the RSPB. During lockdown I started to value my time outside as so many families did too. I enjoyed time in our little garden more and spotted some birds as they zoomed and screamed over the house. I wasn’t quite sure what they were and asked my friend Kathleen who lived on a surrounding road what they might be. She enlightened me. They were Swifts, a species recently added to the UK’s Red List of birds, meaning they are now amongst our most threatened. Then the summer was over and the swifts left Swinton heading back to Africa.  Each year since, I have eagerly anticipated the return of the Swifts. My understanding grew and I learnt of their declining numbers, now less than 60,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Along with developing a stiff neck constantly looking up to the sky, watching their incredible aerial manoeuvres.  I am privileged to live in a friendly neighbourhood on our lane. The community are always up for helping, and we pull together to help each other. We have a community messaging service which came into its own in lockdown, and continues to be a fabulous way to share information and request help and advice. During the last few years I had messaged our community group and asked if anyone knew about our Swifts and where they were nesting. Initially we were unsuccessful in understanding, but in spring 2024 we struck lucky and finally worked out the eaves where they lived. I’d also discovered Swift Mapper (an app for recording the location of Swift nesting sites) enabling us to understand we had four nest sites on the Lane and surrounding roads.  We also realised that there was another small colony locally less that 1/4 mile away. Last August, a resident of this local road got in touch to say Roshni (Parmar-Hill, Community Engagement Officer) from the RSPB had been to visit their colony. She asked if we’d be interested in getting involved with developing our Swift Street – thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery – and I eagerly accepted the offer. We used our community messaging group to share the news of the Swift Street development and I was overwhelmed by the local response. So many families were keen to help our Swift population, with more than 80 boxes requested. I think the consensus was that we are so privileged that these incredible urban birds choose our lane as their home, and as their nesting places can be threatened by redevelopment, having the opportunity to install boxes is a wonderful chance to do something proactive to help.  Roshni and I visited local homes who had expressed interest, helping families select potential sites for their boxes to be positioned. With Roshni’s guidance we talked about what Swifts need and I and residents began to understand more about how Swifts live. They are remarkably compatible with humans, don’t need a bird bath, bird table etc. as they feed on insects on the wing. I discovered along with other residents that the best way we could help our Swifts was to protect their current nesting sites, add boxes for more birds to nest in and to do all we could to support insect populations. For example, considering planting in our gardens to promote insect life, adopting No Mow May and not using insecticides. Those who weren’t able to install a box could instead help in other ways, so this made the project accessible for all – everyone could join in. Next came the production of the boxes. Roshni contacted local colleges and we were thrilled when a local skills centre suggested their joinery students could make these free of charge. Production began and numbers of those interested had grown as the message about the project spread, and so 100 boxes were produced.  Meanwhile, local guiding groups learnt of the initiative and Roshni visited the groups that I lead, as Brown Owl – 90 girls and young women were keen to learn about Swifts and how they could help. The groups were already keen to learn about environmental matters, and this project really whetted their appetite. The Brownies, Guides and Rangers designed posters, made seed bombs and grew in their understanding of our Swifts. Once the production of the boxes was finished the Brownies, Rangers and Guides got stuck into painting them with an environmentally friendly product which would protect the boxes, and a local lady Haldis (a RSPB Swift Champion, a voluntary role which supports local conservation efforts to protect the species) made the nest cups which would be inserted into each box.  We arrived at installation day on Saturday 8th March, with 25 boxes going up on that first day. By the end of March, 80 had been erected by a local roofer, Ryan. Of course, we needed to celebrate the returning of our precious Swifts and so we began planning our community event. Volunteers came forward from the surrounding roads and we met in a resident’s kitchen each Wednesday, so all could contribute ideas. Other local guiding groups wanted to contribute and so they made nature-themed bunting, and we were thrilled when the church on the lane offered their venue as a space for us to celebrate. The local dance and drama group wanted to be involved and so their leaders and young people planned songs and a drama production with poetry. And as if we weren’t already exciting enough, we then heard the news that RSPB Ambassador Megan McCubbin would love to come along to formally open our Swift Street.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on 17th May, with a fantastic community event. Sixty families made bee hotels, children had Swift-themed face paint, and a plant swap was popular. RSPB provided and led crafts, and local artists supported youngsters to make Swift puppets. More than 300 residents attended and watched the young people perform. The ribbon was cut revealing a beautiful Swift Street banner created by a local artist, alongside Swift boxes 99 and 100 positioned proudly on the front of the church. And yes, we had Swifts soaring high above us all day (perhaps watching the proceedings?) to the delight of the watching children and residents. As the street party continued into the evening we couldn’t believe our eyes when a ‘banger’ (a young Swift, which gets its name from its tendency to bang against prospective nest to check if they’re occupied or not) attempted to enter one of the newly positioned boxes. A perfect end to a fabulous day.  It’s been an absolute honour to be involved in this project and I feel so lucky that our community have been able to do something practical to support our local Swifts.

"We are delighted to announce the recipients of the 2025 Permaculture Magazine Award, in collaboration with Lush Spring Prize. Four projects have been awarded from a fund of £25,000. The Permaculture Magazine Award is a celebration of the vital work of permaculture projects from around the world. The Permaculture Magazine Award was established in 2018 to celebrate the vital work of permaculture projects around the world. To date (May 2025) it has awarded 28 projects with over £155,000. The award has received hundreds of applications, and it is a privilege to highlight this vital regenerative work that is world changing. Coordinating a network of permaculture centres, NGO Permaculture Ukraine offers training, events and educational resources across Ukraine, also ensuring accessibility for internally displaced people (IDP) and former military personnel. The organisation was founded following the first Permaculture Design Course (PDC) in Ukraine in 2011, and has held at least one PDC annually, actively seeking funding to make training accessible to vulnerable groups. Following the full-scale invasion in 2022, its focus expanded to include: The 14 permaculture centres provide training, shelter for IDPs and war-abandoned animals, and rehabilitation for children and adults. Its designers also create communal projects, including schools and homes for disabled people. Despite air raids and blackouts, NGO Permaculture Ukraine successfully hosted a two-day permaculture festival in Kyiv’s botanical garden in September 2024, drawing 100 participants eager to engage with top regenerative practitioners. NGO Permaculture Ukraine empowers Ukrainians for sustainable living and transformative change. Through active social media engagement and collaborations with ecovillages, zero-waste networks, and other ecological movements, it extends its influence and inspires a growing audience to adopt permaculture principles for Ukraine’s regeneration. https://permaculture.in.ua Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Since its founding in 2021, Battmung has: Recognising the importance of connecting people, Battmung also contributed to the founding of the Permaculture Institute of Korea (P.I.K) in 2023. Its goal is to organise its regional network and regenerate South Korea through permaculture, restoring soil, food chains, ecological awareness, and local economies. www.instagram.com/battmung.log Eco Centro Allpa Tarpuna works for the regeneration of degraded lands, food sovereignty and community autonomy, with a focus on indigenous communities in Ecuador. Founded in 2004, it was born out of the return of its founders to their community after experiencing the negative impacts of conventional agriculture and agrochemicals. This return marked the beginning of a path towards reconnecting with indigenous ancestral knowledge and adopting permaculture and organic production. One of the key achievements has been the recovery of soils degraded by monocultures and eucalyptus. Although slow, this process has demonstrated the benefits of a regenerative approach and strengthened the resilience of the community. Allpa Tarpuna is currently focusing on: Allpa Tarpuna integrates bio-construction, renewable energy and sustainable water management into its practices. It also encourages the preservation of ancestral seeds and agro-ecological techniques such as crop rotation, reducing dependence on chemicals. In the future, it wants to expand its training in permaculture design, combining indigenous knowledge with modern regenerative solutions. It seeks to empower more local farmers, promoting designs that restore the connection between people and nature. Allpa Tarpuna is a living indigenous family that sows regeneration, inspiring a sustainable and resilient balance. https://allpatarpuna.org HortaFCUL is a community-based permaculture project based in Lisbon University’s Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). The initiative was launched by a group of biology students concerned about the gap between sustainability ideals and the university’s environmental impact. This bottom-up project has developed an important role as a catalyst of practical scientific-based knowledge. Nowadays, HortaFCUL is a resilient, sustainable and inclusive community, allowing the general public to learn more about nature-based solutions. It has five subprojects at campus level and relies on a volunteer-based horizontally-organised guardians collective to maintain the project’s green areas. HortaFCUL, as a permaculture project, achieves its central goals by closing functional loops related to human activities.

"As politicians wait, grassroots changemakers are restoring ecosystems and rebuilding resilience. They are living examples that regeneration is not just possible, it’s already happening all over the world.  The Lush Spring Prize 2025 is showcasing this work and has awarded around £250,000 to 19 groups, celebrating regenerative organisations and practitioners from around the world. Lead image: Clockwise from top left: Agro-Pueblos (Colombia), Ñu’u Ndito (Mexico), Global Ecovillage Network (Global), Land in Our Names (UK) In a joyous, collaborative and inspiring week of celebrations, the 2025 recipients were honoured as part of a celebratory event held in Dorset (UK), where the Lush Cosmetics company is headquartered. The event was attended by prize recipients, Spring Prize judges, Lush staff, press, funders and other regenerative practitioners. Co-designed with the prize recipients themselves, the event provides a space to connect, co-learn and share stories of regeneration. It offered an opportunity to explore both the diversity of people and organisations that make up the regenerative movement and the common challenges, learnings and successes that unites it. Each Spring Prize year sees different themes emerge that are shaped by the organisations that receive a prize. In 2025, these include the importance of weaving ancestral wisdom with scientific approaches; working at multiple scales and legally recognising the rights of nature, and learning from those on the frontlines that are facilitating regenerative work in conflict zones or regions experiencing natural disasters. In 2025, the backdrop of violence and conflict looms large. Prize recipients from Lebanon and Ukraine are responding to invasions by powerful aggressors, in Myanmar they are working in a context of ongoing internal conflict and many of the Indigenous groups are frequently facing the threat of violence.  The Spring Prize 2025 event allows these groups to come together and share what regenerative work in these situations looks like in a way that may challenge the existing narrative: “In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the biggest achievement for our organisation is to continue our activities and find ways to be useful for Ukrainian society like creating permaculture public spaces and rehabilitating people in our demonstration centers. The war has taught us that strength is in unity and networks, that autonomous homesteads and farms that grow their own food and preserve their seeds can not only survive but also help other people, and that international support and networks matter.” NGO Permaculture in Ukraine While humanity witnesses declining biodiversity, climate catastrophes and widespread conflict, these organisations highlight how regenerative practices are not just a source of hope but a necessary and much needed response.

Examples of this year’s awarded projects include: Aguaje palm tree seedlings were distributed among Kukama families in Parinari, Loreto, Peru, as part of the reforestation and conservation initiative led by Huaynakana. Extractivism represents a constant threat to the Kukama territory in Peru and the loss of the Kukama peoples’ cultural identity. Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana exists to protect this. The Kukama people conceive of the territory as a whole and women having an intrinsic connection to it. The term ‘kukama’ for example is composed of two words: ‘ku’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘kama’ meaning ‘bosom,’ and it signifies ‘field-bosom’ or ‘nourished by the field.’ Given the Kukama peoples’ lives are reliant on the forest ecosystems of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and considering how they have adapted and coexisted with them for decades, the territory and the rivers are inseparable from their culture and way of life. They consider the rivers to be living beings with spirits, and therefore sacred. Founded in 2001, Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana embarked on a long journey of collective actions, protests, and mobilisations in pursuit of environmental justice as the river’s health declined as a result of extractive industries. In September 2021 Huaynakana filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognise the Marañón River as a living being and subject of rights. In March 2024, the provincial court of Nauta ruled that the Marañón River has intrinsic rights, including the right to flow, to be free from pollution, and to be restored to environmental health. This decision also recognised Indigenous communities as the river’s legal representatives, defenders, and guardians. This landmark ruling was ratified by the higher court last November. Huaynakana plays a key role in defending the Marañón’s rights and supporting the regeneration and conservation of the waterways through reforestation efforts because without the river, these unique forests cannot exist. Mushrooms harvested from the Ubuntu food forest Ubuntu Learning Hub Trust was set up in 2022 with a mission to support people who are in transition towards more resilient futures and a healthier planet. The Trust immediately began to set up the Ubuntu Learning Centre as an open learning space for all ages as well as a demonstration centre for integrating technologies that are in tune with a healthy Mother Earth. The learning centre sits on a two-hectare site in Chikancila village in Chongwe district of Lusaka Province of Zambia. It is founded on the African philosophy of Ubuntu which helps people to learn what it means to be truly human. It hosts people from all walks of life who are looking for pathways to escape the rat race and curve more sustainable futures for themselves, their families and the communities where they come from. The Trust uses agro-ecological practices to regenerate the degraded farmland that was damaged over decades of poor land husbandry. For example, the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) technique has helped to restore much of the indigenous vegetation on the land. People come to Ubuntu to explore the meaning of life and to find their life purpose. They stay at Ubuntu for varying lengths of time and in the process they are engaged in intercultural exchanges as well as learning how to take care of themselves and of Mother Earth. The Trust offers life changing experiences rather than certificates and the opportunity to carve out an earth-centred worldview for themselves. The Cultural Conservancy (TCC) Farm Manager, Amythest Faria, at TCC’s land project Heron Shadow, collecting an early fall harvest. The Cultural Conservancy (TCC) is a Native-led non-profit organisation based in San Francisco, California. Founded in 1985, its mission is to protect and revitalise Indigenous cultures through the direct application of traditional knowledge and practices on ancestral lands. It works with Native/Indigenous peoples locally and globally on community-based projects that are shaped by community requests and guided by the Native Advisory Council of Traditional Knowledge Holders, land-care practitioners, and community leaders. From language revitalisation and traditional carving projects to Indigenous agricultural sciences and traditional land tending, critical to its work is the acknowledgement of the sacred relationship Native peoples have to their lands and waters and the importance of this relationship to their physical, mental, and community health. Through its flagship Native Foodways Programme and its land project Heron Shadow, it: Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Harvesting with Battmung friends The LUSH Spring Prize is a joint venture between LUSH Cosmetics and Ethical Consumer and is now in its sixth prize cycle, having started in 2017. The Spring Prize has distributed more than £1.3 million to regenerative projects worldwide. The LUSH Spring Prize was set up to support ‘regenerative’ projects – those that go beyond sustainability by taking holistic approaches to building the health of ecology, economy and social systems. It seeks to support those who are leaving the world lusher than they found it, and are actively restoring all the systems they are part of. By supporting regenerative projects the Spring Prize hopes to raise the profile of the movement as a whole to inspire more individuals, groups, communities, funders, media platforms and businesses to start engaging with regenerative processes.  The Spring Prize judging panels are made up of people drawn from a diverse range of movements that represent regenerative design, permaculture, food sovereignty, transition towns, biomimicry, eco-village networks and various social justice movements. Each prize cycle a ‘Lush Customer Judge’ and ‘Lush Staff Judge’ are also selected to act as additional independent members of the judging panel.  The collaborative prizes have separate panels, which also include judges from the main Spring Prize panel. The majority of the judging panel for the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Award self identify as Indigenous themselves, some being previous recipients of the award. The judges are not just involved in choosing the recipients but are involved in shaping the prize as a whole, attending the event and connecting with prize recipients. You can read more about the judges here: Spring Prize Judging Panel.

"Around 40 years ago, the Sahel, an extremely arid region located in central Africa, was an area of agricultural desolation. Due to natural factors such as heavy drought and interannual variability, combined with anthropocentric influences like climate change, overgrazing and deforestation, the environment has become particularly unstable with little possibility for productivity.  Furthermore, when rain does fall in the arid region, the soil is so dry due to a lack of precipitation, that water immediately ‘runs off’ or evaporates, failing to soak into the depleted earth. Some countries within the region, such as Burkina Faso, faced up to 24% of their arable lands classed as highly degraded in 1998 (Maatman et al., 1998).  In the early 2000s, NGOs and organisations such as the United Nations, the World Food Programme and WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), amongst others, sought to reverse the desertification of many parts of Africa, including the Sahel, in cooperation with farmers and communities from the affected regions. Using the ancient ‘half moon’ water harvesting technique – used for centuries in Africa and the Middle East, the revitalised technique aims to facilitate water retention and re-green the ecosystem. Heavy machinery or hand tools can be used to plough the soil roughly 30cm down in a semi-circle or ‘half moon’ shape. The diameter of these half moons are typically about 4 metres. When it rains, the contours catch the rainwater, preventing runoff and allowing it to infiltrate the soil. This creates ‘favourable micro-climate conditions’ allowing drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet to be planted.  If planted on steep slopes, half-moon ‘bunds’ can assist the growth of tree species. They can also be used in combination with controlled grazing to boost re-vegetation. In Niger, The World Food Programme (WFP) has been implementing half-moon planting projects since 2014. Just 5 years into the scheme, the benefits of its implementation were examined by a progress-review. In 2019, over 400 households had restored approximately 3,000 acres of land, largely for use in producing food for livestock. This has promoted social cohesion and economic growth by providing more jobs and stabilising agricultural output in a formerly capricious climate. This scenario exhibits the benefits of a localised, small-scale regenerative farming technique such as half-moon planting through its trickle-down effects, stipulating broader socio-economic growth. A study on the impact of reformed agroecological techniques was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Burkina Faso. Figures revealed that fields ploughed using the half-moon method saw the rates of increase for grain yield at 8% (The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 2017). As farmers sought new ways to boost crop yields, regenerative farming techniques such as the half-moon method were found to be successful when used in conjunction with others. In Burkina Faso, half-moon planting is exercised alongside the Zaï technique, which is useful when adapting to various soil types and structures. The Zaï method, suitable to the arid Sahel region, uses similar methods seen in the half-moons, but alternatively involves digging smaller pits in non-permeable soil to intercept water and gather compost material. These pits are slightly smaller than the half-moons and so are less labour intensive and can be utilised in smaller growing plots. They are roughly between 15-50cm across; 5-15cm deep; and positioned 80cm apart. This technique was reintroduced to the area in the 1980s by farmer and agronomist Yacouba Sawadogo, who pioneered the method of filling the holes with manure to further break up the earth and bolster soil productivity.

"Traditional Māori time systems were measured in accordance to the night as opposed to the Western proxy of daylight. Each night of the lunar month had a particular name and this cumulatively formed a lunar calendar known as ‘Maramataka‘. Farming according to the Maramataka lunar calendar is used in conjunction with Māori regenerative farming techniques to adapt to nature’s schedule as opposed to imposing controls on the earth’s processes. Many farmers are now seeking to turn back to these ancient methods in line with broader sustainability imperatives. Under the Maramataka calendar, individual lunar nights were marked according to how optimal they were for catching fish, eels or planting crops, with each night having its own name. A good example is eel fishing. It is not productive on a full moon – Rākaunui – because the moon’s light would not allow eel to hunt their prey, as the prey could see them. As with biodynamics (the Rudolf Steiner lunar approach for farming), planting crops is nest at a full moon, when the gravitational pull is at its highest, because it has maximum influence on water in the soil. “Despite the use of Maramataka being limited to a relative few today, largely because of colonisation, interest in and revival of this knowledge and practice is growing.”1 Many farmers are returning to the use of farming tactics such as Maramataka planting in line with broader regenerative goals. The Revitalise Te Taiao programme aims to fund sustainable and lucrative agribusiness solutions to cultivate Te Taiao (the natural world). This project provided $2.7 million in funding to Miru Young and Mohi Beckham, farmers based in the North Island’s Bay of Plenty, to trial agriculture techniques which aim to “enhance the mana and mauri of the soil” across 10 farm sites. As part of the scheme, both farmers undertook rigorous research, sowing pasture throughout different moon phases from resting and dormant phases to high-energy phases for plant growth. Soon, grass seeds sown during the high energy periods of the Maramataka calendar outgrew neighbouring crops planted in other phases, even if the latter had been sown 10 days before. Despite still being in the trial stages of Maramataka planting, Miru and Mohi observed various positive impacts of the scheme within the first few months. Their land has seen higher productivity and crop yields, with a 93% crop survival rate under Maramataka planting, that is an increase of 13% from the usual 80% under previous methods. One of the main issues associated with returning to traditional farming methods on a broader scale is competing with intensive methods in New Zealand’s modern agricultural industry. After settlers from the West arrived in New Zealand during the 18th and 19th centuries, intensive farming practices quickly became widespread.  As farming in the country has continuously expanded into the modern day, with agricultural exports making up a large proportion of the country’s GDP, traditional farming methods have become far less lucrative in the broader market. This meant that Māori farmers had to adopt newer techniques, as those trying to maintain the traditional methods were faced with far lower crop yields and income. Rural management programmes and sustainability objectives are constantly investigating new and feasible ways to rejuvenate te ao Māori farming techniques, with the Revitalise Te Taiao programme representing just one of many schemes. The Maramataka lunar calendar is part of a broader Maori worldview known as Mātauranga Māori – a term used to describe the collective knowledge of Māori living in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the knowledge passed down from their ancestors. Kaitiakitanga (stewardship/management) and the link between Whakapapa (Māori genealogy/ancestral descent) and Whenua (land) are key areas of te ao Māori and Mātauranga values.  By embracing schools of thought that are native to Aotearoa, alongside promoting equitable stewardship across modern farming methodologies, high agricultural output can be attained. Reforming the agribusiness in New Zealand will involve reintegrating Māori into decision making processes, embracing cross-cultural thought processes and utilising western technological advancements for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.

"Lammas is a celebration of the summer and the gathering in of the grain harvest. This was especially significant in the past. After all the hard work of getting the grain crop cut, threshed, stored and stacked, there came a time for feasting, celebration and assessment. Lammas is a Saxon name meaning ‘Loaf-mass’. Lughnasadh (pronounced Loo-nas-ah) is Irish Gaelic. On Lammas Eve fires were lit on Lammas mounds such as Silbury Hill at Avebury, to honour the Corn Mother as she gives birth to her harvest child, the Grain. This is the seed that will bring next year’s harvest as well as the grain that will sustain life throughout the winter. The month of August was the month of the Grain Mother. An ‘augur’ is an old word for seer and meant ‘increaser’. The great abundance of the Earth Mother is reflected in the titles she was given at this time: The Grain Mother, Barley Mother, Corn Mother, Demeter, Ceres, Cerealia, Grain, the Wise One of the Earth, the Increaser, She who is the seed, who is the womb, who is the soil, the Great Provider, the Preserver of Life. Cutting the ‘corn’ seems to be a general term for all cereal crops, whether they are wheat, barley, rye or oats. There were many customs and rituals throughout Europe to honour the first and the last sheaf of corn to be cut. The last sheaf was often cut by the youngest girl present and fashioned into a Corn Maiden. It was carried joyfully back to the village, sometimes plaited and decked with ribbons, and usually hung over the fireplace. Sometimes it was dressed in women’s clothes, and ritually burnt on the Lammas Fire. Sometimes these Corn Maidens were kept until Yule when they were divided up amongst the cattle or kept until the spring. Sometimes they were kept with the date tied to them. Many Corn Maidens would be seen hanging above the fireplace. In Scotland the ‘young maid’ was made out of the last stalks cut, and kept. The ‘old wife’ was made out of the first stalks cut and was passed on to the nearest farm that had not finished bringing in the corn. This was then passed round until it ended up at the last farm to be cut. Another old European custom was to weave the last sheaf into a large Corn Mother with a smaller corn doll inside it, representing next year’s unborn harvest. The regenerative power of the Earth is never more manifest than now as the grain harvest is gathered in and the Sun’s cycle begins to wane. The Cauldron of Regeneration was central to Celtic spiritual understanding. We are renewed by sleep and darkness, through many deaths and rebirths, and by the sacrifice of our outer lives for the inner journey. Here at Lammas, the doorway to the inner realms is opening. This is the symbolism behind the Demeter/Kore/Persephone story. Demeter, the Corn Mother, represents the ripe corn of this year’s harvest, and Kore or Persephone represents the grain-seed who lives in the dark throughout the winter and reappears in the Spring. Persephone’s descent into the Underworld is a mythical interpretation of the seed lying in the ground during the dark winter months, and her reappearance as the young maid, or the new sprouting seed, in the spring. This story shows us the Triple Goddess in all her aspects: as Earth Mother, the abundant provider; as the Crone, the wisdom found within; and as the Maiden who returns renewed in the spring. Pluto/Hades’ abduction of Persephone is a later reworking of this older myth. After all the manifest energy and activity of the early summer, it is good to make time now to rest and to assimilate all that has happened during the Sun’s active phase. Lammas celebrations would probably have begun with the cutting of the last sheaf of corn. Although the 2nd of August is the calendar date for Lammas, the great Lammas fairs and feasts would probably have lasted from mid July to mid August and would have peaked around the time of the harvest Full Moon. Once the grain had been safely gathered in and the men returned from their hunting trips, it was a time for feasting, dancing and merry-making, a great celebration of the first of the harvest and assessment of the year’s achievements. Beer, wine, cider and whisky made from the previous year’s harvest, were ritually drunk, celebrating the transformative power of Fire and Water. Cooking fires were honoured as they too embodied the power of Fire and Water. Bread was made from the new grain and thanks were given to the Sun’s life energy reborn as the bread of life. This is a busy time for harvesting herbs and collecting herb seeds to sow in the spring. Give thanks and blessings as you pick them, dry them and store them. Review what you know about them and ways you can use them both physically and metaphysically. Harvest sage at the end of July, before the flowers have come out. Sage is a herb associated with wisdom and releasing blocks in expression. It is connected to the throat chakra and is for those who have something to say but cannot let it out. It will help you express your emotions. Make the herb tea in the usual way. The infusion is a useful antiseptic herb for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers and mouth infections. It can be used as a gargle, for bathing wounds, sores, and to stop bleeding. Use the tea infusion externally and then drink afterwards as well. It will dry up excess secretions such as catarrh or sinusitis. It contains oestrogen and is useful in the menopause and for delayed menstruation. Burn dried sage to cleanse and purify. Waft the smoke around a person to cleanse their aura (called smudging). This is a good way to begin any ritual or ceremony. N.B. It must not be taken if pregnant, and because of its drying action, it must not be taken for long periods of time. It will dry up mother’s milk. Care must be taken by those who are insulin-dependent, and to be avoided by epileptics. Garlands of meadowsweet were traditionally worn for the Lammas celebrations. Its heady perfume expands the psyche, and builds inner strength. It enhances flexibility and connection to the inner levels. It is a mild sedative and painkiller containing salicylic acid (aspirin) that affects the rate at which blood clots. It is a good digestive tonic that reduces excess acidity and is useful for heartburn, hyperacidity, gastritis and peptic ulcers. As it cleanses the body of harmful acids, it is useful for any inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is a strong diuretic (increases urine) and can be used for any bladder or kidney complaint including cystitis. It reduces stagnation in the liver and therefore will help the immune system function more effectively. Its harvest time is July and August when the flowers are just beginning to open. Collect them in brown paper bags to dry for later use. N.B. Avoid if on anti-coagulant drugs. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Sacred Earth Celebrations, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"There are various methods for drying herbs for herbal recipes but they all require that the herb is dried and stored out of the light. I prefer to use brown paper bags, other people hang them up in bunches or lay them between sheets of newspaper or brown paper. • If using brown paper bags always label the bags with the name of the herb, the date and where you picked it. This is good practice and a good habit to get into as plants can change a lot in the drying process. Even if you think you will know what it is, it is surprising how you can forget, especially if you bag up several herbs over a period of a few weeks. • Leave the bags in a dry warm environment for several weeks. Put them in the airing cupboard if you have one, hang over the wood-burner or leave them on top of radiators. Shake the bags and turn the leaves over with your hands every day or two. It is essential to do this to stop any mould getting in to the herbs while they are still drying. • The herbal properties of leaves and flowers will deteriorate after 1 year so they need to be re-collected every year. Fruit, seeds, berries, roots and bark will last for 2 years. It is light that destroys the herbal properties of herbs, so at its simplest herbs can be stored all year in brown paper bags, although if they are kept in the kitchen they will need to be kept in a plastic container or airtight tin to keep them dry. Keeping the herbs in a dedicated leather or cotton bag is the traditional medicine way and these are hung somewhere warm and dry, near a radiator or fire. Putting them into dark glass jars is good in a kitchen because of the condensation. Clear jam jars are fine if they are kept in a dark cupboard. At its simplest the jar can be kept in a brown paper bag or more creative ways can be found. Herb teas vary in taste and quality. Buying popular blends as tea bags is convenient, but be aware that the herbs may be old by the time you drink them, and the herbs may have been grown in monocultures and sprayed with petrochemicals. It is infinitely better to make your own. • Making herb teas is not an exact science, especially when using the common safe plants. Interestingly, different herbalists use different amounts. I use about a teaspoonful of dried herbs or a small pile that fits into the hollow of my palm, and between a half to a pint of water, depending on the need. Use less for young children and anyone who is weak and frail. Dried herbs have twice the strength of fresh herbs, so twice the amount of fresh herb is used. • As you make the tea, say thank you to the plant. This open-hearted attitude adds to the healing process. I like to picture the plant and affirm its healing qualities as I wait for the tea to brew, partly to affirm the healing I am engaged in and also as a memory aid. This way I keep learning and understanding more about the plants all the time and keep my knowledge strong. Many of the herbs are an acquired taste. Nurture an openness to these wild flavours and earthy tastes and give them a chance. More often than not, a taste you didn’t like at first becomes a taste that you find you love. These are also for adults only as they are a mixture of brandy and honey. This makes them a most delicious way to take your medicine! They are especially good to use when travelling as they are kept in small dropper bottles and taken neat. Elixirs are combination remedies, created for specific uses and personal needs. Elixirs need to taste good so the addition of any aromatic herbs improves the flavour, but must also support the over-all herbal action. They are experimental and fun, as well as being extremely effective and I like to give them creative names. Write up everything in your Herb Journal. This is especially important when you make combination elixirs. Recording the plants and proportions used is invaluable when you create something you want to repeat. Method one 1. Half fill a dark jar with a herb or combinations of herbs: tear the leaves, crush the seeds or fruit, and chop the roots. Send your thanks to the plants. Add a little of something that will give it a nice flavour such as rose petals, sweet violet, lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena etc, making sure that their actions support the overall use of the remedy. 2. Cover the plant matter with clear runny honey and send your silent thanks to the bees. Poke well with a chopstick to get out any trapped air bubbles and break the plant matter up further. 3. Then top the jar up with brandy and 4. Put on the lid and label, date and shake well. Give it a poke and a shake frequently and keep out of bright light. They are ready in about a month, although they come to no harm if they are left longer. 5. Strain off the plant matter and rebottle in clean dark dropper bottles. Pour a little boiling water over the mash of herbs that are left over, getting every last bit of goodness out of them. Toast the plant and its medicine and have your first taste before returning the spent mash to the earth with thanks. Method two Create an instant elixir using the tinctures you have made. 1. Using a jug combine several tinctures that support the remedy you are making. 2. Mix in a similar amount of honey to tincture and mix the two together. 3. Pour into dark dropper bottles. Name and date and write up in your herb journal. Their dosage is similar to tinctures, although I tend to use them little and often. Here are some suggestions of plants to choose from, depending on what you have available. I have listed the native plants first and the aromatics at the end. Anti-stress elixir Hawthorn, cowslip, vervain, rose petals, lavender, borage. Drops of calm Hawthorn, elderflowers, cowslip, hops, valerian, vervain, rose petals, borage, lavender, chamomile. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Letting in the Wild Edges, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"Growing my own mulch has long been a goal of mine. We use a lot of mulch in the nursery and garden and at the moment I have no problem sourcing straw but if/when the day comes that the farmers start using their own straw to improve their soil (which is becoming a more common practice), I’ll be needing to step up my mulch growing efforts. Currently, I grow enough mulch to sustain my perennial beds and around 10% of my annual beds but rely on imported straw for mulching the other 90% of annual vegetable and nursery beds. My ideal mulch plant grows fast, is drought tolerant, competes minimally with crop plants, does not contain seed that easily spreads, is easy to handle and cut, i.e. not thorny/prickly or tough and fibrous, and can biodegrade relatively quickly (thereby returning the nutrients back to soil). I’ve broadly categorized the main sources of mulch we produce in our 1500m2 garden. Aquatic plants
I grow emergent wetland species such us cattails (Typha spp), sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) on the banks of a small pond (6m x 3m), and within a grey water reed bed (1m x 6m). The pond also provides suitable habitat for hornworts (Ceratophyllum spp). a submerged rootless perennial that gathers on the surface en masse. This plant makes an excellent mulch being rich in nitrogen, growing very fast and is easy to position around the base of plants. The emergent species provide a good thick carbon rich mulch that helps to reduce evaporation on the terrestrial beds and I cut these back in the spring in case they are used for overwintering invertebrates. Aquatic plants are an excellent source of mulch as there are no issues with seed germinating amongst your land based crops. Tap rooted perennial / biennials
Deep rooted perennial plants tend to produce a good amount of biomass, are generally drought tolerant and do not compete strongly with our crop plants. I have found native biennial weeds such as greater burdock (Arctium lappa), a very useful mulch plant with the gigantic leaves growing back very fast after a cut. Lesser burdock (Arctium minus), is also useful albeit to lesser extent. Although biennial, if you cut back these plants before flowering you can prolong their life, harvesting good quantities of seed free biomass. I do eventually allow some of the plants to flower and they are much loved by bees among other insects. Comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum), ‘bocking 14’, is a classic example of a deep rooted mulch plant. We have the plant scattered throughout the garden and planted in dedicated patches. The plants do require irrigation however and will only provide good leaf yields if grown on fertile soil. Peeing on the plants is recommended. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), provide a great source of biomass. For a good tuber harvest it’s best to wait until the end of the season before harvesting the mulch. We can never consume as much as we produce of these tubers in the kitchen. I have found them to be much appreciated by our pigs and an excellent source of fresh winter food for our rabbits. Leaves of greater burdock (Arctium lappa) Nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs 
These plants take a while to establish but make an excellent contribution. I’ve had good results from coppicing empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), when they are 3-years-old and chop and dropping the soft new growth three or four times a year. I am expecting to also see good results from grey alder (Alnus incana) and Italian alder (Alnus cordata). I avoid using thorny nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs for this purpose. Annual trimming of shrubs such as autumn olive – Elaeagnus umbellata and broom – Cytisus scoparius also provides good quantities of mulch. Click here for more info on nitrogen fixing plants. Lawn and ground cover
One of my favourite sources of mulch is lawn trimmings. They are great for mulching potted plants or applying a mulch into tight spots. Mixed species lawns will contain a more diverse mix of mineral nutrients. Lawns including a legume such as white clover (Trifolim repens), can provide a nitrogen rich mulch. It’s a good idea to leave some of the trimmings behind to keep the lawn healthy. Autumn leaf fall and herbaceous stem residue
The annual shedding of leaves from trees and shrubs in our garden make a great contribution to our mulch capital. Leaves can be cleared from paths, lawns and wildflower beds (as they will disrupt the growth in these areas) and concentrated where they are of benefit such as the base of high demanding fruiting shrubs such as blackcurrants or blackberries. Herbaceous perennials such as lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis) and mints (Mentha spp). will provide dead stems annually. It’s always a good idea to leave hollow stems of some herbaceous perennials to remain for the winter as they are utilized by invertebrates for egg laying and hibernating. If the plant does not have a hollow stem it can be cut back and used for mulch. Fennel (Foeniculm vulgare), provides large quantities of biomass and as far as I can tell the stems are not utilised by any organism over the winter. In the vegetable garden all the remnants of my crops after harvesting go straight back to the surface for recycling. Foeniculum vulgare and other herbaceous perennials Tree prunings
Woody prunings from shrubs, trees and vines cut into small pieces (5-10cm) make good mulch in the mature areas of the forest garden with well established fungal soils specializing in breaking down the lignified woody material. Living mulches 
In the more mature areas of the garden where the trees have established (5yrs and older) I have dispensed with mulch all together in favour of ground cover plants that can be considered living mulches. Some the most successful perennial living mulches I have found that form good dense cover in the shade include bugle (Ajuga reptans), spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), Caucasian stonecrop (Sedem spurium), perwinkle (Vinca major) and betony (Stachys officinalis). Lamium maculatum spreading well under a mullbery (Morus alba) Scaling up mulch production
In order to grow enough mulch to provide a water retaining, weed excluding barrier for my annual and nursery beds I would certainly need more space. A larger wetland area would be ideal, with aquatic species growing very fast and the seed bearing parts of the plants being non problematic to use on terrestrial beds. If you don’t have a reliable aquatic habitat, the next best option for growing quantities of mulch without irrigation and fertilization is probably grass. During my next post I’ll be sharing a plan where using the lessons garnered from small scale systems, we’ll be growing mulch to support approx 670 fruit trees and 1360 soft fruit shrubs on a 5ha Agroforestry Project (design layout below).

"There are many medicinal uses for elder – Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae family). It is an evocative tree, steeped in history, tradition, and folklore. This is one of our great food and medicinal plants, easily found in most areas of the British Isles where people have settled. It’s botanical name, Sambucus nigra, stems from the Greek word sambuke; a ‘musical pipe’, due to its hollow form supplying our ancestors a perfect wood for making pipes. The Latin ‘nigra’, means black, in allusion to the dark colour of ripe elder berry fruit. Elder is a deciduous woodland and hedgerow plant, native to Northern Europe and North America, and can be seen happily growing on most types of soil up to altitudes of approximately 470m. Superstition says to not cut elder down or burn them. This may be purely because of the toxic fumes which rise from burning elder wood, or it may be that the faeries will be really upset because you are destroying such a useful plant! Other legends have grown around this plant, such as that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who allegedly betrayed Jesus to the Romans, then said to have hanged himself from its branches. This story gave rise to the name of the edible fungus found all year round on the elder – the Jelly Ear. Elder can sometimes be found growing as a shrubby form, and sometimes like a tree on a single trunk, similar to other woodland-edge plants like hazel, hawthorn and blackthorn. A mature elder typically displays a domed crown, and will be spotted from a distance once you know it. Elders can reach 8m or more, although more commonly 5-6m or so, because of other limiting environmental factors. Ideally the plant likes a rich and damp soil in a sunny position. Elder does not like exposed sites or windy hillsides. The branches display numerous lenticels (air holes) and produce their stems with opposite pairs of buds. The buds are naked, without bud scales. The light brown, corky bark pattern on elder can appear quite similar to the invasive exotic, the ‘butterfly bush’ – Buddleja davidii. The similarity between Sambucus and Buddleja ends there. Elder’s leaves are completely different in form. They are compound, comprising of seven oval, serrated leaflets, each being about 7-10cm long. The leaflets typically come in two or three opposite pairs with one terminal leaflet. They are a much lighter green colour than the Himalayan native ‘butterfly bush’ which has a simple, lanceolate / elliptical leaf. You will find this year’s flowers and fruits on last year’s growth. The umbel-like elderflowers, (technically corymbs), are borne on terminal stems. Five creamy-white petals surround the yellow anthers. When ripe, and picked on a sunny day, are bursting with pollen and scent, and should be a bright lemon-yellow. They turn brown when past their best. Only pick ripe flowers! The flowers have a small amount of natural yeast on them which assists fermentation when making drinks. This will be testified by anyone who makes the superb thirst quenching elderflower champagne! The rank smell of elder leaves or the gone-over flowers is known to repel many who come across it, often being described as a cat urine smell!  After a short but sweet period in full bloom, the flowers give rise to upstanding clusters of small berries, which are typically no bigger than 10mm in diameter. Initially green, the berries gradually begin to nod earthwards as they ripen. At the end of the summer they are dark purple – with many medicinal uses. Parts used Flowers, berries, leaves, bark, fungi. Harvest time The flowers are picked when in full bloom. The berries are picked when ripe in the autumn. Key active medicinal constituents Tannins, potassium, mucilage, phenols, triterpenes, sterols, lectins, flavonoids (including rutin). The dark coloured berries are rich in anthocyanins, folic acid and vitamins A and C. They also contain flavonoids, and cyanidin glucosides, which are poisonous in large doses.  Medicinal actions Diaphoretic, febrifuge, anti-catarrhal, anti viral, immuno-supportive. Uses – Elderflowers and berries are expectorant and diaphoretic, thus they help to manage and reduce fevers and to rid the body of toxins. – Elderflowers are also anti-viral and are useful in combating herpes simplex type 1 virus (responsible for cold sores). – The flowers can be made into champagne, cordials, wine, sorbet, jam and fritters. – Elderberry extract has been proven to inhibit various strains of flu, especially if taken early enough. Many people can testify that elder can significantly reduce recovery times from influenza. – Some books have stated the ripe berries are poisonous, but this is slightly misleading. They will cause gastric upset if you eat a large quantity raw, (as will too many apples while scrumping) but in small amounts they should present no problem. Cooked into jams, syrups etc., larger quantities of elderberries are absolutely fine. – Pioneering contemporary forager-chefs have rediscovered that even the green berries can be used, as ‘capers’, if prepared correctly. This involves fermenting the berries in a salt brine solution for a few days, similar to preparing green walnuts for pickling, and then covering in a flavoured vinegar. – Even when the tree is dormant in the winter, it is still possible to harvest food! The ‘Jelly ear’ fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is often found on elder, dead or alive. Known as a delicacy in China, it is best cooked sliced into thin strips, in a spicy, oriental-style soup.

"There’s a plethora of info out there about comfrey but not much detail regarding establishing and managing a comfrey patch so I thought I would write an article to share my experience on this and how we grow comfrey as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden. A member of the borage family, comfrey – Symphytum spp. is native to Europe and Asia and there are 40 recorded species throughout that region. The plant most commonly referred to and used in gardens is Russian comfrey – Symphytum x uplandicum, a naturally occurring hybrid of two wild species: common comfrey – Symphytum officinale and prickly comfrey – Symphytum asperum. A few centuries back, the hybrid Symphytum x uplandicum came to the attention of Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) and he widely promoted the plant as a food and forage crop. Years later, and after two world wars, Lawrence D Hills (1911-1991) would continue Henry Doubleday’s Comfrey crusade. In the 1950s, Hills developed a comfrey research program in the village of Bocking, near Braintree in the UK. The original trial site is on the plot of land now occupied by the Doubleday Gardens housing development. Lawrence Hills lived at 20 Convent Lane just around the corner of the trial site. At this site, Hills trialed at least 21 comfrey ‘strains’, each one named after the village Bocking. Strain 14 was identified as being the most nutrient rich, non-seeding strain and ‘Bocking 14’ began its journey into gardens far and wide across the world. (Learn more its history on the Balkan Ecology Project blog.) Medicinal – Comfrey has been cultivated as a healing herb since at least 400BC. The Greeks and Romans commonly used comfrey to stop heavy bleeding, treat bronchial problems and heal wounds and broken bones. Poultices were made for external wounds and tea was consumed for internal ailments. Comfrey has been reported to promote healthy skin with its mucilage content that moisturizes and soothes and promotes cell proliferation. This plant is my first port of call if ever I need to dress a wound. Simply take a few leaves brush them together to remove the hairs and wrap them around the wound and apply light pressure. It’s incredibly effective at stopping the bleeding, reducing the pain and healing the wound. Biomas – Comfrey produces large amounts of foliage from late May (late spring) until hard frosts in October or November (late autumn). The plant is excellent for producing mulch and can be cut from 2-5 times per year depending on how well the plants are watered and fed. The plant grows rapidly after each harvest. In our gardens we have Comfrey ‘Bocking 14’ located next to each fruit tree in order to have a renewable source of mulch just where we need it. We also grow in patches as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden and have patches in the wildflower meadows (details below). We’ve supplied 1,000 ‘Bocking 14’ cuttings to Oxygenisis, a business in Germany who are experimenting with using this plant for carbon capture. Mineral dam – Comfrey has deep roots of up to 2m that utilize nutrients deep in the subsoil that would otherwise wash away with the underground soil water or remain inaccessible to other plants. The nutrients, once taken up from the roots, are relocated throughout the plant as and where needed with some of them ending up in the comfrey leaf mass. When cutting the leaf mass and applying to the soil surface, the mined nutrients are returned and again made accessible to shallower rooted crop plants.  Biodiversity – The bell shaped flowers provide nectar and pollen to many species of bees and other insects from late May until the first frosts in late autumn. Lacewings are said to lay eggs on comfrey and spiders overwinter on the plant. Parasitoid wasps and spiders will hunt on and around comfrey. Pest and disease prevention and control – Research indicates that a comfrey solution can be used to prevent powdery mildew. Pest predators such as spiders, lacewings and parasatoid wasps associate with this plant. It’s best to leave some plants alone in order to sustain pest predator relationships. Ground cover – Some species can quickly spread to form a thick ground cover and work particularly well for ground cover on the sunny side under shrubs and trees. Symphytum tuberosum – Tuberous Comfrey seems to be the best species for this.  Fertilizer – Comfrey leaves contain a great balance of major plant nutrients (N,P,K) and can be fed to plants as powder, direct mulch or by steeping chopped comfrey leaves in water for several weeks to produce a thick, dark liquid that can be diluted with water and applied to plant roots. More on this below. Nutritional value of comfrey – You can see from the below table that wilted comfrey contains significantly higher quantities of potash compared to other organic fertilizers. It’s well recorded that comfrey is an excellent source of potassium (K) a major plant nutrient that is required by plants in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction. Animal fodder – Comfrey has a long history for use as an animal feed. Lawrence D Hills dedicated books to this topic.* The leaves are best received by animals wilted. Fresh leaves can be eaten by pigs, sheep, and poultry but cattle, rabbits and horses will only consume wilted leaves. Human consumption – Symphytum officianale and Symphytum x uplandicum are both reported to be used for salad and potherb and are best when cooked. Personally I’m not keen on the texture but will have the occasional nibble from the garden using the new growth to mix in a spring green salad. Caution – Although comfrey has been used as a food crop, in the past 20 years scientific studies reported that comfrey may be carcinogenic, since it appeared to cause liver damage and cancerous tumors in rats. These reports have temporarily restricted development of comfrey as a food crop. In light of this, the regular consumption of comfrey is not advisable.  Life cycle – Herbaceous perennial Growth habit – Comfrey begins growth in early-April and by early May compact clusters of young leaves are visible in the crown of the old plant. Within a few weeks, the leaf blades with long petioles have grown to over 35cm high. Basal leaves are large, lance-shaped, stalked, and coarsely hairy. The leaves die back following the first frost and remain dormant for winter. Many species can spread vigorously via seed and are generally not welcome in the garden because of this. Other species can spread via tubers and all species quickly regenerate from broken root pieces.  Flowering – Starts in late May or early June and continues until the first frost in late autumn. The bell-shaped flowers with pedicels are in terminal cymes or one-sided clusters. Flowers of common comfrey are usually creamy yellow, but white, red, or purple types have been found in Europe. Prickly comfrey has pink and blue flowers while Russian comfrey has blue, purple, or red-purple flowers. Tuberous comfrey has creamy white flowers. Vegetative growth does not cease with the start of flowering, and the plant will add new stems continuously during the growing season. Most comfrey plants can be somewhat invasive, spreading via seed to parts of the garden where they are not wanted. ‘Bocking 14’ will flower and provide nectar and pollen but will not produce viable seed. Roots – Some species have short, thick, tuberous roots such as Symphytum tuberosum. Others such as Symphytum x uplandicum have deep and expansive root systems. Light – Needs full sun for good biomass production but grows fine in the shade. Shade – Tolerates light shade (about 50%). Moisture – Some species are drought tolerant e.g. Symphytum tuberosum. Cultivated plants require irrigation. USDA Hardiness Zone – 4-9 comfrey crowns and roots are very winter hardy.  Soil – Comfrey is adaptable to many soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils.  pH – Tolerates a wide range (6.5-8.5), although not very sensitive to soil pH, highest yields are reported to occur on soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Perhaps you’re interested in growing comfrey to feed your animals, for medicine, for mulch, for compost or you’re slightly masochistic and want to roll around naked in the pricky beds of biomass (not me). In any case, here’s how to do it. The plant we use in our gardens is Symphytum x uplandicum – ‘Bocking 14’. A sterile cultivar that produces copious quantities of nutrient dense biomass. The following information is based on using this plant.  Choosing the site – We’re growing for biomass and want the plants to receive as much light as possible. Accordingly, we lay out our beds on an east to west axis (we’re in the northern hemisphere).  Irrigation is necessary if you want to get good yields from the plants so picking a place with access to irrigation is of paramount important.  In areas of low rainfall, using the gradient of the land to channel precipitation towards your beds will reduce the water needs of your plants. In areas of high rainfall with a high water table you should consider diverting water away from the beds. Once established, comfrey is difficult to get rid of, so choose a site where you want it to stay. Don’t plant comfrey in any area you cultivate, as the broken root pieces quickly establish into new plants and can out compete slower growing crops.  Position comfrey downhill from where you expect leachate to be present, i.e downhill from a manure pile , compost heap, outside toilet, animal pen etc., can provide passive fertility to the plants and rescue otherwise lost minerals from draining away with the sub soil ground water. 
Grow the comfrey where you want to use it. As you’ll see later we may be harvesting over 1/4 ton biomass from our patch and don’t want to be carrying that over long distances. Preparing the site – Raised beds are a major part of our fertility strategy and overtime retain water and nutrients very efficiently. I use 1.3m wide beds surrounded by 50cm paths for our crops as this allows easy access for harvesting everywhere in the beds without ever having to tread on the soil and the paths are wise enough to take our lawnmower. To form a bed, the area should be cleared of all plants, which is best achieved by sheet mulching the season before. Pernicious perennials or tap rooted biennials should be dug out. After you have cleared the whole area, mark out the bed shape with string and dig out 50cm wide paths around your beds, applying the soil to the surface of the planting area and thereby creating the initial rise of the bed. Fork over the beds well. If a hardpan is present take the time and effort to eliminate it before planting. Depending on the quality of your soil you may want to add extra compost before planting into the bed. If you have sheet mulched the area before hand, with the additional soil from the paths all you need to do is add a good 20cm thick straw mulch (or some other mulch) and it’s ready for planting. A good mulch to start with will help keep the weeds down while your comfrey gets going. You can alter the depth and gradient of the paths to facilitate the required direction of water movement. Planting material – You can plant out with crown divisions or root cuttings best done in the spring when the soil has warmed. A crown division can be obtained from simply putting a spade through the center of a mature comfrey plant and transplanting the divided sections. For our beds, I divided two year old plants into quarters, sometimes sixths, and these established very well in the first year. It’s bests not to harvest the leaf biomass in the first year in order to allow a deep root system to develop. However if you use large divisions you can start harvesting in July. Root cuttings are a great way to plant out large areas of comfrey. The cuttings should be grown on in small pots with 50% compost 50% river sand mix kept moist and planted out in the spring as soon as the first leaves emerge and the soil has warmed. If you are planting large numbers of root cuttings you can plant directly into the beds by creating ‘nests’ in the straw, adding two cupped handfuls of the above mentioned potting mix and plant the cuttings into this. Keep them moist like a wrung out sponge and the success rate will be very close to 100%. Spacing – The plants should be spaced 60cm apart in rows and 60cm apart at diagonals between rows. Plant the rows 15cm from the edge of the beds. Cutting – In the first year allow the plants to establish so that the roots develop well and penetrate deep into the subsoil. Remove any weeds around the plants leaving them on the surface. The following year the cutting can begin. You can scythe the beds for a quick harvest or cut each plant individually with a pair of secateurs or shears cutting to 5cm or so from ground level. The leaves are prickly so if you have sensitive hands wear gloves. Cut the comfrey as the flowering stalks emerge up to four times a year. Allow the plants to flower at least once during the season to provide bee fodder to a range of native bees and honey bees. Leave the last flush of leaves before the winter so that invertebrates can find winter shelter in the undergrowth. You may need to weed between cuts every now and then but generally the comfrey will quickly cover the surface. Feeding – After you have cut the comfrey, mow the pathways between the beds and empty the trimmings to the base of the comfrey plants. Any trimmings from lawns and hedges in the surrounding area can also be used. We are experimenting with growing nitrogen fixing hedging and ground cover plants adjacent to the patch in order to feed our comfrey. A most excellent comfrey feed is undiluted urine applied at a rate of approx 500 ml per plant twice per growing season. Irrigation – Comfrey will produce more biomass if irrigated and in dry climates it’s essential to irrigate. Comfrey plants wilt very fast in hot conditions and will stop photosynthesising at this point. Twenty litres per m2 per week of drought should be more than adequate. The beauty of biological systems are that, if managed properly, each year the soils improve and the ability of the soil to store water will improve over time. We use passive irrigation diverting water from a mountain stream into the paths around the beds. The paths fill with water, we raise the level by blocking the low points with sacks of sawdust and the water is drawn throughout the soil via capillary action. Passive irrigation in our market garden. The paths fill with water and the water permeates throughout the soil via capillary action. As mulch – Freshly cut comfrey leaves make good mulch because they have high nitrogen content, and don’t pull nitrogen from the soil while decomposing. Comfrey’s high potassium content makes it especially beneficial for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, berries, and fruit trees. With adequate feed and watering we’ve seen yields of 2-3kg of biomass per plant per cut. Comfrey beds establishing well. This bed was planted with divided crowns 5 months prior to this photo being taken. Liquid fertliser – What I like to call ‘Comfert’. Fill a barrel, preferably with a bottom tap and a gauze on the inside (to prevent clogging) about 3/4 full with freshly cut comfrey and add water to fill the barrel. Cover it, and let it steep for 3-6 weeks. The smell from the resulting liquid is far from attractive so approach with caution. The tea may be used full strength or diluted by half or more. Don’t apply before heavy rain is forecast as most of the nutrients suspended in the liquid will wash straight through the soil. For the best results apply the feed to your vegetables when they are in most need of the extra fertility. This will be different for each crop, for example, tomatoes are best fed when they are setting fruit and then any time during the fruiting period. Applying comfert before this can be counter productive and make your plants more susceptible to pest problems. The black slurry at the bottom of the barrel can be dispersed evenly back over the comfrey patch. Liquid fertilizer concentrate – ‘Comfert Plus’ can also be made by packing fresh-cut comfrey tops into an old bucket, weighing them down with something heavy, covering tightly, and waiting a few weeks for them to decompose into a black slurry. You can put a hole in the bottom of the bucket and collect the concentrate in another container as it drips out. Dilute this comfrey concentrate about 15 to 1 with water, and use as you would comfert. You can seal this concentrate in plastic jugs until you are ready to use it. Warning! Comfert stinks like hell. My nieces came to visit from London last year and offered to help out in the market garden. One of the tasks that day was to apply comfert to the crops. Let’s just say it did not end well and we had a much better experience taking softwood cuttings the next day. According to Martin Crawford in Creating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops, one cut of comfrey from one plant contains 0.5g of Nitrogen (N) and 10g of potassium (K) to crops. Based on this I calculated how much Potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and biomass the 13 m2 comfrey patch can potentially produce in a year. Below is a table indicating how many comfrey cuts are needed to meet the Nitrogen and Potassium needs of various moderate and heavy cropping fruit and nut trees and annual vegetables. In the 1960s, Lawrence D. Hills used UK gardeners records for a comfrey report. (See the Balkan Ecology Project blog for the results.) Based on these records I calculated a yield of approx. 5.5kg of biomass per plant each year. Using this figure one of our beds should produce approx 286kg of biomass. We shall see as this year we begin our own records. We’re looking to gather some solid data on how comfrey performs in our climate and we’ll be recording the yields from our patch starting this season and for at least the next five years. For more info on our record keeping and research programs see Polyculture Market Garden Study. If you would like to join the ‘who can grow the most comfrey’ experiment and contribute data to our records, send us an email. It will be great to have records from all over the world.

"Hugelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, means hill culture or hill mound. Instead of putting branches, leaves and grass clippings in bags by the curbside for the bin men… build a hugel bed. Simply mound logs, branches, leaves, grass clippings, straw, cardboard, petroleum-free newspaper, manure, compost or whatever other biomass you have available, top with soil and plant your veggies. The advantages of a hugel bed are many, including: The gradual decay of wood is a consistent source of long-term nutrients for the plants. A large bed might give out a constant supply of nutrients for 20 years (or even longer if you use only hardwoods). The composting wood also generates heat which should extend the growing season. Soil aeration increases as those branches and logs break down… meaning the bed will be no till, long term. The logs and branches act like a sponge. Rainwater is stored and then released during drier times. Actually you may never need to water your hugel bed again after the first year (except during long term droughts). Sequester carbon into the soil. On a sod lawn Sepp Holzer (hugelkultur expert) recommends cutting out the sod, digging a one foot deep trench and filling the trench with logs and branches. Then cover the logs with the upside down turf. On top of the turf add grass clippings, seaweed, compost, aged manure, straw, green leaves, mulch, etc…  Sepp Holzer recommends steep hugel beds to avoid compaction from increased pressure over time. Steep beds mean more surface area in your garden for plants and the height makes easy harvesting. The greater the mass, the greater the water-retention benefits. Hugel bed dug in clay with logs put in vertically, next branches and lots of wood chips. Top 6 inches will be wood chips and dirt. This bed will store water and give nutrients for many years to come. Straw bale gardens require less soil, less water and hold heat. As the straw breaks down nutrients feed the plants. Combining a straw surround with a hugel interior, topped by lasagne layering is an excellent idea for an area with poor quality soil. Hugel bed in Ontario, Canada (June 28th) by Tim Burrows. Tim surrounded his very tall hugel bed in pallets! Sheet mulching (lasagne gardening) is like composting in place. Above: just a suggestion as to sheet mulching layers. Nitrogen-rich material such as fresh grass clippings or green leaves put right on the hugelkultur wood would help jump start the composting process. Could also include seaweed, straw, dead leaves, leaf mould, etc.

The first year of break down means the wood (and fungi) steal a lot of the nitrogen out of the surrounding environment, so adding nitrogen during the first year or planting crops that add nitrogen to the soil (like legumes) or planting species with minimal nitrogen requirements is necessary, unless there is plenty of organic material on top of the wood. After the wood absorbs nitrogen to its fill, the wood will start to break down and start to give nitrogen back in the process. In the end you will be left with a beautiful bed of nutrient rich soil. Tree types that work well in hugelkultur:
Hardwoods break down slowly and therefore your hugel bed will last longer, hold water for more years and add nutrients for more years. But softwoods are acceptable as well, a softwood bed will just disintegrate quicker. Mixing woods with softwoods and branches on top, to give off nutrients first, and hardwoods on bottom, sounds like a plan if you have access to multiple types of wood. Yet the newly decomposing softwoods at the top will eat up a lot of nitrogen at first, so compensate for that.

Woods that work best:
Alders, apple, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, oak, poplar, willow (make sure it is dead or it will sprout).

Trees types that work okay:
Black cherry (use only rotted), camphor wood (well aged), cedar/juniper/yew (anti-microbial/anti-fungal, so use only at very bottom or unless already well-aged. Cedar should be broken down before new plant roots reach it), eucalyptus (slightly anti-microbial), osage orange (exceptionally resistant to decay), Pacific yew (exceptionally resistant to decay), pine/fir/spruce (tannins and sap), red mulberry (exceptionally resistant to decay).

Tree types to avoid:
Black locust (will not decompose), black walnut (juglone toxin), old growth redwood (heartwood will not decompose and redwood compost can prevent seed germination).

"Thistles are a bane of picnickers and campers. Who hasn’t trodden on the sharp, unforgiving spines of a thistle when out and about barefoot in grasslands? For many people, relationships with thistles have generally been painful and irritable, but now you can get your own back! One of the great things about thistles is that every single species is edible, so this is great news for foraging beginners! Even the closest lookalikes found here are edible – the sow thistles (Sonchus spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), so when working with the thistles, you can learn to identify and proceed to experiment with complete confidence from the outset. We have at least 14 species of thistle growing wild in the UK, mostly from the Cirsium (aka plume thistles) and Carduus genera. Thistles are found in numerous settings all over our islands and can be a useful soil barometer. Often their presence signifies that the land is fertile, and in many instances, neglected. I eat from a number of different species. These are: creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis), spear thistle (C. vulgare), woolly thistle (C. eriophorum), marsh thistle (C. palustris), and welted thistle (Carduus acanthoides syn C. crispus). As you will discover, plants that have spines to offer protection against predators, have no real need for bitterness. Spear thistle It’s almost impossible to misidentify a thistle. One of the easy-to-spot botanical differences between thistles and their numerous relatives in the daisy family, is that the overlapping bracts (involucre) found directly below the flowers of thistles, are always spiny. Simple! The leaves of the numerous species will differ in size, shape and the density of spine coverage. Most have stiff spines on the margins, but some have soft prickles. You need to discover for yourself which are the more tactile! When in flower, most thistles produce a lovely purple / mauve bloom, but some species are known for their yellow inflorescence (cabbage thistle – Cirsium oleraceum and the Carline thistle – Carlina vulgaris). In all of the thistles, flowers give way to copious amounts of fluffy hairs (pappus) attached to their tiny fruits, superbly designed for air-borne dispersal. A distinguishing feature between the two main generais that Cirsium spp. produce feathered pappus hairs, whereas Carduus spp. only have simple pappus hairs. Creeping thistle produces dense spines on its leaves, but very few spines or hairs on the flowering stems. Spear thistle has large, deeply-lobed leaves with large spines at the margins, as well as hairy, spiny stems. Marsh thistle looks somewhat like spear thistle at an initial glance, but without the large spines and leaf lobes, and usually with a thin, red, leaf margin. Woolly thistle is easily identifiable with large, deeply-lobed, evenly-shaped leaves, and very large flower heads, wrapped in a ‘cobweb’ of cotton-like hairs. This particular species is the largest wild thistle I use, although if you have milk thistle (Silybum marianum) growing in your plot, you can use that too, but you will need good gloves to protect yourself from its long spiny flower heads! Eating milk thistle chokes would of course prevent you harvesting the exceptional liver-supportive medicine found in the seeds. Wooly thistle Creeping thistle will grow in all manner of waste-ground, grasslands, verges and field edges. I also see a lot of spear thistle in similar habitats, although when found in grassland, it’s not as abundant as the creeping species. The root systems explain why; spear thistle has a tap root, whereas creeping thistle grows on rhizomes. The marsh thistle, as its name alludes to, likes damp conditions such as fens, marshes, canal tow-paths and riversides. Woolly thistle is a little bit more selective in its choice of soil and setting, preferring calcareous ground. It too enjoys grasslands. Welted thistle can be found all over the UK, especially loving clay soils. Go prepared! Stiff gloves and a knife are required. Harvest the best leaf mid-ribs in spring when growth is plentiful and quick. Your specimens will be tender and sweeter. Flowering stems will appear from late spring through into autumn. I only consider harvesting from plants whose flower buds are yet to really begin unfurling. Flower buds (chokes) are available all summer. In Portugal, a number of thistle species are still collected in spring and sold at markets. A recent academic study highlighted the nutritional value from eating thistles. The findings are contained within ‘Ethnobotany In The New Europe’ by Manuel. P de Santayana et al. (Eds), published June 2010. In the study, researchers noted the wide range of thistle species collected, and concentrated on the nutritional value of one particular thistle (Scolymus hispanicus – Spanish or golden thistle). This plant is collected by villagers in various areas of the countryside. Bunches of the stripped leaf mid-ribs are sold and bought in a number of markets in different areas. Levels of certain nutrients were analysed and compared to some commonly consumed vegetables. Their findings show that the thistle contained consistently higher levels of important major nutrients than some of our commonly consumed cultivated vegetables. Weight for weight, thistles come out higher in fibre, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc and other nutrients. Is it likely that the thistles found wild here will be similarly endowed with a range of important vitamins and minerals? I’m more than happy to work on the assumption that this will be the case. Many other wild plant species are known to contain high concentrations of important nutrients. Preparing thistles is pretty easy. Simply choose the most tender specimens. If using the petioles, then cut and strip all the spines off, before peeling the outer, fibrous layer from the stalk. Use raw as crudités, pickle or ferment them, or chop into salads and serve them with a tangy vinaigrette. If cooking, they don’t require long! Preparing the stems is similar, but they are hollow. These can be used in similar ways to the petioles, or you can stuff them, roast them, and braise them. As relatives of the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), thistles produce edible, if smaller, ‘chokes’. These are the crunchy, immature bases, or capitulum, of the composite flower-head. As you would do with globe artichokes, peel away the bracts to get to the prize. I only choose the largest wild species for this. Happy foraging!

"Some plants seem to be our constant companions, no matter where we live. Often, they will also be some of our really useful species. It will soon become clear that the common mallow (Malva sylvestris) is one of these plants. Rather than being looked upon as a weed, the mallows can be more usefully described as some of our gloriously abundant plant helpers. A number of mallow species have long been used as a food and medicine, wherever they are found native, and especially in the Middle East and Asia. You won’t have far to go to find the common mallow in most parts of Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia either. Common mallow can be found growing erect or prostrate, which may initially cause confusion because it’s easy to assume they might be two different species. Mallow’s kidney-shaped or palmately-lobed leaves are notably creased, typically with dentate margins. The leaves often show a purple spot in the centre of the base of the leaf and this can also be seen to run down the petiole on some specimens. On other specimens, the purple spotting and colouring is completely absent. Mallow leaves have long petioles. Their deep green foliage hints at a renowned drought tolerance. During flowering, the leaves appear alternately on the stems. Holding a leaf relays the surface coarseness. But tear and crush one, and you discover a family pattern – the mucilage. You will soon experience a slimy and tacky feel between your fingers. All parts of the plant contain mucilage. In bloom, the Malvaceae family plants produce five large notched petals in each open flower. Common mallow has showy pink petals laced with darker-coloured strokes. In the centre of the flower lies a pollen-loaded column of fused stamens. This surrounds the stigma, which rises above the column.  Mallow is known to freely seed. The round seed pods, known as ‘cheeses’, soon follow flowering. These were once munched by children on their way to and from school. The pods are held on stalks, close to the flowering stem. Mallow will be found on most soils, from coastal to marginally upland habitats, with most settings being adequate for this resilient plant. It loves waste-ground as well as grassland; gravel as much as coastal edges, and waysides and roadsides as well as hedges.  Leaves, flowers, seed pods, roots. Leaves, in spring; flowers from late spring; seed pods from early summer. Roots could be harvested from larger rosettes whenever large enough. Medicinal and nutritional constituents Vitamins A,B,C,E; inulin; mucilage; phenols; flavonoids; essential fatty acids; fibre; calcium; magnesium; zinc; selenium; potassium. Traditional and contemporary uses As with many wild food plants, the common mallow has also had a long history of medicinal use. Due to its high mucilage content, mallows make excellent soothing demulcent herbs, especially for cases of inflammation, either for the urinary, digestive or respiratory systems. Pregnant women or new mothers may like to know that mallow leaves can provide useful amounts of iron, as well as being quite high in zinc and most vitamins.  All of the mallow family with exception to the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum), are reportedly edible. With their high mucilage content, the leaves can usefully be taken as an emergency antidote to irritation or burning that may be caused by the accidental consumption of acrid plants in the buttercup family. Creative cooks can substitute mallow for spinach in many dishes, including soups, salads, gnocchi and quiche. I have even flash-fried larger mallow leaves for just one second in hot oil to make ‘popadoms’. Mallow also makes a great addition to soups, whereby the mucilage helps to thicken them.  In Jewish culture, mallow has been been considered the ‘most important plant in local gather society’. Every spring mallow is gathered in the countryside. Its common name in both Hebrew and Arabic, translates to ‘bread’.  During the war of 1948, when Jerusalem was under siege, mallow was an important famine crop, and one that is still celebrated on Independence day every year with a traditional dish made from mallow leaves. Common mallow can be substituted for the family relative Corchorus olitorius aka ‘jutes mallow’, when making the Egyptian / Middle-Eastern dish ‘Molokhia’. This traditional dish is usually served with chicken.  In China, mallow roots are a popular and a common ingredient in making hearty, yet medicinally potent soups and broths. The inulin-rich tap roots of a number of different mallow species, including common mallow, have been used. The seed pods can be substituted for most of the egg white if wanting to make mallow meringues. Simply boil up the peeled seed pods using 3 parts water 1 part seed pods, and reduce the liquid by half. For every half cup of liquid add one egg white, ¼ tsp of cream of tartar, some vanilla and castor sugar, then whip it up until foamy and stiff, just like meringues.  21st Century Foraging  The Medicinal Forest Garden  The Fast Wild Food Cookbookby Johnny Jumbalaya  Amazing Moringa: Medicinal, Edible & Easy to Grow  How to Make your own Sloe Gin Chris Hope, aka Chris Phyto, was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic plant lover, forager and teacher, who sadly died in 2021.";Permaculture Magazine UK

1 red pepper, diced
100g (3.5 oz/2 cups) spinach or chard, chopped
Olive oil
800g (28 oz/5 ⅓ cup) tomatoes, chopped
Plus 2 or 3 tomatoes, sliced, to decorate
240g (8.5 oz/1.5 cups) cooked beans
(400g tin, drained)
1-2 tbsp chopped herbs – basil, parsley or oregano (or a mixture of all three)
Salt and pepper to taste For the garlic bread
A crusty loaf of bread 
4-10 cloves garlic (I like it strong!)
0.5-1 cup olive oil (it depends how large the loaf is)
Pepper
An oven dish approximately 25 x 25cm (10 x 10in) Preheat the oven to 180oC fan (200oC/400oF/gas mark 6). Finely chop the garlic and mix into the olive oil. Add a little pepper, stir and leave to infuse. Slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways into 5mm thick slices. Pour some olive oil into the pan and soften the onions, garlic and celery on a low heat.  When cooked, add the red pepper, beans and tomatoes. Simmer for around 15 minutes until the sauce is cooked through. Meanwhile, drizzle olive oil onto a griddle and cook the aubergines and courgettes, several slices at a time, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Pour some of the tomato sauce into the oven dish, add a layer of aubergine, then more sauce, a layer of courgette, and so on until the dish is filled with layers of sauce, aubergine and courgette. Decorate with slices of tomato. Put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Slice the bread so the knife goes about 90% through the loaf, leaving the base intact and the slices attached to each other. Put in a baking dish and, using a spoon, drizzle the garlic oil over both sides of each slice.  15 minutes before the lasagne is ready, put the bread in the oven. When the lasagne is cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the crusty garlic bread and a large salad, or dish of steamed seasonal green vegetables. Tip – Frying pan will work if you don’t have a griddle. This recipe adapts well to other vegetables. In the winter, use slices of cooked potato, parsnip, sweet potato or squash. Cooked whole cabbage and kale leaves make lovely ‘lasagne sheets’ too.  The Creative Kitchenby Stephanie Hafferty  No Dig Organic Home and Gardenby Stephanie Hafferty and Charles Dowding  Seasonal Pesto and Hummus Recipes  Growing Winter Salads Stephanie Hafferty is a no dig gardener, writer and author of The Creative Kitchen and coauthor of No Dig Organic Home and Garden.";Permaculture Magazine UK
"My name is Suzanne Pendleton and I live in Swinton, Salford (UK) and have been involved in the Greater Manchester Swift Street initiative since August 2024, which has been led by the RSPB. During lockdown I started to value my time outside as so many families did too. I enjoyed time in our little garden more and spotted some birds as they zoomed and screamed over the house. I wasn’t quite sure what they were and asked my friend Kathleen who lived on a surrounding road what they might be. She enlightened me. They were Swifts, a species recently added to the UK’s Red List of birds, meaning they are now amongst our most threatened. Then the summer was over and the swifts left Swinton heading back to Africa.  Each year since, I have eagerly anticipated the return of the Swifts. My understanding grew and I learnt of their declining numbers, now less than 60,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Along with developing a stiff neck constantly looking up to the sky, watching their incredible aerial manoeuvres.  I am privileged to live in a friendly neighbourhood on our lane. The community are always up for helping, and we pull together to help each other. We have a community messaging service which came into its own in lockdown, and continues to be a fabulous way to share information and request help and advice. During the last few years I had messaged our community group and asked if anyone knew about our Swifts and where they were nesting. Initially we were unsuccessful in understanding, but in spring 2024 we struck lucky and finally worked out the eaves where they lived. I’d also discovered Swift Mapper (an app for recording the location of Swift nesting sites) enabling us to understand we had four nest sites on the Lane and surrounding roads.  We also realised that there was another small colony locally less that 1/4 mile away. Last August, a resident of this local road got in touch to say Roshni (Parmar-Hill, Community Engagement Officer) from the RSPB had been to visit their colony. She asked if we’d be interested in getting involved with developing our Swift Street – thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery – and I eagerly accepted the offer. We used our community messaging group to share the news of the Swift Street development and I was overwhelmed by the local response. So many families were keen to help our Swift population, with more than 80 boxes requested. I think the consensus was that we are so privileged that these incredible urban birds choose our lane as their home, and as their nesting places can be threatened by redevelopment, having the opportunity to install boxes is a wonderful chance to do something proactive to help.  Roshni and I visited local homes who had expressed interest, helping families select potential sites for their boxes to be positioned. With Roshni’s guidance we talked about what Swifts need and I and residents began to understand more about how Swifts live. They are remarkably compatible with humans, don’t need a bird bath, bird table etc. as they feed on insects on the wing. I discovered along with other residents that the best way we could help our Swifts was to protect their current nesting sites, add boxes for more birds to nest in and to do all we could to support insect populations. For example, considering planting in our gardens to promote insect life, adopting No Mow May and not using insecticides. Those who weren’t able to install a box could instead help in other ways, so this made the project accessible for all – everyone could join in. Next came the production of the boxes. Roshni contacted local colleges and we were thrilled when a local skills centre suggested their joinery students could make these free of charge. Production began and numbers of those interested had grown as the message about the project spread, and so 100 boxes were produced.  Meanwhile, local guiding groups learnt of the initiative and Roshni visited the groups that I lead, as Brown Owl – 90 girls and young women were keen to learn about Swifts and how they could help. The groups were already keen to learn about environmental matters, and this project really whetted their appetite. The Brownies, Guides and Rangers designed posters, made seed bombs and grew in their understanding of our Swifts. Once the production of the boxes was finished the Brownies, Rangers and Guides got stuck into painting them with an environmentally friendly product which would protect the boxes, and a local lady Haldis (a RSPB Swift Champion, a voluntary role which supports local conservation efforts to protect the species) made the nest cups which would be inserted into each box.  We arrived at installation day on Saturday 8th March, with 25 boxes going up on that first day. By the end of March, 80 had been erected by a local roofer, Ryan. Of course, we needed to celebrate the returning of our precious Swifts and so we began planning our community event. Volunteers came forward from the surrounding roads and we met in a resident’s kitchen each Wednesday, so all could contribute ideas. Other local guiding groups wanted to contribute and so they made nature-themed bunting, and we were thrilled when the church on the lane offered their venue as a space for us to celebrate. The local dance and drama group wanted to be involved and so their leaders and young people planned songs and a drama production with poetry. And as if we weren’t already exciting enough, we then heard the news that RSPB Ambassador Megan McCubbin would love to come along to formally open our Swift Street.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on 17th May, with a fantastic community event. Sixty families made bee hotels, children had Swift-themed face paint, and a plant swap was popular. RSPB provided and led crafts, and local artists supported youngsters to make Swift puppets. More than 300 residents attended and watched the young people perform. The ribbon was cut revealing a beautiful Swift Street banner created by a local artist, alongside Swift boxes 99 and 100 positioned proudly on the front of the church. And yes, we had Swifts soaring high above us all day (perhaps watching the proceedings?) to the delight of the watching children and residents. As the street party continued into the evening we couldn’t believe our eyes when a ‘banger’ (a young Swift, which gets its name from its tendency to bang against prospective nest to check if they’re occupied or not) attempted to enter one of the newly positioned boxes. A perfect end to a fabulous day.  It’s been an absolute honour to be involved in this project and I feel so lucky that our community have been able to do something practical to support our local Swifts.

"We are delighted to announce the recipients of the 2025 Permaculture Magazine Award, in collaboration with Lush Spring Prize. Four projects have been awarded from a fund of £25,000. The Permaculture Magazine Award is a celebration of the vital work of permaculture projects from around the world. The Permaculture Magazine Award was established in 2018 to celebrate the vital work of permaculture projects around the world. To date (May 2025) it has awarded 28 projects with over £155,000. The award has received hundreds of applications, and it is a privilege to highlight this vital regenerative work that is world changing. Coordinating a network of permaculture centres, NGO Permaculture Ukraine offers training, events and educational resources across Ukraine, also ensuring accessibility for internally displaced people (IDP) and former military personnel. The organisation was founded following the first Permaculture Design Course (PDC) in Ukraine in 2011, and has held at least one PDC annually, actively seeking funding to make training accessible to vulnerable groups. Following the full-scale invasion in 2022, its focus expanded to include: The 14 permaculture centres provide training, shelter for IDPs and war-abandoned animals, and rehabilitation for children and adults. Its designers also create communal projects, including schools and homes for disabled people. Despite air raids and blackouts, NGO Permaculture Ukraine successfully hosted a two-day permaculture festival in Kyiv’s botanical garden in September 2024, drawing 100 participants eager to engage with top regenerative practitioners. NGO Permaculture Ukraine empowers Ukrainians for sustainable living and transformative change. Through active social media engagement and collaborations with ecovillages, zero-waste networks, and other ecological movements, it extends its influence and inspires a growing audience to adopt permaculture principles for Ukraine’s regeneration. https://permaculture.in.ua Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Since its founding in 2021, Battmung has: Recognising the importance of connecting people, Battmung also contributed to the founding of the Permaculture Institute of Korea (P.I.K) in 2023. Its goal is to organise its regional network and regenerate South Korea through permaculture, restoring soil, food chains, ecological awareness, and local economies. www.instagram.com/battmung.log Eco Centro Allpa Tarpuna works for the regeneration of degraded lands, food sovereignty and community autonomy, with a focus on indigenous communities in Ecuador. Founded in 2004, it was born out of the return of its founders to their community after experiencing the negative impacts of conventional agriculture and agrochemicals. This return marked the beginning of a path towards reconnecting with indigenous ancestral knowledge and adopting permaculture and organic production. One of the key achievements has been the recovery of soils degraded by monocultures and eucalyptus. Although slow, this process has demonstrated the benefits of a regenerative approach and strengthened the resilience of the community. Allpa Tarpuna is currently focusing on: Allpa Tarpuna integrates bio-construction, renewable energy and sustainable water management into its practices. It also encourages the preservation of ancestral seeds and agro-ecological techniques such as crop rotation, reducing dependence on chemicals. In the future, it wants to expand its training in permaculture design, combining indigenous knowledge with modern regenerative solutions. It seeks to empower more local farmers, promoting designs that restore the connection between people and nature. Allpa Tarpuna is a living indigenous family that sows regeneration, inspiring a sustainable and resilient balance. https://allpatarpuna.org HortaFCUL is a community-based permaculture project based in Lisbon University’s Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). The initiative was launched by a group of biology students concerned about the gap between sustainability ideals and the university’s environmental impact. This bottom-up project has developed an important role as a catalyst of practical scientific-based knowledge. Nowadays, HortaFCUL is a resilient, sustainable and inclusive community, allowing the general public to learn more about nature-based solutions. It has five subprojects at campus level and relies on a volunteer-based horizontally-organised guardians collective to maintain the project’s green areas. HortaFCUL, as a permaculture project, achieves its central goals by closing functional loops related to human activities.

"As politicians wait, grassroots changemakers are restoring ecosystems and rebuilding resilience. They are living examples that regeneration is not just possible, it’s already happening all over the world.  The Lush Spring Prize 2025 is showcasing this work and has awarded around £250,000 to 19 groups, celebrating regenerative organisations and practitioners from around the world. Lead image: Clockwise from top left: Agro-Pueblos (Colombia), Ñu’u Ndito (Mexico), Global Ecovillage Network (Global), Land in Our Names (UK) In a joyous, collaborative and inspiring week of celebrations, the 2025 recipients were honoured as part of a celebratory event held in Dorset (UK), where the Lush Cosmetics company is headquartered. The event was attended by prize recipients, Spring Prize judges, Lush staff, press, funders and other regenerative practitioners. Co-designed with the prize recipients themselves, the event provides a space to connect, co-learn and share stories of regeneration. It offered an opportunity to explore both the diversity of people and organisations that make up the regenerative movement and the common challenges, learnings and successes that unites it. Each Spring Prize year sees different themes emerge that are shaped by the organisations that receive a prize. In 2025, these include the importance of weaving ancestral wisdom with scientific approaches; working at multiple scales and legally recognising the rights of nature, and learning from those on the frontlines that are facilitating regenerative work in conflict zones or regions experiencing natural disasters. In 2025, the backdrop of violence and conflict looms large. Prize recipients from Lebanon and Ukraine are responding to invasions by powerful aggressors, in Myanmar they are working in a context of ongoing internal conflict and many of the Indigenous groups are frequently facing the threat of violence.  The Spring Prize 2025 event allows these groups to come together and share what regenerative work in these situations looks like in a way that may challenge the existing narrative: “In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the biggest achievement for our organisation is to continue our activities and find ways to be useful for Ukrainian society like creating permaculture public spaces and rehabilitating people in our demonstration centers. The war has taught us that strength is in unity and networks, that autonomous homesteads and farms that grow their own food and preserve their seeds can not only survive but also help other people, and that international support and networks matter.” NGO Permaculture in Ukraine While humanity witnesses declining biodiversity, climate catastrophes and widespread conflict, these organisations highlight how regenerative practices are not just a source of hope but a necessary and much needed response.

Examples of this year’s awarded projects include: Aguaje palm tree seedlings were distributed among Kukama families in Parinari, Loreto, Peru, as part of the reforestation and conservation initiative led by Huaynakana. Extractivism represents a constant threat to the Kukama territory in Peru and the loss of the Kukama peoples’ cultural identity. Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana exists to protect this. The Kukama people conceive of the territory as a whole and women having an intrinsic connection to it. The term ‘kukama’ for example is composed of two words: ‘ku’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘kama’ meaning ‘bosom,’ and it signifies ‘field-bosom’ or ‘nourished by the field.’ Given the Kukama peoples’ lives are reliant on the forest ecosystems of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and considering how they have adapted and coexisted with them for decades, the territory and the rivers are inseparable from their culture and way of life. They consider the rivers to be living beings with spirits, and therefore sacred. Founded in 2001, Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana embarked on a long journey of collective actions, protests, and mobilisations in pursuit of environmental justice as the river’s health declined as a result of extractive industries. In September 2021 Huaynakana filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognise the Marañón River as a living being and subject of rights. In March 2024, the provincial court of Nauta ruled that the Marañón River has intrinsic rights, including the right to flow, to be free from pollution, and to be restored to environmental health. This decision also recognised Indigenous communities as the river’s legal representatives, defenders, and guardians. This landmark ruling was ratified by the higher court last November. Huaynakana plays a key role in defending the Marañón’s rights and supporting the regeneration and conservation of the waterways through reforestation efforts because without the river, these unique forests cannot exist. Mushrooms harvested from the Ubuntu food forest Ubuntu Learning Hub Trust was set up in 2022 with a mission to support people who are in transition towards more resilient futures and a healthier planet. The Trust immediately began to set up the Ubuntu Learning Centre as an open learning space for all ages as well as a demonstration centre for integrating technologies that are in tune with a healthy Mother Earth. The learning centre sits on a two-hectare site in Chikancila village in Chongwe district of Lusaka Province of Zambia. It is founded on the African philosophy of Ubuntu which helps people to learn what it means to be truly human. It hosts people from all walks of life who are looking for pathways to escape the rat race and curve more sustainable futures for themselves, their families and the communities where they come from. The Trust uses agro-ecological practices to regenerate the degraded farmland that was damaged over decades of poor land husbandry. For example, the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) technique has helped to restore much of the indigenous vegetation on the land. People come to Ubuntu to explore the meaning of life and to find their life purpose. They stay at Ubuntu for varying lengths of time and in the process they are engaged in intercultural exchanges as well as learning how to take care of themselves and of Mother Earth. The Trust offers life changing experiences rather than certificates and the opportunity to carve out an earth-centred worldview for themselves.

Harvesting with Battmung friends The LUSH Spring Prize is a joint venture between LUSH Cosmetics and Ethical Consumer and is now in its sixth prize cycle, having started in 2017. The Spring Prize has distributed more than £1.3 million to regenerative projects worldwide. The LUSH Spring Prize was set up to support ‘regenerative’ projects – those that go beyond sustainability by taking holistic approaches to building the health of ecology, economy and social systems. It seeks to support those who are leaving the world lusher than they found it, and are actively restoring all the systems they are part of. By supporting regenerative projects the Spring Prize hopes to raise the profile of the movement as a whole to inspire more individuals, groups, communities, funders, media platforms and businesses to start engaging with regenerative processes.  The Spring Prize judging panels are made up of people drawn from a diverse range of movements that represent regenerative design, permaculture, food sovereignty, transition towns, biomimicry, eco-village networks and various social justice movements. Each prize cycle a ‘Lush Customer Judge’ and ‘Lush Staff Judge’ are also selected to act as additional independent members of the judging panel.  The collaborative prizes have separate panels, which also include judges from the main Spring Prize panel. The majority of the judging panel for the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Award self identify as Indigenous themselves, some being previous recipients of the award. The judges are not just involved in choosing the recipients but are involved in shaping the prize as a whole, attending the event and connecting with prize recipients. You can read more about the judges here: Spring Prize Judging Panel.

"Around 40 years ago, the Sahel, an extremely arid region located in central Africa, was an area of agricultural desolation. Due to natural factors such as heavy drought and interannual variability, combined with anthropocentric influences like climate change, overgrazing and deforestation, the environment has become particularly unstable with little possibility for productivity.  Furthermore, when rain does fall in the arid region, the soil is so dry due to a lack of precipitation, that water immediately ‘runs off’ or evaporates, failing to soak into the depleted earth. Some countries within the region, such as Burkina Faso, faced up to 24% of their arable lands classed as highly degraded in 1998 (Maatman et al., 1998).  In the early 2000s, NGOs and organisations such as the United Nations, the World Food Programme and WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), amongst others, sought to reverse the desertification of many parts of Africa, including the Sahel, in cooperation with farmers and communities from the affected regions. Using the ancient ‘half moon’ water harvesting technique – used for centuries in Africa and the Middle East, the revitalised technique aims to facilitate water retention and re-green the ecosystem. Heavy machinery or hand tools can be used to plough the soil roughly 30cm down in a semi-circle or ‘half moon’ shape. The diameter of these half moons are typically about 4 metres. When it rains, the contours catch the rainwater, preventing runoff and allowing it to infiltrate the soil. This creates ‘favourable micro-climate conditions’ allowing drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet to be planted.  If planted on steep slopes, half-moon ‘bunds’ can assist the growth of tree species. They can also be used in combination with controlled grazing to boost re-vegetation. In Niger, The World Food Programme (WFP) has been implementing half-moon planting projects since 2014. Just 5 years into the scheme, the benefits of its implementation were examined by a progress-review. In 2019, over 400 households had restored approximately 3,000 acres of land, largely for use in producing food for livestock. This has promoted social cohesion and economic growth by providing more jobs and stabilising agricultural output in a formerly capricious climate. This scenario exhibits the benefits of a localised, small-scale regenerative farming technique such as half-moon planting through its trickle-down effects, stipulating broader socio-economic growth. A study on the impact of reformed agroecological techniques was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Burkina Faso. Figures revealed that fields ploughed using the half-moon method saw the rates of increase for grain yield at 8% (The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 2017). As farmers sought new ways to boost crop yields, regenerative farming techniques such as the half-moon method were found to be successful when used in conjunction with others. In Burkina Faso, half-moon planting is exercised alongside the Zaï technique, which is useful when adapting to various soil types and structures. The Zaï method, suitable to the arid Sahel region, uses similar methods seen in the half-moons, but alternatively involves digging smaller pits in non-permeable soil to intercept water and gather compost material. These pits are slightly smaller than the half-moons and so are less labour intensive and can be utilised in smaller growing plots. They are roughly between 15-50cm across; 5-15cm deep; and positioned 80cm apart. This technique was reintroduced to the area in the 1980s by farmer and agronomist Yacouba Sawadogo, who pioneered the method of filling the holes with manure to further break up the earth and bolster soil productivity.

"Traditional Māori time systems were measured in accordance to the night as opposed to the Western proxy of daylight. Each night of the lunar month had a particular name and this cumulatively formed a lunar calendar known as ‘Maramataka‘. Farming according to the Maramataka lunar calendar is used in conjunction with Māori regenerative farming techniques to adapt to nature’s schedule as opposed to imposing controls on the earth’s processes. Many farmers are now seeking to turn back to these ancient methods in line with broader sustainability imperatives. Under the Maramataka calendar, individual lunar nights were marked according to how optimal they were for catching fish, eels or planting crops, with each night having its own name. A good example is eel fishing. It is not productive on a full moon – Rākaunui – because the moon’s light would not allow eel to hunt their prey, as the prey could see them. As with biodynamics (the Rudolf Steiner lunar approach for farming), planting crops is nest at a full moon, when the gravitational pull is at its highest, because it has maximum influence on water in the soil. “Despite the use of Maramataka being limited to a relative few today, largely because of colonisation, interest in and revival of this knowledge and practice is growing.”1 Many farmers are returning to the use of farming tactics such as Maramataka planting in line with broader regenerative goals. The Revitalise Te Taiao programme aims to fund sustainable and lucrative agribusiness solutions to cultivate Te Taiao (the natural world). This project provided $2.7 million in funding to Miru Young and Mohi Beckham, farmers based in the North Island’s Bay of Plenty, to trial agriculture techniques which aim to “enhance the mana and mauri of the soil” across 10 farm sites. As part of the scheme, both farmers undertook rigorous research, sowing pasture throughout different moon phases from resting and dormant phases to high-energy phases for plant growth. Soon, grass seeds sown during the high energy periods of the Maramataka calendar outgrew neighbouring crops planted in other phases, even if the latter had been sown 10 days before. Despite still being in the trial stages of Maramataka planting, Miru and Mohi observed various positive impacts of the scheme within the first few months. Their land has seen higher productivity and crop yields, with a 93% crop survival rate under Maramataka planting, that is an increase of 13% from the usual 80% under previous methods. One of the main issues associated with returning to traditional farming methods on a broader scale is competing with intensive methods in New Zealand’s modern agricultural industry. After settlers from the West arrived in New Zealand during the 18th and 19th centuries, intensive farming practices quickly became widespread.  As farming in the country has continuously expanded into the modern day, with agricultural exports making up a large proportion of the country’s GDP, traditional farming methods have become far less lucrative in the broader market. This meant that Māori farmers had to adopt newer techniques, as those trying to maintain the traditional methods were faced with far lower crop yields and income. Rural management programmes and sustainability objectives are constantly investigating new and feasible ways to rejuvenate te ao Māori farming techniques, with the Revitalise Te Taiao programme representing just one of many schemes. The Maramataka lunar calendar is part of a broader Maori worldview known as Mātauranga Māori – a term used to describe the collective knowledge of Māori living in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the knowledge passed down from their ancestors. Kaitiakitanga (stewardship/management) and the link between Whakapapa (Māori genealogy/ancestral descent) and Whenua (land) are key areas of te ao Māori and Mātauranga values.  By embracing schools of thought that are native to Aotearoa, alongside promoting equitable stewardship across modern farming methodologies, high agricultural output can be attained. Reforming the agribusiness in New Zealand will involve reintegrating Māori into decision making processes, embracing cross-cultural thought processes and utilising western technological advancements for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.

"Lammas is a celebration of the summer and the gathering in of the grain harvest. This was especially significant in the past. After all the hard work of getting the grain crop cut, threshed, stored and stacked, there came a time for feasting, celebration and assessment. Lammas is a Saxon name meaning ‘Loaf-mass’. Lughnasadh (pronounced Loo-nas-ah) is Irish Gaelic. On Lammas Eve fires were lit on Lammas mounds such as Silbury Hill at Avebury, to honour the Corn Mother as she gives birth to her harvest child, the Grain. This is the seed that will bring next year’s harvest as well as the grain that will sustain life throughout the winter. The month of August was the month of the Grain Mother. An ‘augur’ is an old word for seer and meant ‘increaser’. The great abundance of the Earth Mother is reflected in the titles she was given at this time: The Grain Mother, Barley Mother, Corn Mother, Demeter, Ceres, Cerealia, Grain, the Wise One of the Earth, the Increaser, She who is the seed, who is the womb, who is the soil, the Great Provider, the Preserver of Life. Cutting the ‘corn’ seems to be a general term for all cereal crops, whether they are wheat, barley, rye or oats. There were many customs and rituals throughout Europe to honour the first and the last sheaf of corn to be cut. The last sheaf was often cut by the youngest girl present and fashioned into a Corn Maiden. It was carried joyfully back to the village, sometimes plaited and decked with ribbons, and usually hung over the fireplace. Sometimes it was dressed in women’s clothes, and ritually burnt on the Lammas Fire. Sometimes these Corn Maidens were kept until Yule when they were divided up amongst the cattle or kept until the spring. Sometimes they were kept with the date tied to them. Many Corn Maidens would be seen hanging above the fireplace. In Scotland the ‘young maid’ was made out of the last stalks cut, and kept. The ‘old wife’ was made out of the first stalks cut and was passed on to the nearest farm that had not finished bringing in the corn. This was then passed round until it ended up at the last farm to be cut. Another old European custom was to weave the last sheaf into a large Corn Mother with a smaller corn doll inside it, representing next year’s unborn harvest. The regenerative power of the Earth is never more manifest than now as the grain harvest is gathered in and the Sun’s cycle begins to wane. The Cauldron of Regeneration was central to Celtic spiritual understanding. We are renewed by sleep and darkness, through many deaths and rebirths, and by the sacrifice of our outer lives for the inner journey. Here at Lammas, the doorway to the inner realms is opening. This is the symbolism behind the Demeter/Kore/Persephone story. Demeter, the Corn Mother, represents the ripe corn of this year’s harvest, and Kore or Persephone represents the grain-seed who lives in the dark throughout the winter and reappears in the Spring. Persephone’s descent into the Underworld is a mythical interpretation of the seed lying in the ground during the dark winter months, and her reappearance as the young maid, or the new sprouting seed, in the spring. This story shows us the Triple Goddess in all her aspects: as Earth Mother, the abundant provider; as the Crone, the wisdom found within; and as the Maiden who returns renewed in the spring. Pluto/Hades’ abduction of Persephone is a later reworking of this older myth. After all the manifest energy and activity of the early summer, it is good to make time now to rest and to assimilate all that has happened during the Sun’s active phase. Lammas celebrations would probably have begun with the cutting of the last sheaf of corn. Although the 2nd of August is the calendar date for Lammas, the great Lammas fairs and feasts would probably have lasted from mid July to mid August and would have peaked around the time of the harvest Full Moon. Once the grain had been safely gathered in and the men returned from their hunting trips, it was a time for feasting, dancing and merry-making, a great celebration of the first of the harvest and assessment of the year’s achievements. Beer, wine, cider and whisky made from the previous year’s harvest, were ritually drunk, celebrating the transformative power of Fire and Water. Cooking fires were honoured as they too embodied the power of Fire and Water. Bread was made from the new grain and thanks were given to the Sun’s life energy reborn as the bread of life. This is a busy time for harvesting herbs and collecting herb seeds to sow in the spring. Give thanks and blessings as you pick them, dry them and store them. Review what you know about them and ways you can use them both physically and metaphysically. Harvest sage at the end of July, before the flowers have come out. Sage is a herb associated with wisdom and releasing blocks in expression. It is connected to the throat chakra and is for those who have something to say but cannot let it out. It will help you express your emotions. Make the herb tea in the usual way. The infusion is a useful antiseptic herb for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers and mouth infections. It can be used as a gargle, for bathing wounds, sores, and to stop bleeding. Use the tea infusion externally and then drink afterwards as well. It will dry up excess secretions such as catarrh or sinusitis. It contains oestrogen and is useful in the menopause and for delayed menstruation. Burn dried sage to cleanse and purify. Waft the smoke around a person to cleanse their aura (called smudging). This is a good way to begin any ritual or ceremony. N.B. It must not be taken if pregnant, and because of its drying action, it must not be taken for long periods of time. It will dry up mother’s milk. Care must be taken by those who are insulin-dependent, and to be avoided by epileptics. Garlands of meadowsweet were traditionally worn for the Lammas celebrations. Its heady perfume expands the psyche, and builds inner strength. It enhances flexibility and connection to the inner levels. It is a mild sedative and painkiller containing salicylic acid (aspirin) that affects the rate at which blood clots. It is a good digestive tonic that reduces excess acidity and is useful for heartburn, hyperacidity, gastritis and peptic ulcers. As it cleanses the body of harmful acids, it is useful for any inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is a strong diuretic (increases urine) and can be used for any bladder or kidney complaint including cystitis. It reduces stagnation in the liver and therefore will help the immune system function more effectively. Its harvest time is July and August when the flowers are just beginning to open. Collect them in brown paper bags to dry for later use. N.B. Avoid if on anti-coagulant drugs. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Sacred Earth Celebrations, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"There are various methods for drying herbs for herbal recipes but they all require that the herb is dried and stored out of the light. I prefer to use brown paper bags, other people hang them up in bunches or lay them between sheets of newspaper or brown paper. • If using brown paper bags always label the bags with the name of the herb, the date and where you picked it. This is good practice and a good habit to get into as plants can change a lot in the drying process. Even if you think you will know what it is, it is surprising how you can forget, especially if you bag up several herbs over a period of a few weeks. • Leave the bags in a dry warm environment for several weeks. Put them in the airing cupboard if you have one, hang over the wood-burner or leave them on top of radiators. Shake the bags and turn the leaves over with your hands every day or two. It is essential to do this to stop any mould getting in to the herbs while they are still drying. • The herbal properties of leaves and flowers will deteriorate after 1 year so they need to be re-collected every year. Fruit, seeds, berries, roots and bark will last for 2 years. It is light that destroys the herbal properties of herbs, so at its simplest herbs can be stored all year in brown paper bags, although if they are kept in the kitchen they will need to be kept in a plastic container or airtight tin to keep them dry. Keeping the herbs in a dedicated leather or cotton bag is the traditional medicine way and these are hung somewhere warm and dry, near a radiator or fire. Putting them into dark glass jars is good in a kitchen because of the condensation. Clear jam jars are fine if they are kept in a dark cupboard. At its simplest the jar can be kept in a brown paper bag or more creative ways can be found. Herb teas vary in taste and quality. Buying popular blends as tea bags is convenient, but be aware that the herbs may be old by the time you drink them, and the herbs may have been grown in monocultures and sprayed with petrochemicals. It is infinitely better to make your own. • Making herb teas is not an exact science, especially when using the common safe plants. Interestingly, different herbalists use different amounts. I use about a teaspoonful of dried herbs or a small pile that fits into the hollow of my palm, and between a half to a pint of water, depending on the need. Use less for young children and anyone who is weak and frail. Dried herbs have twice the strength of fresh herbs, so twice the amount of fresh herb is used. • As you make the tea, say thank you to the plant. This open-hearted attitude adds to the healing process. I like to picture the plant and affirm its healing qualities as I wait for the tea to brew, partly to affirm the healing I am engaged in and also as a memory aid. This way I keep learning and understanding more about the plants all the time and keep my knowledge strong. Many of the herbs are an acquired taste. Nurture an openness to these wild flavours and earthy tastes and give them a chance. More often than not, a taste you didn’t like at first becomes a taste that you find you love. These are also for adults only as they are a mixture of brandy and honey. This makes them a most delicious way to take your medicine! They are especially good to use when travelling as they are kept in small dropper bottles and taken neat. Elixirs are combination remedies, created for specific uses and personal needs. Elixirs need to taste good so the addition of any aromatic herbs improves the flavour, but must also support the over-all herbal action. They are experimental and fun, as well as being extremely effective and I like to give them creative names. Write up everything in your Herb Journal. This is especially important when you make combination elixirs. Recording the plants and proportions used is invaluable when you create something you want to repeat. Method one 1. Half fill a dark jar with a herb or combinations of herbs: tear the leaves, crush the seeds or fruit, and chop the roots. Send your thanks to the plants. Add a little of something that will give it a nice flavour such as rose petals, sweet violet, lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena etc, making sure that their actions support the overall use of the remedy. 2. Cover the plant matter with clear runny honey and send your silent thanks to the bees. Poke well with a chopstick to get out any trapped air bubbles and break the plant matter up further. 3. Then top the jar up with brandy and 4. Put on the lid and label, date and shake well. Give it a poke and a shake frequently and keep out of bright light. They are ready in about a month, although they come to no harm if they are left longer. 5. Strain off the plant matter and rebottle in clean dark dropper bottles. Pour a little boiling water over the mash of herbs that are left over, getting every last bit of goodness out of them. Toast the plant and its medicine and have your first taste before returning the spent mash to the earth with thanks. Method two Create an instant elixir using the tinctures you have made. 1. Using a jug combine several tinctures that support the remedy you are making. 2. Mix in a similar amount of honey to tincture and mix the two together. 3. Pour into dark dropper bottles. Name and date and write up in your herb journal. Their dosage is similar to tinctures, although I tend to use them little and often. Here are some suggestions of plants to choose from, depending on what you have available. I have listed the native plants first and the aromatics at the end. Anti-stress elixir Hawthorn, cowslip, vervain, rose petals, lavender, borage. Drops of calm Hawthorn, elderflowers, cowslip, hops, valerian, vervain, rose petals, borage, lavender, chamomile. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Letting in the Wild Edges, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"Growing my own mulch has long been a goal of mine. We use a lot of mulch in the nursery and garden and at the moment I have no problem sourcing straw but if/when the day comes that the farmers start using their own straw to improve their soil (which is becoming a more common practice), I’ll be needing to step up my mulch growing efforts. Currently, I grow enough mulch to sustain my perennial beds and around 10% of my annual beds but rely on imported straw for mulching the other 90% of annual vegetable and nursery beds. My ideal mulch plant grows fast, is drought tolerant, competes minimally with crop plants, does not contain seed that easily spreads, is easy to handle and cut, i.e. not thorny/prickly or tough and fibrous, and can biodegrade relatively quickly (thereby returning the nutrients back to soil). I’ve broadly categorized the main sources of mulch we produce in our 1500m2 garden. Aquatic plants
I grow emergent wetland species such us cattails (Typha spp), sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) on the banks of a small pond (6m x 3m), and within a grey water reed bed (1m x 6m). The pond also provides suitable habitat for hornworts (Ceratophyllum spp). a submerged rootless perennial that gathers on the surface en masse. This plant makes an excellent mulch being rich in nitrogen, growing very fast and is easy to position around the base of plants. The emergent species provide a good thick carbon rich mulch that helps to reduce evaporation on the terrestrial beds and I cut these back in the spring in case they are used for overwintering invertebrates. Aquatic plants are an excellent source of mulch as there are no issues with seed germinating amongst your land based crops. Tap rooted perennial / biennials
Deep rooted perennial plants tend to produce a good amount of biomass, are generally drought tolerant and do not compete strongly with our crop plants. I have found native biennial weeds such as greater burdock (Arctium lappa), a very useful mulch plant with the gigantic leaves growing back very fast after a cut. Lesser burdock (Arctium minus), is also useful albeit to lesser extent. Although biennial, if you cut back these plants before flowering you can prolong their life, harvesting good quantities of seed free biomass. I do eventually allow some of the plants to flower and they are much loved by bees among other insects. Comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum), ‘bocking 14’, is a classic example of a deep rooted mulch plant. We have the plant scattered throughout the garden and planted in dedicated patches. The plants do require irrigation however and will only provide good leaf yields if grown on fertile soil. Peeing on the plants is recommended. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), provide a great source of biomass. For a good tuber harvest it’s best to wait until the end of the season before harvesting the mulch. We can never consume as much as we produce of these tubers in the kitchen. I have found them to be much appreciated by our pigs and an excellent source of fresh winter food for our rabbits. Leaves of greater burdock (Arctium lappa) Nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs 
These plants take a while to establish but make an excellent contribution. I’ve had good results from coppicing empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), when they are 3-years-old and chop and dropping the soft new growth three or four times a year. I am expecting to also see good results from grey alder (Alnus incana) and Italian alder (Alnus cordata). I avoid using thorny nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs for this purpose. Annual trimming of shrubs such as autumn olive – Elaeagnus umbellata and broom – Cytisus scoparius also provides good quantities of mulch. Click here for more info on nitrogen fixing plants. Lawn and ground cover
One of my favourite sources of mulch is lawn trimmings. They are great for mulching potted plants or applying a mulch into tight spots. Mixed species lawns will contain a more diverse mix of mineral nutrients. Lawns including a legume such as white clover (Trifolim repens), can provide a nitrogen rich mulch. It’s a good idea to leave some of the trimmings behind to keep the lawn healthy. Autumn leaf fall and herbaceous stem residue
The annual shedding of leaves from trees and shrubs in our garden make a great contribution to our mulch capital. Leaves can be cleared from paths, lawns and wildflower beds (as they will disrupt the growth in these areas) and concentrated where they are of benefit such as the base of high demanding fruiting shrubs such as blackcurrants or blackberries. Herbaceous perennials such as lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis) and mints (Mentha spp). will provide dead stems annually. It’s always a good idea to leave hollow stems of some herbaceous perennials to remain for the winter as they are utilized by invertebrates for egg laying and hibernating. If the plant does not have a hollow stem it can be cut back and used for mulch. Fennel (Foeniculm vulgare), provides large quantities of biomass and as far as I can tell the stems are not utilised by any organism over the winter. In the vegetable garden all the remnants of my crops after harvesting go straight back to the surface for recycling. Foeniculum vulgare and other herbaceous perennials Tree prunings
Woody prunings from shrubs, trees and vines cut into small pieces (5-10cm) make good mulch in the mature areas of the forest garden with well established fungal soils specializing in breaking down the lignified woody material. Living mulches 
In the more mature areas of the garden where the trees have established (5yrs and older) I have dispensed with mulch all together in favour of ground cover plants that can be considered living mulches. Some the most successful perennial living mulches I have found that form good dense cover in the shade include bugle (Ajuga reptans), spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), Caucasian stonecrop (Sedem spurium), perwinkle (Vinca major) and betony (Stachys officinalis). Lamium maculatum spreading well under a mullbery (Morus alba) Scaling up mulch production
In order to grow enough mulch to provide a water retaining, weed excluding barrier for my annual and nursery beds I would certainly need more space. A larger wetland area would be ideal, with aquatic species growing very fast and the seed bearing parts of the plants being non problematic to use on terrestrial beds. If you don’t have a reliable aquatic habitat, the next best option for growing quantities of mulch without irrigation and fertilization is probably grass. During my next post I’ll be sharing a plan where using the lessons garnered from small scale systems, we’ll be growing mulch to support approx 670 fruit trees and 1360 soft fruit shrubs on a 5ha Agroforestry Project (design layout below).

"There are many medicinal uses for elder – Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae family). It is an evocative tree, steeped in history, tradition, and folklore. This is one of our great food and medicinal plants, easily found in most areas of the British Isles where people have settled. It’s botanical name, Sambucus nigra, stems from the Greek word sambuke; a ‘musical pipe’, due to its hollow form supplying our ancestors a perfect wood for making pipes. The Latin ‘nigra’, means black, in allusion to the dark colour of ripe elder berry fruit. Elder is a deciduous woodland and hedgerow plant, native to Northern Europe and North America, and can be seen happily growing on most types of soil up to altitudes of approximately 470m. Superstition says to not cut elder down or burn them. This may be purely because of the toxic fumes which rise from burning elder wood, or it may be that the faeries will be really upset because you are destroying such a useful plant! Other legends have grown around this plant, such as that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who allegedly betrayed Jesus to the Romans, then said to have hanged himself from its branches. This story gave rise to the name of the edible fungus found all year round on the elder – the Jelly Ear. Elder can sometimes be found growing as a shrubby form, and sometimes like a tree on a single trunk, similar to other woodland-edge plants like hazel, hawthorn and blackthorn. A mature elder typically displays a domed crown, and will be spotted from a distance once you know it. Elders can reach 8m or more, although more commonly 5-6m or so, because of other limiting environmental factors. Ideally the plant likes a rich and damp soil in a sunny position. Elder does not like exposed sites or windy hillsides. The branches display numerous lenticels (air holes) and produce their stems with opposite pairs of buds. The buds are naked, without bud scales. The light brown, corky bark pattern on elder can appear quite similar to the invasive exotic, the ‘butterfly bush’ – Buddleja davidii. The similarity between Sambucus and Buddleja ends there. Elder’s leaves are completely different in form. They are compound, comprising of seven oval, serrated leaflets, each being about 7-10cm long. The leaflets typically come in two or three opposite pairs with one terminal leaflet. They are a much lighter green colour than the Himalayan native ‘butterfly bush’ which has a simple, lanceolate / elliptical leaf. You will find this year’s flowers and fruits on last year’s growth. The umbel-like elderflowers, (technically corymbs), are borne on terminal stems. Five creamy-white petals surround the yellow anthers. When ripe, and picked on a sunny day, are bursting with pollen and scent, and should be a bright lemon-yellow. They turn brown when past their best. Only pick ripe flowers! The flowers have a small amount of natural yeast on them which assists fermentation when making drinks. This will be testified by anyone who makes the superb thirst quenching elderflower champagne! The rank smell of elder leaves or the gone-over flowers is known to repel many who come across it, often being described as a cat urine smell!  After a short but sweet period in full bloom, the flowers give rise to upstanding clusters of small berries, which are typically no bigger than 10mm in diameter. Initially green, the berries gradually begin to nod earthwards as they ripen. At the end of the summer they are dark purple – with many medicinal uses. Parts used Flowers, berries, leaves, bark, fungi. Harvest time The flowers are picked when in full bloom. The berries are picked when ripe in the autumn. Key active medicinal constituents Tannins, potassium, mucilage, phenols, triterpenes, sterols, lectins, flavonoids (including rutin). The dark coloured berries are rich in anthocyanins, folic acid and vitamins A and C. They also contain flavonoids, and cyanidin glucosides, which are poisonous in large doses.  Medicinal actions Diaphoretic, febrifuge, anti-catarrhal, anti viral, immuno-supportive. Uses – Elderflowers and berries are expectorant and diaphoretic, thus they help to manage and reduce fevers and to rid the body of toxins. – Elderflowers are also anti-viral and are useful in combating herpes simplex type 1 virus (responsible for cold sores). – The flowers can be made into champagne, cordials, wine, sorbet, jam and fritters. – Elderberry extract has been proven to inhibit various strains of flu, especially if taken early enough. Many people can testify that elder can significantly reduce recovery times from influenza. – Some books have stated the ripe berries are poisonous, but this is slightly misleading. They will cause gastric upset if you eat a large quantity raw, (as will too many apples while scrumping) but in small amounts they should present no problem. Cooked into jams, syrups etc., larger quantities of elderberries are absolutely fine. – Pioneering contemporary forager-chefs have rediscovered that even the green berries can be used, as ‘capers’, if prepared correctly. This involves fermenting the berries in a salt brine solution for a few days, similar to preparing green walnuts for pickling, and then covering in a flavoured vinegar. – Even when the tree is dormant in the winter, it is still possible to harvest food! The ‘Jelly ear’ fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is often found on elder, dead or alive. Known as a delicacy in China, it is best cooked sliced into thin strips, in a spicy, oriental-style soup.

"There’s a plethora of info out there about comfrey but not much detail regarding establishing and managing a comfrey patch so I thought I would write an article to share my experience on this and how we grow comfrey as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden. A member of the borage family, comfrey – Symphytum spp. is native to Europe and Asia and there are 40 recorded species throughout that region. The plant most commonly referred to and used in gardens is Russian comfrey – Symphytum x uplandicum, a naturally occurring hybrid of two wild species: common comfrey – Symphytum officinale and prickly comfrey – Symphytum asperum. A few centuries back, the hybrid Symphytum x uplandicum came to the attention of Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) and he widely promoted the plant as a food and forage crop. Years later, and after two world wars, Lawrence D Hills (1911-1991) would continue Henry Doubleday’s Comfrey crusade. In the 1950s, Hills developed a comfrey research program in the village of Bocking, near Braintree in the UK. The original trial site is on the plot of land now occupied by the Doubleday Gardens housing development. Lawrence Hills lived at 20 Convent Lane just around the corner of the trial site. At this site, Hills trialed at least 21 comfrey ‘strains’, each one named after the village Bocking. Strain 14 was identified as being the most nutrient rich, non-seeding strain and ‘Bocking 14’ began its journey into gardens far and wide across the world. (Learn more its history on the Balkan Ecology Project blog.) Medicinal – Comfrey has been cultivated as a healing herb since at least 400BC. The Greeks and Romans commonly used comfrey to stop heavy bleeding, treat bronchial problems and heal wounds and broken bones. Poultices were made for external wounds and tea was consumed for internal ailments. Comfrey has been reported to promote healthy skin with its mucilage content that moisturizes and soothes and promotes cell proliferation. This plant is my first port of call if ever I need to dress a wound. Simply take a few leaves brush them together to remove the hairs and wrap them around the wound and apply light pressure. It’s incredibly effective at stopping the bleeding, reducing the pain and healing the wound. Biomas – Comfrey produces large amounts of foliage from late May (late spring) until hard frosts in October or November (late autumn). The plant is excellent for producing mulch and can be cut from 2-5 times per year depending on how well the plants are watered and fed. The plant grows rapidly after each harvest. In our gardens we have Comfrey ‘Bocking 14’ located next to each fruit tree in order to have a renewable source of mulch just where we need it. We also grow in patches as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden and have patches in the wildflower meadows (details below). We’ve supplied 1,000 ‘Bocking 14’ cuttings to Oxygenisis, a business in Germany who are experimenting with using this plant for carbon capture. Mineral dam – Comfrey has deep roots of up to 2m that utilize nutrients deep in the subsoil that would otherwise wash away with the underground soil water or remain inaccessible to other plants. The nutrients, once taken up from the roots, are relocated throughout the plant as and where needed with some of them ending up in the comfrey leaf mass. When cutting the leaf mass and applying to the soil surface, the mined nutrients are returned and again made accessible to shallower rooted crop plants.  Biodiversity – The bell shaped flowers provide nectar and pollen to many species of bees and other insects from late May until the first frosts in late autumn. Lacewings are said to lay eggs on comfrey and spiders overwinter on the plant. Parasitoid wasps and spiders will hunt on and around comfrey. Pest and disease prevention and control – Research indicates that a comfrey solution can be used to prevent powdery mildew. Pest predators such as spiders, lacewings and parasatoid wasps associate with this plant. It’s best to leave some plants alone in order to sustain pest predator relationships. Ground cover – Some species can quickly spread to form a thick ground cover and work particularly well for ground cover on the sunny side under shrubs and trees. Symphytum tuberosum – Tuberous Comfrey seems to be the best species for this.  Fertilizer – Comfrey leaves contain a great balance of major plant nutrients (N,P,K) and can be fed to plants as powder, direct mulch or by steeping chopped comfrey leaves in water for several weeks to produce a thick, dark liquid that can be diluted with water and applied to plant roots. More on this below. Nutritional value of comfrey – You can see from the below table that wilted comfrey contains significantly higher quantities of potash compared to other organic fertilizers. It’s well recorded that comfrey is an excellent source of potassium (K) a major plant nutrient that is required by plants in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction. Animal fodder – Comfrey has a long history for use as an animal feed. Lawrence D Hills dedicated books to this topic.* The leaves are best received by animals wilted. Fresh leaves can be eaten by pigs, sheep, and poultry but cattle, rabbits and horses will only consume wilted leaves. Human consumption – Symphytum officianale and Symphytum x uplandicum are both reported to be used for salad and potherb and are best when cooked. Personally I’m not keen on the texture but will have the occasional nibble from the garden using the new growth to mix in a spring green salad. Caution – Although comfrey has been used as a food crop, in the past 20 years scientific studies reported that comfrey may be carcinogenic, since it appeared to cause liver damage and cancerous tumors in rats. These reports have temporarily restricted development of comfrey as a food crop. In light of this, the regular consumption of comfrey is not advisable.  Life cycle – Herbaceous perennial Growth habit – Comfrey begins growth in early-April and by early May compact clusters of young leaves are visible in the crown of the old plant. Within a few weeks, the leaf blades with long petioles have grown to over 35cm high. Basal leaves are large, lance-shaped, stalked, and coarsely hairy. The leaves die back following the first frost and remain dormant for winter. Many species can spread vigorously via seed and are generally not welcome in the garden because of this. Other species can spread via tubers and all species quickly regenerate from broken root pieces.  Flowering – Starts in late May or early June and continues until the first frost in late autumn. The bell-shaped flowers with pedicels are in terminal cymes or one-sided clusters. Flowers of common comfrey are usually creamy yellow, but white, red, or purple types have been found in Europe. Prickly comfrey has pink and blue flowers while Russian comfrey has blue, purple, or red-purple flowers. Tuberous comfrey has creamy white flowers. Vegetative growth does not cease with the start of flowering, and the plant will add new stems continuously during the growing season. Most comfrey plants can be somewhat invasive, spreading via seed to parts of the garden where they are not wanted. ‘Bocking 14’ will flower and provide nectar and pollen but will not produce viable seed. Roots – Some species have short, thick, tuberous roots such as Symphytum tuberosum. Others such as Symphytum x uplandicum have deep and expansive root systems. Light – Needs full sun for good biomass production but grows fine in the shade. Shade – Tolerates light shade (about 50%). Moisture – Some species are drought tolerant e.g. Symphytum tuberosum. Cultivated plants require irrigation. USDA Hardiness Zone – 4-9 comfrey crowns and roots are very winter hardy.  Soil – Comfrey is adaptable to many soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils.  pH – Tolerates a wide range (6.5-8.5), although not very sensitive to soil pH, highest yields are reported to occur on soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Perhaps you’re interested in growing comfrey to feed your animals, for medicine, for mulch, for compost or you’re slightly masochistic and want to roll around naked in the pricky beds of biomass (not me). In any case, here’s how to do it. The plant we use in our gardens is Symphytum x uplandicum – ‘Bocking 14’. A sterile cultivar that produces copious quantities of nutrient dense biomass. The following information is based on using this plant.  Choosing the site – We’re growing for biomass and want the plants to receive as much light as possible. Accordingly, we lay out our beds on an east to west axis (we’re in the northern hemisphere).  Irrigation is necessary if you want to get good yields from the plants so picking a place with access to irrigation is of paramount important.  In areas of low rainfall, using the gradient of the land to channel precipitation towards your beds will reduce the water needs of your plants. In areas of high rainfall with a high water table you should consider diverting water away from the beds. Once established, comfrey is difficult to get rid of, so choose a site where you want it to stay. Don’t plant comfrey in any area you cultivate, as the broken root pieces quickly establish into new plants and can out compete slower growing crops.  Position comfrey downhill from where you expect leachate to be present, i.e downhill from a manure pile , compost heap, outside toilet, animal pen etc., can provide passive fertility to the plants and rescue otherwise lost minerals from draining away with the sub soil ground water. 
Grow the comfrey where you want to use it. As you’ll see later we may be harvesting over 1/4 ton biomass from our patch and don’t want to be carrying that over long distances. Preparing the site – Raised beds are a major part of our fertility strategy and overtime retain water and nutrients very efficiently. I use 1.3m wide beds surrounded by 50cm paths for our crops as this allows easy access for harvesting everywhere in the beds without ever having to tread on the soil and the paths are wise enough to take our lawnmower. To form a bed, the area should be cleared of all plants, which is best achieved by sheet mulching the season before. Pernicious perennials or tap rooted biennials should be dug out. After you have cleared the whole area, mark out the bed shape with string and dig out 50cm wide paths around your beds, applying the soil to the surface of the planting area and thereby creating the initial rise of the bed. Fork over the beds well. If a hardpan is present take the time and effort to eliminate it before planting. Depending on the quality of your soil you may want to add extra compost before planting into the bed. If you have sheet mulched the area before hand, with the additional soil from the paths all you need to do is add a good 20cm thick straw mulch (or some other mulch) and it’s ready for planting. A good mulch to start with will help keep the weeds down while your comfrey gets going. You can alter the depth and gradient of the paths to facilitate the required direction of water movement. Planting material – You can plant out with crown divisions or root cuttings best done in the spring when the soil has warmed. A crown division can be obtained from simply putting a spade through the center of a mature comfrey plant and transplanting the divided sections. For our beds, I divided two year old plants into quarters, sometimes sixths, and these established very well in the first year. It’s bests not to harvest the leaf biomass in the first year in order to allow a deep root system to develop. However if you use large divisions you can start harvesting in July. Root cuttings are a great way to plant out large areas of comfrey. The cuttings should be grown on in small pots with 50% compost 50% river sand mix kept moist and planted out in the spring as soon as the first leaves emerge and the soil has warmed. If you are planting large numbers of root cuttings you can plant directly into the beds by creating ‘nests’ in the straw, adding two cupped handfuls of the above mentioned potting mix and plant the cuttings into this. Keep them moist like a wrung out sponge and the success rate will be very close to 100%. Spacing – The plants should be spaced 60cm apart in rows and 60cm apart at diagonals between rows. Plant the rows 15cm from the edge of the beds. Cutting – In the first year allow the plants to establish so that the roots develop well and penetrate deep into the subsoil. Remove any weeds around the plants leaving them on the surface. The following year the cutting can begin. You can scythe the beds for a quick harvest or cut each plant individually with a pair of secateurs or shears cutting to 5cm or so from ground level. The leaves are prickly so if you have sensitive hands wear gloves. Cut the comfrey as the flowering stalks emerge up to four times a year. Allow the plants to flower at least once during the season to provide bee fodder to a range of native bees and honey bees. Leave the last flush of leaves before the winter so that invertebrates can find winter shelter in the undergrowth. You may need to weed between cuts every now and then but generally the comfrey will quickly cover the surface. Feeding – After you have cut the comfrey, mow the pathways between the beds and empty the trimmings to the base of the comfrey plants. Any trimmings from lawns and hedges in the surrounding area can also be used. We are experimenting with growing nitrogen fixing hedging and ground cover plants adjacent to the patch in order to feed our comfrey. A most excellent comfrey feed is undiluted urine applied at a rate of approx 500 ml per plant twice per growing season. Irrigation – Comfrey will produce more biomass if irrigated and in dry climates it’s essential to irrigate. Comfrey plants wilt very fast in hot conditions and will stop photosynthesising at this point. Twenty litres per m2 per week of drought should be more than adequate. The beauty of biological systems are that, if managed properly, each year the soils improve and the ability of the soil to store water will improve over time. We use passive irrigation diverting water from a mountain stream into the paths around the beds. The paths fill with water, we raise the level by blocking the low points with sacks of sawdust and the water is drawn throughout the soil via capillary action. Passive irrigation in our market garden. The paths fill with water and the water permeates throughout the soil via capillary action. As mulch – Freshly cut comfrey leaves make good mulch because they have high nitrogen content, and don’t pull nitrogen from the soil while decomposing. Comfrey’s high potassium content makes it especially beneficial for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, berries, and fruit trees. With adequate feed and watering we’ve seen yields of 2-3kg of biomass per plant per cut. Comfrey beds establishing well. This bed was planted with divided crowns 5 months prior to this photo being taken. Liquid fertliser – What I like to call ‘Comfert’. Fill a barrel, preferably with a bottom tap and a gauze on the inside (to prevent clogging) about 3/4 full with freshly cut comfrey and add water to fill the barrel. Cover it, and let it steep for 3-6 weeks. The smell from the resulting liquid is far from attractive so approach with caution. The tea may be used full strength or diluted by half or more. Don’t apply before heavy rain is forecast as most of the nutrients suspended in the liquid will wash straight through the soil. For the best results apply the feed to your vegetables when they are in most need of the extra fertility. This will be different for each crop, for example, tomatoes are best fed when they are setting fruit and then any time during the fruiting period. Applying comfert before this can be counter productive and make your plants more susceptible to pest problems. The black slurry at the bottom of the barrel can be dispersed evenly back over the comfrey patch. Liquid fertilizer concentrate – ‘Comfert Plus’ can also be made by packing fresh-cut comfrey tops into an old bucket, weighing them down with something heavy, covering tightly, and waiting a few weeks for them to decompose into a black slurry. You can put a hole in the bottom of the bucket and collect the concentrate in another container as it drips out. Dilute this comfrey concentrate about 15 to 1 with water, and use as you would comfert. You can seal this concentrate in plastic jugs until you are ready to use it. Warning! Comfert stinks like hell. My nieces came to visit from London last year and offered to help out in the market garden. One of the tasks that day was to apply comfert to the crops. Let’s just say it did not end well and we had a much better experience taking softwood cuttings the next day. According to Martin Crawford in Creating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops, one cut of comfrey from one plant contains 0.5g of Nitrogen (N) and 10g of potassium (K) to crops. Based on this I calculated how much Potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and biomass the 13 m2 comfrey patch can potentially produce in a year. Below is a table indicating how many comfrey cuts are needed to meet the Nitrogen and Potassium needs of various moderate and heavy cropping fruit and nut trees and annual vegetables. In the 1960s, Lawrence D. Hills used UK gardeners records for a comfrey report. (See the Balkan Ecology Project blog for the results.) Based on these records I calculated a yield of approx. 5.5kg of biomass per plant each year. Using this figure one of our beds should produce approx 286kg of biomass. We shall see as this year we begin our own records. We’re looking to gather some solid data on how comfrey performs in our climate and we’ll be recording the yields from our patch starting this season and for at least the next five years. For more info on our record keeping and research programs see Polyculture Market Garden Study. If you would like to join the ‘who can grow the most comfrey’ experiment and contribute data to our records, send us an email. It will be great to have records from all over the world.

"Hugelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, means hill culture or hill mound. Instead of putting branches, leaves and grass clippings in bags by the curbside for the bin men… build a hugel bed. Simply mound logs, branches, leaves, grass clippings, straw, cardboard, petroleum-free newspaper, manure, compost or whatever other biomass you have available, top with soil and plant your veggies. The advantages of a hugel bed are many, including: The gradual decay of wood is a consistent source of long-term nutrients for the plants. A large bed might give out a constant supply of nutrients for 20 years (or even longer if you use only hardwoods). The composting wood also generates heat which should extend the growing season. Soil aeration increases as those branches and logs break down… meaning the bed will be no till, long term. The logs and branches act like a sponge. Rainwater is stored and then released during drier times. Actually you may never need to water your hugel bed again after the first year (except during long term droughts). Sequester carbon into the soil. On a sod lawn Sepp Holzer (hugelkultur expert) recommends cutting out the sod, digging a one foot deep trench and filling the trench with logs and branches. Then cover the logs with the upside down turf. On top of the turf add grass clippings, seaweed, compost, aged manure, straw, green leaves, mulch, etc…  Sepp Holzer recommends steep hugel beds to avoid compaction from increased pressure over time. Steep beds mean more surface area in your garden for plants and the height makes easy harvesting. The greater the mass, the greater the water-retention benefits. Hugel bed dug in clay with logs put in vertically, next branches and lots of wood chips. Top 6 inches will be wood chips and dirt. This bed will store water and give nutrients for many years to come. Straw bale gardens require less soil, less water and hold heat. As the straw breaks down nutrients feed the plants. Combining a straw surround with a hugel interior, topped by lasagne layering is an excellent idea for an area with poor quality soil. Hugel bed in Ontario, Canada (June 28th) by Tim Burrows. Tim surrounded his very tall hugel bed in pallets! Sheet mulching (lasagne gardening) is like composting in place. Above: just a suggestion as to sheet mulching layers. Nitrogen-rich material such as fresh grass clippings or green leaves put right on the hugelkultur wood would help jump start the composting process. Could also include seaweed, straw, dead leaves, leaf mould, etc.

The first year of break down means the wood (and fungi) steal a lot of the nitrogen out of the surrounding environment, so adding nitrogen during the first year or planting crops that add nitrogen to the soil (like legumes) or planting species with minimal nitrogen requirements is necessary, unless there is plenty of organic material on top of the wood. After the wood absorbs nitrogen to its fill, the wood will start to break down and start to give nitrogen back in the process. In the end you will be left with a beautiful bed of nutrient rich soil. Tree types that work well in hugelkultur:
Hardwoods break down slowly and therefore your hugel bed will last longer, hold water for more years and add nutrients for more years. But softwoods are acceptable as well, a softwood bed will just disintegrate quicker. Mixing woods with softwoods and branches on top, to give off nutrients first, and hardwoods on bottom, sounds like a plan if you have access to multiple types of wood. Yet the newly decomposing softwoods at the top will eat up a lot of nitrogen at first, so compensate for that.

Woods that work best:
Alders, apple, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, oak, poplar, willow (make sure it is dead or it will sprout).

Trees types that work okay:
Black cherry (use only rotted), camphor wood (well aged), cedar/juniper/yew (anti-microbial/anti-fungal, so use only at very bottom or unless already well-aged. Cedar should be broken down before new plant roots reach it), eucalyptus (slightly anti-microbial), osage orange (exceptionally resistant to decay), Pacific yew (exceptionally resistant to decay), pine/fir/spruce (tannins and sap), red mulberry (exceptionally resistant to decay).

Tree types to avoid:
Black locust (will not decompose), black walnut (juglone toxin), old growth redwood (heartwood will not decompose and redwood compost can prevent seed germination).

"Thistles are a bane of picnickers and campers. Who hasn’t trodden on the sharp, unforgiving spines of a thistle when out and about barefoot in grasslands? For many people, relationships with thistles have generally been painful and irritable, but now you can get your own back! One of the great things about thistles is that every single species is edible, so this is great news for foraging beginners! Even the closest lookalikes found here are edible – the sow thistles (Sonchus spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), so when working with the thistles, you can learn to identify and proceed to experiment with complete confidence from the outset. We have at least 14 species of thistle growing wild in the UK, mostly from the Cirsium (aka plume thistles) and Carduus genera. Thistles are found in numerous settings all over our islands and can be a useful soil barometer. Often their presence signifies that the land is fertile, and in many instances, neglected. I eat from a number of different species. These are: creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis), spear thistle (C. vulgare), woolly thistle (C. eriophorum), marsh thistle (C. palustris), and welted thistle (Carduus acanthoides syn C. crispus). As you will discover, plants that have spines to offer protection against predators, have no real need for bitterness. Spear thistle It’s almost impossible to misidentify a thistle. One of the easy-to-spot botanical differences between thistles and their numerous relatives in the daisy family, is that the overlapping bracts (involucre) found directly below the flowers of thistles, are always spiny. Simple! The leaves of the numerous species will differ in size, shape and the density of spine coverage. Most have stiff spines on the margins, but some have soft prickles. You need to discover for yourself which are the more tactile! When in flower, most thistles produce a lovely purple / mauve bloom, but some species are known for their yellow inflorescence (cabbage thistle – Cirsium oleraceum and the Carline thistle – Carlina vulgaris). In all of the thistles, flowers give way to copious amounts of fluffy hairs (pappus) attached to their tiny fruits, superbly designed for air-borne dispersal. A distinguishing feature between the two main generais that Cirsium spp. produce feathered pappus hairs, whereas Carduus spp. only have simple pappus hairs. Creeping thistle produces dense spines on its leaves, but very few spines or hairs on the flowering stems. Spear thistle has large, deeply-lobed leaves with large spines at the margins, as well as hairy, spiny stems. Marsh thistle looks somewhat like spear thistle at an initial glance, but without the large spines and leaf lobes, and usually with a thin, red, leaf margin. Woolly thistle is easily identifiable with large, deeply-lobed, evenly-shaped leaves, and very large flower heads, wrapped in a ‘cobweb’ of cotton-like hairs. This particular species is the largest wild thistle I use, although if you have milk thistle (Silybum marianum) growing in your plot, you can use that too, but you will need good gloves to protect yourself from its long spiny flower heads! Eating milk thistle chokes would of course prevent you harvesting the exceptional liver-supportive medicine found in the seeds. Wooly thistle Creeping thistle will grow in all manner of waste-ground, grasslands, verges and field edges. I also see a lot of spear thistle in similar habitats, although when found in grassland, it’s not as abundant as the creeping species. The root systems explain why; spear thistle has a tap root, whereas creeping thistle grows on rhizomes. The marsh thistle, as its name alludes to, likes damp conditions such as fens, marshes, canal tow-paths and riversides. Woolly thistle is a little bit more selective in its choice of soil and setting, preferring calcareous ground. It too enjoys grasslands. Welted thistle can be found all over the UK, especially loving clay soils. Go prepared! Stiff gloves and a knife are required. Harvest the best leaf mid-ribs in spring when growth is plentiful and quick. Your specimens will be tender and sweeter. Flowering stems will appear from late spring through into autumn. I only consider harvesting from plants whose flower buds are yet to really begin unfurling. Flower buds (chokes) are available all summer. In Portugal, a number of thistle species are still collected in spring and sold at markets. A recent academic study highlighted the nutritional value from eating thistles. The findings are contained within ‘Ethnobotany In The New Europe’ by Manuel. P de Santayana et al. (Eds), published June 2010. In the study, researchers noted the wide range of thistle species collected, and concentrated on the nutritional value of one particular thistle (Scolymus hispanicus – Spanish or golden thistle). This plant is collected by villagers in various areas of the countryside. Bunches of the stripped leaf mid-ribs are sold and bought in a number of markets in different areas. Levels of certain nutrients were analysed and compared to some commonly consumed vegetables. Their findings show that the thistle contained consistently higher levels of important major nutrients than some of our commonly consumed cultivated vegetables. Weight for weight, thistles come out higher in fibre, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc and other nutrients. Is it likely that the thistles found wild here will be similarly endowed with a range of important vitamins and minerals? I’m more than happy to work on the assumption that this will be the case. Many other wild plant species are known to contain high concentrations of important nutrients. Preparing thistles is pretty easy. Simply choose the most tender specimens. If using the petioles, then cut and strip all the spines off, before peeling the outer, fibrous layer from the stalk. Use raw as crudités, pickle or ferment them, or chop into salads and serve them with a tangy vinaigrette. If cooking, they don’t require long! Preparing the stems is similar, but they are hollow. These can be used in similar ways to the petioles, or you can stuff them, roast them, and braise them. As relatives of the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), thistles produce edible, if smaller, ‘chokes’. These are the crunchy, immature bases, or capitulum, of the composite flower-head. As you would do with globe artichokes, peel away the bracts to get to the prize. I only choose the largest wild species for this. Happy foraging!

"Some plants seem to be our constant companions, no matter where we live. Often, they will also be some of our really useful species. It will soon become clear that the common mallow (Malva sylvestris) is one of these plants. Rather than being looked upon as a weed, the mallows can be more usefully described as some of our gloriously abundant plant helpers. A number of mallow species have long been used as a food and medicine, wherever they are found native, and especially in the Middle East and Asia. You won’t have far to go to find the common mallow in most parts of Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia either. Common mallow can be found growing erect or prostrate, which may initially cause confusion because it’s easy to assume they might be two different species. Mallow’s kidney-shaped or palmately-lobed leaves are notably creased, typically with dentate margins. The leaves often show a purple spot in the centre of the base of the leaf and this can also be seen to run down the petiole on some specimens. On other specimens, the purple spotting and colouring is completely absent. Mallow leaves have long petioles. Their deep green foliage hints at a renowned drought tolerance. During flowering, the leaves appear alternately on the stems. Holding a leaf relays the surface coarseness. But tear and crush one, and you discover a family pattern – the mucilage. You will soon experience a slimy and tacky feel between your fingers. All parts of the plant contain mucilage. In bloom, the Malvaceae family plants produce five large notched petals in each open flower. Common mallow has showy pink petals laced with darker-coloured strokes. In the centre of the flower lies a pollen-loaded column of fused stamens. This surrounds the stigma, which rises above the column.  Mallow is known to freely seed. The round seed pods, known as ‘cheeses’, soon follow flowering. These were once munched by children on their way to and from school. The pods are held on stalks, close to the flowering stem. Mallow will be found on most soils, from coastal to marginally upland habitats, with most settings being adequate for this resilient plant. It loves waste-ground as well as grassland; gravel as much as coastal edges, and waysides and roadsides as well as hedges.  Leaves, flowers, seed pods, roots. Leaves, in spring; flowers from late spring; seed pods from early summer. Roots could be harvested from larger rosettes whenever large enough. Medicinal and nutritional constituents Vitamins A,B,C,E; inulin; mucilage; phenols; flavonoids; essential fatty acids; fibre; calcium; magnesium; zinc; selenium; potassium. Traditional and contemporary uses As with many wild food plants, the common mallow has also had a long history of medicinal use. Due to its high mucilage content, mallows make excellent soothing demulcent herbs, especially for cases of inflammation, either for the urinary, digestive or respiratory systems. Pregnant women or new mothers may like to know that mallow leaves can provide useful amounts of iron, as well as being quite high in zinc and most vitamins.  All of the mallow family with exception to the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum), are reportedly edible. With their high mucilage content, the leaves can usefully be taken as an emergency antidote to irritation or burning that may be caused by the accidental consumption of acrid plants in the buttercup family. Creative cooks can substitute mallow for spinach in many dishes, including soups, salads, gnocchi and quiche. I have even flash-fried larger mallow leaves for just one second in hot oil to make ‘popadoms’. Mallow also makes a great addition to soups, whereby the mucilage helps to thicken them.  In Jewish culture, mallow has been been considered the ‘most important plant in local gather society’. Every spring mallow is gathered in the countryside. Its common name in both Hebrew and Arabic, translates to ‘bread’.  During the war of 1948, when Jerusalem was under siege, mallow was an important famine crop, and one that is still celebrated on Independence day every year with a traditional dish made from mallow leaves. Common mallow can be substituted for the family relative Corchorus olitorius aka ‘jutes mallow’, when making the Egyptian / Middle-Eastern dish ‘Molokhia’. This traditional dish is usually served with chicken.  In China, mallow roots are a popular and a common ingredient in making hearty, yet medicinally potent soups and broths. The inulin-rich tap roots of a number of different mallow species, including common mallow, have been used. The seed pods can be substituted for most of the egg white if wanting to make mallow meringues. Simply boil up the peeled seed pods using 3 parts water 1 part seed pods, and reduce the liquid by half. For every half cup of liquid add one egg white, ¼ tsp of cream of tartar, some vanilla and castor sugar, then whip it up until foamy and stiff, just like meringues.  21st Century Foraging  The Medicinal Forest Garden  The Fast Wild Food Cookbookby Johnny Jumbalaya  Amazing Moringa: Medicinal, Edible & Easy to Grow  How to Make your own Sloe Gin Chris Hope, aka Chris Phyto, was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic plant lover, forager and teacher, who sadly died in 2021.";Permaculture Magazine UK
"This hearty lasagne is delicious cold with salad the next day, if there is any left. 600g (21 oz) aubergines 
500g (17.5 oz/3.5 cups) onions, diced
3 cloves garlic
2 stalks celery, diced
600g (21 oz) courgettes 
1 red pepper, diced
100g (3.5 oz/2 cups) spinach or chard, chopped
Olive oil
800g (28 oz/5 ⅓ cup) tomatoes, chopped
Plus 2 or 3 tomatoes, sliced, to decorate
240g (8.5 oz/1.5 cups) cooked beans
(400g tin, drained)
1-2 tbsp chopped herbs – basil, parsley or oregano (or a mixture of all three)
Salt and pepper to taste For the garlic bread
A crusty loaf of bread 
4-10 cloves garlic (I like it strong!)
0.5-1 cup olive oil (it depends how large the loaf is)
Pepper
An oven dish approximately 25 x 25cm (10 x 10in) Preheat the oven to 180oC fan (200oC/400oF/gas mark 6). Finely chop the garlic and mix into the olive oil. Add a little pepper, stir and leave to infuse. Slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways into 5mm thick slices. Pour some olive oil into the pan and soften the onions, garlic and celery on a low heat.  When cooked, add the red pepper, beans and tomatoes. Simmer for around 15 minutes until the sauce is cooked through. Meanwhile, drizzle olive oil onto a griddle and cook the aubergines and courgettes, several slices at a time, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Pour some of the tomato sauce into the oven dish, add a layer of aubergine, then more sauce, a layer of courgette, and so on until the dish is filled with layers of sauce, aubergine and courgette. Decorate with slices of tomato. Put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Slice the bread so the knife goes about 90% through the loaf, leaving the base intact and the slices attached to each other. Put in a baking dish and, using a spoon, drizzle the garlic oil over both sides of each slice.  15 minutes before the lasagne is ready, put the bread in the oven. When the lasagne is cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the crusty garlic bread and a large salad, or dish of steamed seasonal green vegetables. Tip – Frying pan will work if you don’t have a griddle. This recipe adapts well to other vegetables. In the winter, use slices of cooked potato, parsnip, sweet potato or squash. Cooked whole cabbage and kale leaves make lovely ‘lasagne sheets’ too.  The Creative Kitchenby Stephanie Hafferty  No Dig Organic Home and Gardenby Stephanie Hafferty and Charles Dowding  Seasonal Pesto and Hummus Recipes  Growing Winter Salads Stephanie Hafferty is a no dig gardener, writer and author of The Creative Kitchen and coauthor of No Dig Organic Home and Garden.";Permaculture Magazine UK
"My name is Suzanne Pendleton and I live in Swinton, Salford (UK) and have been involved in the Greater Manchester Swift Street initiative since August 2024, which has been led by the RSPB. During lockdown I started to value my time outside as so many families did too. I enjoyed time in our little garden more and spotted some birds as they zoomed and screamed over the house. I wasn’t quite sure what they were and asked my friend Kathleen who lived on a surrounding road what they might be. She enlightened me. They were Swifts, a species recently added to the UK’s Red List of birds, meaning they are now amongst our most threatened. Then the summer was over and the swifts left Swinton heading back to Africa.  Each year since, I have eagerly anticipated the return of the Swifts. My understanding grew and I learnt of their declining numbers, now less than 60,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Along with developing a stiff neck constantly looking up to the sky, watching their incredible aerial manoeuvres.  I am privileged to live in a friendly neighbourhood on our lane. The community are always up for helping, and we pull together to help each other. We have a community messaging service which came into its own in lockdown, and continues to be a fabulous way to share information and request help and advice. During the last few years I had messaged our community group and asked if anyone knew about our Swifts and where they were nesting. Initially we were unsuccessful in understanding, but in spring 2024 we struck lucky and finally worked out the eaves where they lived. I’d also discovered Swift Mapper (an app for recording the location of Swift nesting sites) enabling us to understand we had four nest sites on the Lane and surrounding roads.  We also realised that there was another small colony locally less that 1/4 mile away. Last August, a resident of this local road got in touch to say Roshni (Parmar-Hill, Community Engagement Officer) from the RSPB had been to visit their colony. She asked if we’d be interested in getting involved with developing our Swift Street – thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery – and I eagerly accepted the offer. We used our community messaging group to share the news of the Swift Street development and I was overwhelmed by the local response. So many families were keen to help our Swift population, with more than 80 boxes requested. I think the consensus was that we are so privileged that these incredible urban birds choose our lane as their home, and as their nesting places can be threatened by redevelopment, having the opportunity to install boxes is a wonderful chance to do something proactive to help.  Roshni and I visited local homes who had expressed interest, helping families select potential sites for their boxes to be positioned. With Roshni’s guidance we talked about what Swifts need and I and residents began to understand more about how Swifts live. They are remarkably compatible with humans, don’t need a bird bath, bird table etc. as they feed on insects on the wing. I discovered along with other residents that the best way we could help our Swifts was to protect their current nesting sites, add boxes for more birds to nest in and to do all we could to support insect populations. For example, considering planting in our gardens to promote insect life, adopting No Mow May and not using insecticides. Those who weren’t able to install a box could instead help in other ways, so this made the project accessible for all – everyone could join in. Next came the production of the boxes. Roshni contacted local colleges and we were thrilled when a local skills centre suggested their joinery students could make these free of charge. Production began and numbers of those interested had grown as the message about the project spread, and so 100 boxes were produced.  Meanwhile, local guiding groups learnt of the initiative and Roshni visited the groups that I lead, as Brown Owl – 90 girls and young women were keen to learn about Swifts and how they could help. The groups were already keen to learn about environmental matters, and this project really whetted their appetite. The Brownies, Guides and Rangers designed posters, made seed bombs and grew in their understanding of our Swifts. Once the production of the boxes was finished the Brownies, Rangers and Guides got stuck into painting them with an environmentally friendly product which would protect the boxes, and a local lady Haldis (a RSPB Swift Champion, a voluntary role which supports local conservation efforts to protect the species) made the nest cups which would be inserted into each box.  We arrived at installation day on Saturday 8th March, with 25 boxes going up on that first day. By the end of March, 80 had been erected by a local roofer, Ryan. Of course, we needed to celebrate the returning of our precious Swifts and so we began planning our community event. Volunteers came forward from the surrounding roads and we met in a resident’s kitchen each Wednesday, so all could contribute ideas. Other local guiding groups wanted to contribute and so they made nature-themed bunting, and we were thrilled when the church on the lane offered their venue as a space for us to celebrate. The local dance and drama group wanted to be involved and so their leaders and young people planned songs and a drama production with poetry. And as if we weren’t already exciting enough, we then heard the news that RSPB Ambassador Megan McCubbin would love to come along to formally open our Swift Street.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on 17th May, with a fantastic community event. Sixty families made bee hotels, children had Swift-themed face paint, and a plant swap was popular. RSPB provided and led crafts, and local artists supported youngsters to make Swift puppets. More than 300 residents attended and watched the young people perform. The ribbon was cut revealing a beautiful Swift Street banner created by a local artist, alongside Swift boxes 99 and 100 positioned proudly on the front of the church. And yes, we had Swifts soaring high above us all day (perhaps watching the proceedings?) to the delight of the watching children and residents. As the street party continued into the evening we couldn’t believe our eyes when a ‘banger’ (a young Swift, which gets its name from its tendency to bang against prospective nest to check if they’re occupied or not) attempted to enter one of the newly positioned boxes. A perfect end to a fabulous day.  It’s been an absolute honour to be involved in this project and I feel so lucky that our community have been able to do something practical to support our local Swifts.

"We are delighted to announce the recipients of the 2025 Permaculture Magazine Award, in collaboration with Lush Spring Prize. Four projects have been awarded from a fund of £25,000. The Permaculture Magazine Award is a celebration of the vital work of permaculture projects from around the world. The Permaculture Magazine Award was established in 2018 to celebrate the vital work of permaculture projects around the world. To date (May 2025) it has awarded 28 projects with over £155,000. The award has received hundreds of applications, and it is a privilege to highlight this vital regenerative work that is world changing. Coordinating a network of permaculture centres, NGO Permaculture Ukraine offers training, events and educational resources across Ukraine, also ensuring accessibility for internally displaced people (IDP) and former military personnel. The organisation was founded following the first Permaculture Design Course (PDC) in Ukraine in 2011, and has held at least one PDC annually, actively seeking funding to make training accessible to vulnerable groups. Following the full-scale invasion in 2022, its focus expanded to include: The 14 permaculture centres provide training, shelter for IDPs and war-abandoned animals, and rehabilitation for children and adults. Its designers also create communal projects, including schools and homes for disabled people. Despite air raids and blackouts, NGO Permaculture Ukraine successfully hosted a two-day permaculture festival in Kyiv’s botanical garden in September 2024, drawing 100 participants eager to engage with top regenerative practitioners. NGO Permaculture Ukraine empowers Ukrainians for sustainable living and transformative change. Through active social media engagement and collaborations with ecovillages, zero-waste networks, and other ecological movements, it extends its influence and inspires a growing audience to adopt permaculture principles for Ukraine’s regeneration. https://permaculture.in.ua Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Since its founding in 2021, Battmung has: Recognising the importance of connecting people, Battmung also contributed to the founding of the Permaculture Institute of Korea (P.I.K) in 2023. Its goal is to organise its regional network and regenerate South Korea through permaculture, restoring soil, food chains, ecological awareness, and local economies. www.instagram.com/battmung.log Eco Centro Allpa Tarpuna works for the regeneration of degraded lands, food sovereignty and community autonomy, with a focus on indigenous communities in Ecuador. Founded in 2004, it was born out of the return of its founders to their community after experiencing the negative impacts of conventional agriculture and agrochemicals. This return marked the beginning of a path towards reconnecting with indigenous ancestral knowledge and adopting permaculture and organic production. One of the key achievements has been the recovery of soils degraded by monocultures and eucalyptus. Although slow, this process has demonstrated the benefits of a regenerative approach and strengthened the resilience of the community. Allpa Tarpuna is currently focusing on: Allpa Tarpuna integrates bio-construction, renewable energy and sustainable water management into its practices. It also encourages the preservation of ancestral seeds and agro-ecological techniques such as crop rotation, reducing dependence on chemicals. In the future, it wants to expand its training in permaculture design, combining indigenous knowledge with modern regenerative solutions. It seeks to empower more local farmers, promoting designs that restore the connection between people and nature. Allpa Tarpuna is a living indigenous family that sows regeneration, inspiring a sustainable and resilient balance. https://allpatarpuna.org HortaFCUL is a community-based permaculture project based in Lisbon University’s Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). The initiative was launched by a group of biology students concerned about the gap between sustainability ideals and the university’s environmental impact. This bottom-up project has developed an important role as a catalyst of practical scientific-based knowledge. Nowadays, HortaFCUL is a resilient, sustainable and inclusive community, allowing the general public to learn more about nature-based solutions. It has five subprojects at campus level and relies on a volunteer-based horizontally-organised guardians collective to maintain the project’s green areas. HortaFCUL, as a permaculture project, achieves its central goals by closing functional loops related to human activities.

"As politicians wait, grassroots changemakers are restoring ecosystems and rebuilding resilience. They are living examples that regeneration is not just possible, it’s already happening all over the world.  The Lush Spring Prize 2025 is showcasing this work and has awarded around £250,000 to 19 groups, celebrating regenerative organisations and practitioners from around the world. Lead image: Clockwise from top left: Agro-Pueblos (Colombia), Ñu’u Ndito (Mexico), Global Ecovillage Network (Global), Land in Our Names (UK) In a joyous, collaborative and inspiring week of celebrations, the 2025 recipients were honoured as part of a celebratory event held in Dorset (UK), where the Lush Cosmetics company is headquartered. The event was attended by prize recipients, Spring Prize judges, Lush staff, press, funders and other regenerative practitioners. Co-designed with the prize recipients themselves, the event provides a space to connect, co-learn and share stories of regeneration. It offered an opportunity to explore both the diversity of people and organisations that make up the regenerative movement and the common challenges, learnings and successes that unites it. Each Spring Prize year sees different themes emerge that are shaped by the organisations that receive a prize. In 2025, these include the importance of weaving ancestral wisdom with scientific approaches; working at multiple scales and legally recognising the rights of nature, and learning from those on the frontlines that are facilitating regenerative work in conflict zones or regions experiencing natural disasters. In 2025, the backdrop of violence and conflict looms large. Prize recipients from Lebanon and Ukraine are responding to invasions by powerful aggressors, in Myanmar they are working in a context of ongoing internal conflict and many of the Indigenous groups are frequently facing the threat of violence.  The Spring Prize 2025 event allows these groups to come together and share what regenerative work in these situations looks like in a way that may challenge the existing narrative: “In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the biggest achievement for our organisation is to continue our activities and find ways to be useful for Ukrainian society like creating permaculture public spaces and rehabilitating people in our demonstration centers. The war has taught us that strength is in unity and networks, that autonomous homesteads and farms that grow their own food and preserve their seeds can not only survive but also help other people, and that international support and networks matter.” NGO Permaculture in Ukraine While humanity witnesses declining biodiversity, climate catastrophes and widespread conflict, these organisations highlight how regenerative practices are not just a source of hope but a necessary and much needed response.

Examples of this year’s awarded projects include: Aguaje palm tree seedlings were distributed among Kukama families in Parinari, Loreto, Peru, as part of the reforestation and conservation initiative led by Huaynakana. Extractivism represents a constant threat to the Kukama territory in Peru and the loss of the Kukama peoples’ cultural identity. Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana exists to protect this. The Kukama people conceive of the territory as a whole and women having an intrinsic connection to it. The term ‘kukama’ for example is composed of two words: ‘ku’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘kama’ meaning ‘bosom,’ and it signifies ‘field-bosom’ or ‘nourished by the field.’ Given the Kukama peoples’ lives are reliant on the forest ecosystems of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and considering how they have adapted and coexisted with them for decades, the territory and the rivers are inseparable from their culture and way of life. They consider the rivers to be living beings with spirits, and therefore sacred. Founded in 2001, Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana embarked on a long journey of collective actions, protests, and mobilisations in pursuit of environmental justice as the river’s health declined as a result of extractive industries. In September 2021 Huaynakana filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognise the Marañón River as a living being and subject of rights. In March 2024, the provincial court of Nauta ruled that the Marañón River has intrinsic rights, including the right to flow, to be free from pollution, and to be restored to environmental health. This decision also recognised Indigenous communities as the river’s legal representatives, defenders, and guardians. This landmark ruling was ratified by the higher court last November. Huaynakana plays a key role in defending the Marañón’s rights and supporting the regeneration and conservation of the waterways through reforestation efforts because without the river, these unique forests cannot exist. Mushrooms harvested from the Ubuntu food forest Ubuntu Learning Hub Trust was set up in 2022 with a mission to support people who are in transition towards more resilient futures and a healthier planet. The Trust immediately began to set up the Ubuntu Learning Centre as an open learning space for all ages as well as a demonstration centre for integrating technologies that are in tune with a healthy Mother Earth. The learning centre sits on a two-hectare site in Chikancila village in Chongwe district of Lusaka Province of Zambia. It is founded on the African philosophy of Ubuntu which helps people to learn what it means to be truly human. It hosts people from all walks of life who are looking for pathways to escape the rat race and curve more sustainable futures for themselves, their families and the communities where they come from. The Trust uses agro-ecological practices to regenerate the degraded farmland that was damaged over decades of poor land husbandry. For example, the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) technique has helped to restore much of the indigenous vegetation on the land. People come to Ubuntu to explore the meaning of life and to find their life purpose. They stay at Ubuntu for varying lengths of time and in the process they are engaged in intercultural exchanges as well as learning how to take care of themselves and of Mother Earth. The Trust offers life changing experiences rather than certificates and the opportunity to carve out an earth-centred worldview for themselves.

The Cultural Conservancy (TCC) is a Native-led non-profit organisation based in San Francisco, California. Founded in 1985, its mission is to protect and revitalise Indigenous cultures through the direct application of traditional knowledge and practices on ancestral lands. It works with Native/Indigenous peoples locally and globally on community-based projects that are shaped by community requests and guided by the Native Advisory Council of Traditional Knowledge Holders, land-care practitioners, and community leaders. From language revitalisation and traditional carving projects to Indigenous agricultural sciences and traditional land tending, critical to its work is the acknowledgement of the sacred relationship Native peoples have to their lands and waters and the importance of this relationship to their physical, mental, and community health. Through its flagship Native Foodways Programme and its land project Heron Shadow, it: Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design.

Harvesting with Battmung friends The LUSH Spring Prize is a joint venture between LUSH Cosmetics and Ethical Consumer and is now in its sixth prize cycle, having started in 2017. The Spring Prize has distributed more than £1.3 million to regenerative projects worldwide. The LUSH Spring Prize was set up to support ‘regenerative’ projects – those that go beyond sustainability by taking holistic approaches to building the health of ecology, economy and social systems. It seeks to support those who are leaving the world lusher than they found it, and are actively restoring all the systems they are part of. By supporting regenerative projects the Spring Prize hopes to raise the profile of the movement as a whole to inspire more individuals, groups, communities, funders, media platforms and businesses to start engaging with regenerative processes.  The Spring Prize judging panels are made up of people drawn from a diverse range of movements that represent regenerative design, permaculture, food sovereignty, transition towns, biomimicry, eco-village networks and various social justice movements. Each prize cycle a ‘Lush Customer Judge’ and ‘Lush Staff Judge’ are also selected to act as additional independent members of the judging panel.  The collaborative prizes have separate panels, which also include judges from the main Spring Prize panel. The majority of the judging panel for the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Award self identify as Indigenous themselves, some being previous recipients of the award. The judges are not just involved in choosing the recipients but are involved in shaping the prize as a whole, attending the event and connecting with prize recipients.

"Around 40 years ago, the Sahel, an extremely arid region located in central Africa, was an area of agricultural desolation. Due to natural factors such as heavy drought and interannual variability, combined with anthropocentric influences like climate change, overgrazing and deforestation, the environment has become particularly unstable with little possibility for productivity.  Furthermore, when rain does fall in the arid region, the soil is so dry due to a lack of precipitation, that water immediately ‘runs off’ or evaporates, failing to soak into the depleted earth. Some countries within the region, such as Burkina Faso, faced up to 24% of their arable lands classed as highly degraded in 1998 (Maatman et al., 1998).  In the early 2000s, NGOs and organisations such as the United Nations, the World Food Programme and WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), amongst others, sought to reverse the desertification of many parts of Africa, including the Sahel, in cooperation with farmers and communities from the affected regions. Using the ancient ‘half moon’ water harvesting technique – used for centuries in Africa and the Middle East, the revitalised technique aims to facilitate water retention and re-green the ecosystem. Heavy machinery or hand tools can be used to plough the soil roughly 30cm down in a semi-circle or ‘half moon’ shape. The diameter of these half moons are typically about 4 metres. When it rains, the contours catch the rainwater, preventing runoff and allowing it to infiltrate the soil. This creates ‘favourable micro-climate conditions’ allowing drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet to be planted.  If planted on steep slopes, half-moon ‘bunds’ can assist the growth of tree species. They can also be used in combination with controlled grazing to boost re-vegetation. In Niger, The World Food Programme (WFP) has been implementing half-moon planting projects since 2014. Just 5 years into the scheme, the benefits of its implementation were examined by a progress-review. In 2019, over 400 households had restored approximately 3,000 acres of land, largely for use in producing food for livestock. This has promoted social cohesion and economic growth by providing more jobs and stabilising agricultural output in a formerly capricious climate. This scenario exhibits the benefits of a localised, small-scale regenerative farming technique such as half-moon planting through its trickle-down effects, stipulating broader socio-economic growth. A study on the impact of reformed agroecological techniques was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Burkina Faso. Figures revealed that fields ploughed using the half-moon method saw the rates of increase for grain yield at 8% (The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 2017). As farmers sought new ways to boost crop yields, regenerative farming techniques such as the half-moon method were found to be successful when used in conjunction with others. In Burkina Faso, half-moon planting is exercised alongside the Zaï technique, which is useful when adapting to various soil types and structures. The Zaï method, suitable to the arid Sahel region, uses similar methods seen in the half-moons, but alternatively involves digging smaller pits in non-permeable soil to intercept water and gather compost material. These pits are slightly smaller than the half-moons and so are less labour intensive and can be utilised in smaller growing plots. They are roughly between 15-50cm across; 5-15cm deep; and positioned 80cm apart. This technique was reintroduced to the area in the 1980s by farmer and agronomist Yacouba Sawadogo, who pioneered the method of filling the holes with manure to further break up the earth and bolster soil productivity.

"Traditional Māori time systems were measured in accordance to the night as opposed to the Western proxy of daylight. Each night of the lunar month had a particular name and this cumulatively formed a lunar calendar known as ‘Maramataka‘. Farming according to the Maramataka lunar calendar is used in conjunction with Māori regenerative farming techniques to adapt to nature’s schedule as opposed to imposing controls on the earth’s processes. Many farmers are now seeking to turn back to these ancient methods in line with broader sustainability imperatives. Under the Maramataka calendar, individual lunar nights were marked according to how optimal they were for catching fish, eels or planting crops, with each night having its own name. A good example is eel fishing. It is not productive on a full moon – Rākaunui – because the moon’s light would not allow eel to hunt their prey, as the prey could see them. As with biodynamics (the Rudolf Steiner lunar approach for farming), planting crops is nest at a full moon, when the gravitational pull is at its highest, because it has maximum influence on water in the soil. “Despite the use of Maramataka being limited to a relative few today, largely because of colonisation, interest in and revival of this knowledge and practice is growing.”1 Many farmers are returning to the use of farming tactics such as Maramataka planting in line with broader regenerative goals. The Revitalise Te Taiao programme aims to fund sustainable and lucrative agribusiness solutions to cultivate Te Taiao (the natural world). This project provided $2.7 million in funding to Miru Young and Mohi Beckham, farmers based in the North Island’s Bay of Plenty, to trial agriculture techniques which aim to “enhance the mana and mauri of the soil” across 10 farm sites. As part of the scheme, both farmers undertook rigorous research, sowing pasture throughout different moon phases from resting and dormant phases to high-energy phases for plant growth. Soon, grass seeds sown during the high energy periods of the Maramataka calendar outgrew neighbouring crops planted in other phases, even if the latter had been sown 10 days before. Despite still being in the trial stages of Maramataka planting, Miru and Mohi observed various positive impacts of the scheme within the first few months. Their land has seen higher productivity and crop yields, with a 93% crop survival rate under Maramataka planting, that is an increase of 13% from the usual 80% under previous methods. One of the main issues associated with returning to traditional farming methods on a broader scale is competing with intensive methods in New Zealand’s modern agricultural industry. After settlers from the West arrived in New Zealand during the 18th and 19th centuries, intensive farming practices quickly became widespread.  As farming in the country has continuously expanded into the modern day, with agricultural exports making up a large proportion of the country’s GDP, traditional farming methods have become far less lucrative in the broader market. This meant that Māori farmers had to adopt newer techniques, as those trying to maintain the traditional methods were faced with far lower crop yields and income. Rural management programmes and sustainability objectives are constantly investigating new and feasible ways to rejuvenate te ao Māori farming techniques, with the Revitalise Te Taiao programme representing just one of many schemes. The Maramataka lunar calendar is part of a broader Maori worldview known as Mātauranga Māori – a term used to describe the collective knowledge of Māori living in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the knowledge passed down from their ancestors. Kaitiakitanga (stewardship/management) and the link between Whakapapa (Māori genealogy/ancestral descent) and Whenua (land) are key areas of te ao Māori and Mātauranga values.  By embracing schools of thought that are native to Aotearoa, alongside promoting equitable stewardship across modern farming methodologies, high agricultural output can be attained. Reforming the agribusiness in New Zealand will involve reintegrating Māori into decision making processes, embracing cross-cultural thought processes and utilising western technological advancements for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.

"Lammas is a celebration of the summer and the gathering in of the grain harvest. This was especially significant in the past. After all the hard work of getting the grain crop cut, threshed, stored and stacked, there came a time for feasting, celebration and assessment. Lammas is a Saxon name meaning ‘Loaf-mass’. Lughnasadh (pronounced Loo-nas-ah) is Irish Gaelic. On Lammas Eve fires were lit on Lammas mounds such as Silbury Hill at Avebury, to honour the Corn Mother as she gives birth to her harvest child, the Grain. This is the seed that will bring next year’s harvest as well as the grain that will sustain life throughout the winter. The month of August was the month of the Grain Mother. An ‘augur’ is an old word for seer and meant ‘increaser’. The great abundance of the Earth Mother is reflected in the titles she was given at this time: The Grain Mother, Barley Mother, Corn Mother, Demeter, Ceres, Cerealia, Grain, the Wise One of the Earth, the Increaser, She who is the seed, who is the womb, who is the soil, the Great Provider, the Preserver of Life. Cutting the ‘corn’ seems to be a general term for all cereal crops, whether they are wheat, barley, rye or oats. There were many customs and rituals throughout Europe to honour the first and the last sheaf of corn to be cut. The last sheaf was often cut by the youngest girl present and fashioned into a Corn Maiden. It was carried joyfully back to the village, sometimes plaited and decked with ribbons, and usually hung over the fireplace. Sometimes it was dressed in women’s clothes, and ritually burnt on the Lammas Fire. Sometimes these Corn Maidens were kept until Yule when they were divided up amongst the cattle or kept until the spring. Sometimes they were kept with the date tied to them. Many Corn Maidens would be seen hanging above the fireplace. In Scotland the ‘young maid’ was made out of the last stalks cut, and kept. The ‘old wife’ was made out of the first stalks cut and was passed on to the nearest farm that had not finished bringing in the corn. This was then passed round until it ended up at the last farm to be cut. Another old European custom was to weave the last sheaf into a large Corn Mother with a smaller corn doll inside it, representing next year’s unborn harvest. The regenerative power of the Earth is never more manifest than now as the grain harvest is gathered in and the Sun’s cycle begins to wane. The Cauldron of Regeneration was central to Celtic spiritual understanding. We are renewed by sleep and darkness, through many deaths and rebirths, and by the sacrifice of our outer lives for the inner journey. Here at Lammas, the doorway to the inner realms is opening. This is the symbolism behind the Demeter/Kore/Persephone story. Demeter, the Corn Mother, represents the ripe corn of this year’s harvest, and Kore or Persephone represents the grain-seed who lives in the dark throughout the winter and reappears in the Spring. Persephone’s descent into the Underworld is a mythical interpretation of the seed lying in the ground during the dark winter months, and her reappearance as the young maid, or the new sprouting seed, in the spring. This story shows us the Triple Goddess in all her aspects: as Earth Mother, the abundant provider; as the Crone, the wisdom found within; and as the Maiden who returns renewed in the spring. Pluto/Hades’ abduction of Persephone is a later reworking of this older myth. After all the manifest energy and activity of the early summer, it is good to make time now to rest and to assimilate all that has happened during the Sun’s active phase. Lammas celebrations would probably have begun with the cutting of the last sheaf of corn. Although the 2nd of August is the calendar date for Lammas, the great Lammas fairs and feasts would probably have lasted from mid July to mid August and would have peaked around the time of the harvest Full Moon. Once the grain had been safely gathered in and the men returned from their hunting trips, it was a time for feasting, dancing and merry-making, a great celebration of the first of the harvest and assessment of the year’s achievements. Beer, wine, cider and whisky made from the previous year’s harvest, were ritually drunk, celebrating the transformative power of Fire and Water. Cooking fires were honoured as they too embodied the power of Fire and Water. Bread was made from the new grain and thanks were given to the Sun’s life energy reborn as the bread of life. This is a busy time for harvesting herbs and collecting herb seeds to sow in the spring. Give thanks and blessings as you pick them, dry them and store them. Review what you know about them and ways you can use them both physically and metaphysically. Harvest sage at the end of July, before the flowers have come out. Sage is a herb associated with wisdom and releasing blocks in expression. It is connected to the throat chakra and is for those who have something to say but cannot let it out. It will help you express your emotions. Make the herb tea in the usual way. The infusion is a useful antiseptic herb for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers and mouth infections. It can be used as a gargle, for bathing wounds, sores, and to stop bleeding. Use the tea infusion externally and then drink afterwards as well. It will dry up excess secretions such as catarrh or sinusitis. It contains oestrogen and is useful in the menopause and for delayed menstruation. Burn dried sage to cleanse and purify. Waft the smoke around a person to cleanse their aura (called smudging). This is a good way to begin any ritual or ceremony. N.B. It must not be taken if pregnant, and because of its drying action, it must not be taken for long periods of time. It will dry up mother’s milk. Care must be taken by those who are insulin-dependent, and to be avoided by epileptics. Garlands of meadowsweet were traditionally worn for the Lammas celebrations. Its heady perfume expands the psyche, and builds inner strength. It enhances flexibility and connection to the inner levels. It is a mild sedative and painkiller containing salicylic acid (aspirin) that affects the rate at which blood clots. It is a good digestive tonic that reduces excess acidity and is useful for heartburn, hyperacidity, gastritis and peptic ulcers. As it cleanses the body of harmful acids, it is useful for any inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is a strong diuretic (increases urine) and can be used for any bladder or kidney complaint including cystitis. It reduces stagnation in the liver and therefore will help the immune system function more effectively. Its harvest time is July and August when the flowers are just beginning to open. Collect them in brown paper bags to dry for later use. N.B. Avoid if on anti-coagulant drugs. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Sacred Earth Celebrations, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"There are various methods for drying herbs for herbal recipes but they all require that the herb is dried and stored out of the light. I prefer to use brown paper bags, other people hang them up in bunches or lay them between sheets of newspaper or brown paper. • If using brown paper bags always label the bags with the name of the herb, the date and where you picked it. This is good practice and a good habit to get into as plants can change a lot in the drying process. Even if you think you will know what it is, it is surprising how you can forget, especially if you bag up several herbs over a period of a few weeks. • Leave the bags in a dry warm environment for several weeks. Put them in the airing cupboard if you have one, hang over the wood-burner or leave them on top of radiators. Shake the bags and turn the leaves over with your hands every day or two. It is essential to do this to stop any mould getting in to the herbs while they are still drying. • The herbal properties of leaves and flowers will deteriorate after 1 year so they need to be re-collected every year. Fruit, seeds, berries, roots and bark will last for 2 years. It is light that destroys the herbal properties of herbs, so at its simplest herbs can be stored all year in brown paper bags, although if they are kept in the kitchen they will need to be kept in a plastic container or airtight tin to keep them dry. Keeping the herbs in a dedicated leather or cotton bag is the traditional medicine way and these are hung somewhere warm and dry, near a radiator or fire. Putting them into dark glass jars is good in a kitchen because of the condensation. Clear jam jars are fine if they are kept in a dark cupboard. At its simplest the jar can be kept in a brown paper bag or more creative ways can be found. Herb teas vary in taste and quality. Buying popular blends as tea bags is convenient, but be aware that the herbs may be old by the time you drink them, and the herbs may have been grown in monocultures and sprayed with petrochemicals. It is infinitely better to make your own. • Making herb teas is not an exact science, especially when using the common safe plants. Interestingly, different herbalists use different amounts. I use about a teaspoonful of dried herbs or a small pile that fits into the hollow of my palm, and between a half to a pint of water, depending on the need. Use less for young children and anyone who is weak and frail. Dried herbs have twice the strength of fresh herbs, so twice the amount of fresh herb is used. • As you make the tea, say thank you to the plant. This open-hearted attitude adds to the healing process. I like to picture the plant and affirm its healing qualities as I wait for the tea to brew, partly to affirm the healing I am engaged in and also as a memory aid. This way I keep learning and understanding more about the plants all the time and keep my knowledge strong. Many of the herbs are an acquired taste. Nurture an openness to these wild flavours and earthy tastes and give them a chance. More often than not, a taste you didn’t like at first becomes a taste that you find you love. These are also for adults only as they are a mixture of brandy and honey. This makes them a most delicious way to take your medicine! They are especially good to use when travelling as they are kept in small dropper bottles and taken neat. Elixirs are combination remedies, created for specific uses and personal needs. Elixirs need to taste good so the addition of any aromatic herbs improves the flavour, but must also support the over-all herbal action. They are experimental and fun, as well as being extremely effective and I like to give them creative names. Write up everything in your Herb Journal. This is especially important when you make combination elixirs. Recording the plants and proportions used is invaluable when you create something you want to repeat. Method one 1. Half fill a dark jar with a herb or combinations of herbs: tear the leaves, crush the seeds or fruit, and chop the roots. Send your thanks to the plants. Add a little of something that will give it a nice flavour such as rose petals, sweet violet, lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena etc, making sure that their actions support the overall use of the remedy. 2. Cover the plant matter with clear runny honey and send your silent thanks to the bees. Poke well with a chopstick to get out any trapped air bubbles and break the plant matter up further. 3. Then top the jar up with brandy and 4. Put on the lid and label, date and shake well. Give it a poke and a shake frequently and keep out of bright light. They are ready in about a month, although they come to no harm if they are left longer. 5. Strain off the plant matter and rebottle in clean dark dropper bottles. Pour a little boiling water over the mash of herbs that are left over, getting every last bit of goodness out of them. Toast the plant and its medicine and have your first taste before returning the spent mash to the earth with thanks. Method two Create an instant elixir using the tinctures you have made. 1. Using a jug combine several tinctures that support the remedy you are making. 2. Mix in a similar amount of honey to tincture and mix the two together. 3. Pour into dark dropper bottles. Name and date and write up in your herb journal. Their dosage is similar to tinctures, although I tend to use them little and often. Here are some suggestions of plants to choose from, depending on what you have available. I have listed the native plants first and the aromatics at the end. Anti-stress elixir Hawthorn, cowslip, vervain, rose petals, lavender, borage. Drops of calm Hawthorn, elderflowers, cowslip, hops, valerian, vervain, rose petals, borage, lavender, chamomile. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Letting in the Wild Edges, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"Growing my own mulch has long been a goal of mine. We use a lot of mulch in the nursery and garden and at the moment I have no problem sourcing straw but if/when the day comes that the farmers start using their own straw to improve their soil (which is becoming a more common practice), I’ll be needing to step up my mulch growing efforts. Currently, I grow enough mulch to sustain my perennial beds and around 10% of my annual beds but rely on imported straw for mulching the other 90% of annual vegetable and nursery beds. My ideal mulch plant grows fast, is drought tolerant, competes minimally with crop plants, does not contain seed that easily spreads, is easy to handle and cut, i.e. not thorny/prickly or tough and fibrous, and can biodegrade relatively quickly (thereby returning the nutrients back to soil). I’ve broadly categorized the main sources of mulch we produce in our 1500m2 garden. Aquatic plants
I grow emergent wetland species such us cattails (Typha spp), sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) on the banks of a small pond (6m x 3m), and within a grey water reed bed (1m x 6m). The pond also provides suitable habitat for hornworts (Ceratophyllum spp). a submerged rootless perennial that gathers on the surface en masse. This plant makes an excellent mulch being rich in nitrogen, growing very fast and is easy to position around the base of plants. The emergent species provide a good thick carbon rich mulch that helps to reduce evaporation on the terrestrial beds and I cut these back in the spring in case they are used for overwintering invertebrates. Aquatic plants are an excellent source of mulch as there are no issues with seed germinating amongst your land based crops. Tap rooted perennial / biennials
Deep rooted perennial plants tend to produce a good amount of biomass, are generally drought tolerant and do not compete strongly with our crop plants. I have found native biennial weeds such as greater burdock (Arctium lappa), a very useful mulch plant with the gigantic leaves growing back very fast after a cut. Lesser burdock (Arctium minus), is also useful albeit to lesser extent. Although biennial, if you cut back these plants before flowering you can prolong their life, harvesting good quantities of seed free biomass. I do eventually allow some of the plants to flower and they are much loved by bees among other insects. Comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum), ‘bocking 14’, is a classic example of a deep rooted mulch plant. We have the plant scattered throughout the garden and planted in dedicated patches. The plants do require irrigation however and will only provide good leaf yields if grown on fertile soil. Peeing on the plants is recommended. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), provide a great source of biomass. For a good tuber harvest it’s best to wait until the end of the season before harvesting the mulch. We can never consume as much as we produce of these tubers in the kitchen. I have found them to be much appreciated by our pigs and an excellent source of fresh winter food for our rabbits. Leaves of greater burdock (Arctium lappa) Nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs 
These plants take a while to establish but make an excellent contribution. I’ve had good results from coppicing empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), when they are 3-years-old and chop and dropping the soft new growth three or four times a year. I am expecting to also see good results from grey alder (Alnus incana) and Italian alder (Alnus cordata). I avoid using thorny nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs for this purpose. Annual trimming of shrubs such as autumn olive – Elaeagnus umbellata and broom – Cytisus scoparius also provides good quantities of mulch. Click here for more info on nitrogen fixing plants. Lawn and ground cover
One of my favourite sources of mulch is lawn trimmings. They are great for mulching potted plants or applying a mulch into tight spots. Mixed species lawns will contain a more diverse mix of mineral nutrients. Lawns including a legume such as white clover (Trifolim repens), can provide a nitrogen rich mulch. It’s a good idea to leave some of the trimmings behind to keep the lawn healthy. Autumn leaf fall and herbaceous stem residue
The annual shedding of leaves from trees and shrubs in our garden make a great contribution to our mulch capital. Leaves can be cleared from paths, lawns and wildflower beds (as they will disrupt the growth in these areas) and concentrated where they are of benefit such as the base of high demanding fruiting shrubs such as blackcurrants or blackberries. Herbaceous perennials such as lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis) and mints (Mentha spp). will provide dead stems annually. It’s always a good idea to leave hollow stems of some herbaceous perennials to remain for the winter as they are utilized by invertebrates for egg laying and hibernating. If the plant does not have a hollow stem it can be cut back and used for mulch. Fennel (Foeniculm vulgare), provides large quantities of biomass and as far as I can tell the stems are not utilised by any organism over the winter. In the vegetable garden all the remnants of my crops after harvesting go straight back to the surface for recycling. Foeniculum vulgare and other herbaceous perennials Tree prunings
Woody prunings from shrubs, trees and vines cut into small pieces (5-10cm) make good mulch in the mature areas of the forest garden with well established fungal soils specializing in breaking down the lignified woody material. Living mulches 
In the more mature areas of the garden where the trees have established (5yrs and older) I have dispensed with mulch all together in favour of ground cover plants that can be considered living mulches. Some the most successful perennial living mulches I have found that form good dense cover in the shade include bugle (Ajuga reptans), spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), Caucasian stonecrop (Sedem spurium), perwinkle (Vinca major) and betony (Stachys officinalis). Lamium maculatum spreading well under a mullbery (Morus alba) Scaling up mulch production
In order to grow enough mulch to provide a water retaining, weed excluding barrier for my annual and nursery beds I would certainly need more space. A larger wetland area would be ideal, with aquatic species growing very fast and the seed bearing parts of the plants being non problematic to use on terrestrial beds. If you don’t have a reliable aquatic habitat, the next best option for growing quantities of mulch without irrigation and fertilization is probably grass. During my next post I’ll be sharing a plan where using the lessons garnered from small scale systems, we’ll be growing mulch to support approx 670 fruit trees and 1360 soft fruit shrubs on a 5ha Agroforestry Project (design layout below).

"There are many medicinal uses for elder – Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae family). It is an evocative tree, steeped in history, tradition, and folklore. This is one of our great food and medicinal plants, easily found in most areas of the British Isles where people have settled. It’s botanical name, Sambucus nigra, stems from the Greek word sambuke; a ‘musical pipe’, due to its hollow form supplying our ancestors a perfect wood for making pipes. The Latin ‘nigra’, means black, in allusion to the dark colour of ripe elder berry fruit. Elder is a deciduous woodland and hedgerow plant, native to Northern Europe and North America, and can be seen happily growing on most types of soil up to altitudes of approximately 470m. Superstition says to not cut elder down or burn them. This may be purely because of the toxic fumes which rise from burning elder wood, or it may be that the faeries will be really upset because you are destroying such a useful plant! Other legends have grown around this plant, such as that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who allegedly betrayed Jesus to the Romans, then said to have hanged himself from its branches. This story gave rise to the name of the edible fungus found all year round on the elder – the Jelly Ear. Elder can sometimes be found growing as a shrubby form, and sometimes like a tree on a single trunk, similar to other woodland-edge plants like hazel, hawthorn and blackthorn. A mature elder typically displays a domed crown, and will be spotted from a distance once you know it. Elders can reach 8m or more, although more commonly 5-6m or so, because of other limiting environmental factors. Ideally the plant likes a rich and damp soil in a sunny position. Elder does not like exposed sites or windy hillsides. The branches display numerous lenticels (air holes) and produce their stems with opposite pairs of buds. The buds are naked, without bud scales. The light brown, corky bark pattern on elder can appear quite similar to the invasive exotic, the ‘butterfly bush’ – Buddleja davidii. The similarity between Sambucus and Buddleja ends there. Elder’s leaves are completely different in form. They are compound, comprising of seven oval, serrated leaflets, each being about 7-10cm long. The leaflets typically come in two or three opposite pairs with one terminal leaflet. They are a much lighter green colour than the Himalayan native ‘butterfly bush’ which has a simple, lanceolate / elliptical leaf. You will find this year’s flowers and fruits on last year’s growth. The umbel-like elderflowers, (technically corymbs), are borne on terminal stems. Five creamy-white petals surround the yellow anthers. When ripe, and picked on a sunny day, are bursting with pollen and scent, and should be a bright lemon-yellow. They turn brown when past their best. Only pick ripe flowers! The flowers have a small amount of natural yeast on them which assists fermentation when making drinks. This will be testified by anyone who makes the superb thirst quenching elderflower champagne! The rank smell of elder leaves or the gone-over flowers is known to repel many who come across it, often being described as a cat urine smell!  After a short but sweet period in full bloom, the flowers give rise to upstanding clusters of small berries, which are typically no bigger than 10mm in diameter. Initially green, the berries gradually begin to nod earthwards as they ripen. At the end of the summer they are dark purple – with many medicinal uses. Parts used Flowers, berries, leaves, bark, fungi. Harvest time The flowers are picked when in full bloom. The berries are picked when ripe in the autumn. Key active medicinal constituents Tannins, potassium, mucilage, phenols, triterpenes, sterols, lectins, flavonoids (including rutin). The dark coloured berries are rich in anthocyanins, folic acid and vitamins A and C. They also contain flavonoids, and cyanidin glucosides, which are poisonous in large doses.  Medicinal actions Diaphoretic, febrifuge, anti-catarrhal, anti viral, immuno-supportive. Uses – Elderflowers and berries are expectorant and diaphoretic, thus they help to manage and reduce fevers and to rid the body of toxins. – Elderflowers are also anti-viral and are useful in combating herpes simplex type 1 virus (responsible for cold sores). – The flowers can be made into champagne, cordials, wine, sorbet, jam and fritters. – Elderberry extract has been proven to inhibit various strains of flu, especially if taken early enough. Many people can testify that elder can significantly reduce recovery times from influenza. – Some books have stated the ripe berries are poisonous, but this is slightly misleading. They will cause gastric upset if you eat a large quantity raw, (as will too many apples while scrumping) but in small amounts they should present no problem. Cooked into jams, syrups etc., larger quantities of elderberries are absolutely fine. – Pioneering contemporary forager-chefs have rediscovered that even the green berries can be used, as ‘capers’, if prepared correctly. This involves fermenting the berries in a salt brine solution for a few days, similar to preparing green walnuts for pickling, and then covering in a flavoured vinegar. – Even when the tree is dormant in the winter, it is still possible to harvest food! The ‘Jelly ear’ fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is often found on elder, dead or alive. Known as a delicacy in China, it is best cooked sliced into thin strips, in a spicy, oriental-style soup.

"There’s a plethora of info out there about comfrey but not much detail regarding establishing and managing a comfrey patch so I thought I would write an article to share my experience on this and how we grow comfrey as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden. A member of the borage family, comfrey – Symphytum spp. is native to Europe and Asia and there are 40 recorded species throughout that region. The plant most commonly referred to and used in gardens is Russian comfrey – Symphytum x uplandicum, a naturally occurring hybrid of two wild species: common comfrey – Symphytum officinale and prickly comfrey – Symphytum asperum. A few centuries back, the hybrid Symphytum x uplandicum came to the attention of Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) and he widely promoted the plant as a food and forage crop. Years later, and after two world wars, Lawrence D Hills (1911-1991) would continue Henry Doubleday’s Comfrey crusade. In the 1950s, Hills developed a comfrey research program in the village of Bocking, near Braintree in the UK. The original trial site is on the plot of land now occupied by the Doubleday Gardens housing development. Lawrence Hills lived at 20 Convent Lane just around the corner of the trial site. At this site, Hills trialed at least 21 comfrey ‘strains’, each one named after the village Bocking. Strain 14 was identified as being the most nutrient rich, non-seeding strain and ‘Bocking 14’ began its journey into gardens far and wide across the world. (Learn more its history on the Balkan Ecology Project blog.) Medicinal – Comfrey has been cultivated as a healing herb since at least 400BC. The Greeks and Romans commonly used comfrey to stop heavy bleeding, treat bronchial problems and heal wounds and broken bones. Poultices were made for external wounds and tea was consumed for internal ailments. Comfrey has been reported to promote healthy skin with its mucilage content that moisturizes and soothes and promotes cell proliferation. This plant is my first port of call if ever I need to dress a wound. Simply take a few leaves brush them together to remove the hairs and wrap them around the wound and apply light pressure. It’s incredibly effective at stopping the bleeding, reducing the pain and healing the wound. Biomas – Comfrey produces large amounts of foliage from late May (late spring) until hard frosts in October or November (late autumn). The plant is excellent for producing mulch and can be cut from 2-5 times per year depending on how well the plants are watered and fed. The plant grows rapidly after each harvest. In our gardens we have Comfrey ‘Bocking 14’ located next to each fruit tree in order to have a renewable source of mulch just where we need it. We also grow in patches as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden and have patches in the wildflower meadows (details below). We’ve supplied 1,000 ‘Bocking 14’ cuttings to Oxygenisis, a business in Germany who are experimenting with using this plant for carbon capture. Mineral dam – Comfrey has deep roots of up to 2m that utilize nutrients deep in the subsoil that would otherwise wash away with the underground soil water or remain inaccessible to other plants. The nutrients, once taken up from the roots, are relocated throughout the plant as and where needed with some of them ending up in the comfrey leaf mass. When cutting the leaf mass and applying to the soil surface, the mined nutrients are returned and again made accessible to shallower rooted crop plants.  Biodiversity – The bell shaped flowers provide nectar and pollen to many species of bees and other insects from late May until the first frosts in late autumn. Lacewings are said to lay eggs on comfrey and spiders overwinter on the plant. Parasitoid wasps and spiders will hunt on and around comfrey. Pest and disease prevention and control – Research indicates that a comfrey solution can be used to prevent powdery mildew. Pest predators such as spiders, lacewings and parasatoid wasps associate with this plant. It’s best to leave some plants alone in order to sustain pest predator relationships. Ground cover – Some species can quickly spread to form a thick ground cover and work particularly well for ground cover on the sunny side under shrubs and trees. Symphytum tuberosum – Tuberous Comfrey seems to be the best species for this.  Fertilizer – Comfrey leaves contain a great balance of major plant nutrients (N,P,K) and can be fed to plants as powder, direct mulch or by steeping chopped comfrey leaves in water for several weeks to produce a thick, dark liquid that can be diluted with water and applied to plant roots. More on this below. Nutritional value of comfrey – You can see from the below table that wilted comfrey contains significantly higher quantities of potash compared to other organic fertilizers. It’s well recorded that comfrey is an excellent source of potassium (K) a major plant nutrient that is required by plants in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction. Animal fodder – Comfrey has a long history for use as an animal feed. Lawrence D Hills dedicated books to this topic.* The leaves are best received by animals wilted. Fresh leaves can be eaten by pigs, sheep, and poultry but cattle, rabbits and horses will only consume wilted leaves. Human consumption – Symphytum officianale and Symphytum x uplandicum are both reported to be used for salad and potherb and are best when cooked. Personally I’m not keen on the texture but will have the occasional nibble from the garden using the new growth to mix in a spring green salad. Caution – Although comfrey has been used as a food crop, in the past 20 years scientific studies reported that comfrey may be carcinogenic, since it appeared to cause liver damage and cancerous tumors in rats. These reports have temporarily restricted development of comfrey as a food crop. In light of this, the regular consumption of comfrey is not advisable.  Life cycle – Herbaceous perennial Growth habit – Comfrey begins growth in early-April and by early May compact clusters of young leaves are visible in the crown of the old plant. Within a few weeks, the leaf blades with long petioles have grown to over 35cm high. Basal leaves are large, lance-shaped, stalked, and coarsely hairy. The leaves die back following the first frost and remain dormant for winter. Many species can spread vigorously via seed and are generally not welcome in the garden because of this. Other species can spread via tubers and all species quickly regenerate from broken root pieces.  Flowering – Starts in late May or early June and continues until the first frost in late autumn. The bell-shaped flowers with pedicels are in terminal cymes or one-sided clusters. Flowers of common comfrey are usually creamy yellow, but white, red, or purple types have been found in Europe. Prickly comfrey has pink and blue flowers while Russian comfrey has blue, purple, or red-purple flowers. Tuberous comfrey has creamy white flowers. Vegetative growth does not cease with the start of flowering, and the plant will add new stems continuously during the growing season. Most comfrey plants can be somewhat invasive, spreading via seed to parts of the garden where they are not wanted. ‘Bocking 14’ will flower and provide nectar and pollen but will not produce viable seed. Roots – Some species have short, thick, tuberous roots such as Symphytum tuberosum. Others such as Symphytum x uplandicum have deep and expansive root systems. Light – Needs full sun for good biomass production but grows fine in the shade. Shade – Tolerates light shade (about 50%). Moisture – Some species are drought tolerant e.g. Symphytum tuberosum. Cultivated plants require irrigation. USDA Hardiness Zone – 4-9 comfrey crowns and roots are very winter hardy.  Soil – Comfrey is adaptable to many soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils.  pH – Tolerates a wide range (6.5-8.5), although not very sensitive to soil pH, highest yields are reported to occur on soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Perhaps you’re interested in growing comfrey to feed your animals, for medicine, for mulch, for compost or you’re slightly masochistic and want to roll around naked in the pricky beds of biomass (not me). In any case, here’s how to do it. The plant we use in our gardens is Symphytum x uplandicum – ‘Bocking 14’. A sterile cultivar that produces copious quantities of nutrient dense biomass. The following information is based on using this plant.  Choosing the site – We’re growing for biomass and want the plants to receive as much light as possible. Accordingly, we lay out our beds on an east to west axis (we’re in the northern hemisphere).  Irrigation is necessary if you want to get good yields from the plants so picking a place with access to irrigation is of paramount important.  In areas of low rainfall, using the gradient of the land to channel precipitation towards your beds will reduce the water needs of your plants. In areas of high rainfall with a high water table you should consider diverting water away from the beds. Once established, comfrey is difficult to get rid of, so choose a site where you want it to stay. Don’t plant comfrey in any area you cultivate, as the broken root pieces quickly establish into new plants and can out compete slower growing crops.  Position comfrey downhill from where you expect leachate to be present, i.e downhill from a manure pile , compost heap, outside toilet, animal pen etc., can provide passive fertility to the plants and rescue otherwise lost minerals from draining away with the sub soil ground water. 
Grow the comfrey where you want to use it. As you’ll see later we may be harvesting over 1/4 ton biomass from our patch and don’t want to be carrying that over long distances. Preparing the site – Raised beds are a major part of our fertility strategy and overtime retain water and nutrients very efficiently. I use 1.3m wide beds surrounded by 50cm paths for our crops as this allows easy access for harvesting everywhere in the beds without ever having to tread on the soil and the paths are wise enough to take our lawnmower. To form a bed, the area should be cleared of all plants, which is best achieved by sheet mulching the season before. Pernicious perennials or tap rooted biennials should be dug out. After you have cleared the whole area, mark out the bed shape with string and dig out 50cm wide paths around your beds, applying the soil to the surface of the planting area and thereby creating the initial rise of the bed. Fork over the beds well. If a hardpan is present take the time and effort to eliminate it before planting. Depending on the quality of your soil you may want to add extra compost before planting into the bed. If you have sheet mulched the area before hand, with the additional soil from the paths all you need to do is add a good 20cm thick straw mulch (or some other mulch) and it’s ready for planting. A good mulch to start with will help keep the weeds down while your comfrey gets going. You can alter the depth and gradient of the paths to facilitate the required direction of water movement. Planting material – You can plant out with crown divisions or root cuttings best done in the spring when the soil has warmed. A crown division can be obtained from simply putting a spade through the center of a mature comfrey plant and transplanting the divided sections. For our beds, I divided two year old plants into quarters, sometimes sixths, and these established very well in the first year. It’s bests not to harvest the leaf biomass in the first year in order to allow a deep root system to develop. However if you use large divisions you can start harvesting in July. Root cuttings are a great way to plant out large areas of comfrey. The cuttings should be grown on in small pots with 50% compost 50% river sand mix kept moist and planted out in the spring as soon as the first leaves emerge and the soil has warmed. If you are planting large numbers of root cuttings you can plant directly into the beds by creating ‘nests’ in the straw, adding two cupped handfuls of the above mentioned potting mix and plant the cuttings into this. Keep them moist like a wrung out sponge and the success rate will be very close to 100%. Spacing – The plants should be spaced 60cm apart in rows and 60cm apart at diagonals between rows. Plant the rows 15cm from the edge of the beds. Cutting – In the first year allow the plants to establish so that the roots develop well and penetrate deep into the subsoil. Remove any weeds around the plants leaving them on the surface. The following year the cutting can begin. You can scythe the beds for a quick harvest or cut each plant individually with a pair of secateurs or shears cutting to 5cm or so from ground level. The leaves are prickly so if you have sensitive hands wear gloves. Cut the comfrey as the flowering stalks emerge up to four times a year. Allow the plants to flower at least once during the season to provide bee fodder to a range of native bees and honey bees. Leave the last flush of leaves before the winter so that invertebrates can find winter shelter in the undergrowth. You may need to weed between cuts every now and then but generally the comfrey will quickly cover the surface. Feeding – After you have cut the comfrey, mow the pathways between the beds and empty the trimmings to the base of the comfrey plants. Any trimmings from lawns and hedges in the surrounding area can also be used. We are experimenting with growing nitrogen fixing hedging and ground cover plants adjacent to the patch in order to feed our comfrey. A most excellent comfrey feed is undiluted urine applied at a rate of approx 500 ml per plant twice per growing season. Irrigation – Comfrey will produce more biomass if irrigated and in dry climates it’s essential to irrigate. Comfrey plants wilt very fast in hot conditions and will stop photosynthesising at this point. Twenty litres per m2 per week of drought should be more than adequate. The beauty of biological systems are that, if managed properly, each year the soils improve and the ability of the soil to store water will improve over time. We use passive irrigation diverting water from a mountain stream into the paths around the beds. The paths fill with water, we raise the level by blocking the low points with sacks of sawdust and the water is drawn throughout the soil via capillary action. Passive irrigation in our market garden. The paths fill with water and the water permeates throughout the soil via capillary action. As mulch – Freshly cut comfrey leaves make good mulch because they have high nitrogen content, and don’t pull nitrogen from the soil while decomposing. Comfrey’s high potassium content makes it especially beneficial for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, berries, and fruit trees. With adequate feed and watering we’ve seen yields of 2-3kg of biomass per plant per cut. Comfrey beds establishing well. This bed was planted with divided crowns 5 months prior to this photo being taken. Liquid fertliser – What I like to call ‘Comfert’. Fill a barrel, preferably with a bottom tap and a gauze on the inside (to prevent clogging) about 3/4 full with freshly cut comfrey and add water to fill the barrel. Cover it, and let it steep for 3-6 weeks. The smell from the resulting liquid is far from attractive so approach with caution. The tea may be used full strength or diluted by half or more. Don’t apply before heavy rain is forecast as most of the nutrients suspended in the liquid will wash straight through the soil. For the best results apply the feed to your vegetables when they are in most need of the extra fertility. This will be different for each crop, for example, tomatoes are best fed when they are setting fruit and then any time during the fruiting period. Applying comfert before this can be counter productive and make your plants more susceptible to pest problems. The black slurry at the bottom of the barrel can be dispersed evenly back over the comfrey patch. Liquid fertilizer concentrate – ‘Comfert Plus’ can also be made by packing fresh-cut comfrey tops into an old bucket, weighing them down with something heavy, covering tightly, and waiting a few weeks for them to decompose into a black slurry. You can put a hole in the bottom of the bucket and collect the concentrate in another container as it drips out. Dilute this comfrey concentrate about 15 to 1 with water, and use as you would comfert. You can seal this concentrate in plastic jugs until you are ready to use it. Warning! Comfert stinks like hell. My nieces came to visit from London last year and offered to help out in the market garden. One of the tasks that day was to apply comfert to the crops. Let’s just say it did not end well and we had a much better experience taking softwood cuttings the next day. According to Martin Crawford in Creating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops, one cut of comfrey from one plant contains 0.5g of Nitrogen (N) and 10g of potassium (K) to crops. Based on this I calculated how much Potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and biomass the 13 m2 comfrey patch can potentially produce in a year. Below is a table indicating how many comfrey cuts are needed to meet the Nitrogen and Potassium needs of various moderate and heavy cropping fruit and nut trees and annual vegetables. In the 1960s, Lawrence D. Hills used UK gardeners records for a comfrey report. (See the Balkan Ecology Project blog for the results.) Based on these records I calculated a yield of approx. 5.5kg of biomass per plant each year. Using this figure one of our beds should produce approx 286kg of biomass. We shall see as this year we begin our own records. We’re looking to gather some solid data on how comfrey performs in our climate and we’ll be recording the yields from our patch starting this season and for at least the next five years. For more info on our record keeping and research programs see Polyculture Market Garden Study. If you would like to join the ‘who can grow the most comfrey’ experiment and contribute data to our records, send us an email. It will be great to have records from all over the world.

"Hugelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, means hill culture or hill mound. Instead of putting branches, leaves and grass clippings in bags by the curbside for the bin men… build a hugel bed. Simply mound logs, branches, leaves, grass clippings, straw, cardboard, petroleum-free newspaper, manure, compost or whatever other biomass you have available, top with soil and plant your veggies. The advantages of a hugel bed are many, including: The gradual decay of wood is a consistent source of long-term nutrients for the plants. A large bed might give out a constant supply of nutrients for 20 years (or even longer if you use only hardwoods). The composting wood also generates heat which should extend the growing season. Soil aeration increases as those branches and logs break down… meaning the bed will be no till, long term. The logs and branches act like a sponge. Rainwater is stored and then released during drier times. Actually you may never need to water your hugel bed again after the first year (except during long term droughts). Sequester carbon into the soil. On a sod lawn Sepp Holzer (hugelkultur expert) recommends cutting out the sod, digging a one foot deep trench and filling the trench with logs and branches. Then cover the logs with the upside down turf. On top of the turf add grass clippings, seaweed, compost, aged manure, straw, green leaves, mulch, etc…  Sepp Holzer recommends steep hugel beds to avoid compaction from increased pressure over time. Steep beds mean more surface area in your garden for plants and the height makes easy harvesting. The greater the mass, the greater the water-retention benefits. Hugel bed dug in clay with logs put in vertically, next branches and lots of wood chips. Top 6 inches will be wood chips and dirt. This bed will store water and give nutrients for many years to come. Straw bale gardens require less soil, less water and hold heat. As the straw breaks down nutrients feed the plants. Combining a straw surround with a hugel interior, topped by lasagne layering is an excellent idea for an area with poor quality soil. Hugel bed in Ontario, Canada (June 28th) by Tim Burrows. Tim surrounded his very tall hugel bed in pallets! Sheet mulching (lasagne gardening) is like composting in place. Above: just a suggestion as to sheet mulching layers. Nitrogen-rich material such as fresh grass clippings or green leaves put right on the hugelkultur wood would help jump start the composting process. Could also include seaweed, straw, dead leaves, leaf mould, etc.

The first year of break down means the wood (and fungi) steal a lot of the nitrogen out of the surrounding environment, so adding nitrogen during the first year or planting crops that add nitrogen to the soil (like legumes) or planting species with minimal nitrogen requirements is necessary, unless there is plenty of organic material on top of the wood. After the wood absorbs nitrogen to its fill, the wood will start to break down and start to give nitrogen back in the process. In the end you will be left with a beautiful bed of nutrient rich soil. Tree types that work well in hugelkultur:
Hardwoods break down slowly and therefore your hugel bed will last longer, hold water for more years and add nutrients for more years. But softwoods are acceptable as well, a softwood bed will just disintegrate quicker. Mixing woods with softwoods and branches on top, to give off nutrients first, and hardwoods on bottom, sounds like a plan if you have access to multiple types of wood. Yet the newly decomposing softwoods at the top will eat up a lot of nitrogen at first, so compensate for that.

Woods that work best:
Alders, apple, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, oak, poplar, willow (make sure it is dead or it will sprout).

Trees types that work okay:
Black cherry (use only rotted), camphor wood (well aged), cedar/juniper/yew (anti-microbial/anti-fungal, so use only at very bottom or unless already well-aged. Cedar should be broken down before new plant roots reach it), eucalyptus (slightly anti-microbial), osage orange (exceptionally resistant to decay), Pacific yew (exceptionally resistant to decay), pine/fir/spruce (tannins and sap), red mulberry (exceptionally resistant to decay).

Tree types to avoid:
Black locust (will not decompose), black walnut (juglone toxin), old growth redwood (heartwood will not decompose and redwood compost can prevent seed germination).

"Thistles are a bane of picnickers and campers. Who hasn’t trodden on the sharp, unforgiving spines of a thistle when out and about barefoot in grasslands? For many people, relationships with thistles have generally been painful and irritable, but now you can get your own back! One of the great things about thistles is that every single species is edible, so this is great news for foraging beginners! Even the closest lookalikes found here are edible – the sow thistles (Sonchus spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), so when working with the thistles, you can learn to identify and proceed to experiment with complete confidence from the outset. We have at least 14 species of thistle growing wild in the UK, mostly from the Cirsium (aka plume thistles) and Carduus genera. Thistles are found in numerous settings all over our islands and can be a useful soil barometer. Often their presence signifies that the land is fertile, and in many instances, neglected. I eat from a number of different species. These are: creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis), spear thistle (C. vulgare), woolly thistle (C. eriophorum), marsh thistle (C. palustris), and welted thistle (Carduus acanthoides syn C. crispus). As you will discover, plants that have spines to offer protection against predators, have no real need for bitterness. Spear thistle It’s almost impossible to misidentify a thistle. One of the easy-to-spot botanical differences between thistles and their numerous relatives in the daisy family, is that the overlapping bracts (involucre) found directly below the flowers of thistles, are always spiny. Simple! The leaves of the numerous species will differ in size, shape and the density of spine coverage. Most have stiff spines on the margins, but some have soft prickles. You need to discover for yourself which are the more tactile! When in flower, most thistles produce a lovely purple / mauve bloom, but some species are known for their yellow inflorescence (cabbage thistle – Cirsium oleraceum and the Carline thistle – Carlina vulgaris). In all of the thistles, flowers give way to copious amounts of fluffy hairs (pappus) attached to their tiny fruits, superbly designed for air-borne dispersal. A distinguishing feature between the two main generais that Cirsium spp. produce feathered pappus hairs, whereas Carduus spp. only have simple pappus hairs. Creeping thistle produces dense spines on its leaves, but very few spines or hairs on the flowering stems. Spear thistle has large, deeply-lobed leaves with large spines at the margins, as well as hairy, spiny stems. Marsh thistle looks somewhat like spear thistle at an initial glance, but without the large spines and leaf lobes, and usually with a thin, red, leaf margin. Woolly thistle is easily identifiable with large, deeply-lobed, evenly-shaped leaves, and very large flower heads, wrapped in a ‘cobweb’ of cotton-like hairs. This particular species is the largest wild thistle I use, although if you have milk thistle (Silybum marianum) growing in your plot, you can use that too, but you will need good gloves to protect yourself from its long spiny flower heads! Eating milk thistle chokes would of course prevent you harvesting the exceptional liver-supportive medicine found in the seeds. Wooly thistle Creeping thistle will grow in all manner of waste-ground, grasslands, verges and field edges. I also see a lot of spear thistle in similar habitats, although when found in grassland, it’s not as abundant as the creeping species. The root systems explain why; spear thistle has a tap root, whereas creeping thistle grows on rhizomes. The marsh thistle, as its name alludes to, likes damp conditions such as fens, marshes, canal tow-paths and riversides. Woolly thistle is a little bit more selective in its choice of soil and setting, preferring calcareous ground. It too enjoys grasslands. Welted thistle can be found all over the UK, especially loving clay soils. Go prepared! Stiff gloves and a knife are required. Harvest the best leaf mid-ribs in spring when growth is plentiful and quick. Your specimens will be tender and sweeter. Flowering stems will appear from late spring through into autumn. I only consider harvesting from plants whose flower buds are yet to really begin unfurling. Flower buds (chokes) are available all summer. In Portugal, a number of thistle species are still collected in spring and sold at markets. A recent academic study highlighted the nutritional value from eating thistles. The findings are contained within ‘Ethnobotany In The New Europe’ by Manuel. P de Santayana et al. (Eds), published June 2010. In the study, researchers noted the wide range of thistle species collected, and concentrated on the nutritional value of one particular thistle (Scolymus hispanicus – Spanish or golden thistle). This plant is collected by villagers in various areas of the countryside. Bunches of the stripped leaf mid-ribs are sold and bought in a number of markets in different areas. Levels of certain nutrients were analysed and compared to some commonly consumed vegetables. Their findings show that the thistle contained consistently higher levels of important major nutrients than some of our commonly consumed cultivated vegetables. Weight for weight, thistles come out higher in fibre, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc and other nutrients. Is it likely that the thistles found wild here will be similarly endowed with a range of important vitamins and minerals? I’m more than happy to work on the assumption that this will be the case. Many other wild plant species are known to contain high concentrations of important nutrients. Preparing thistles is pretty easy. Simply choose the most tender specimens. If using the petioles, then cut and strip all the spines off, before peeling the outer, fibrous layer from the stalk. Use raw as crudités, pickle or ferment them, or chop into salads and serve them with a tangy vinaigrette. If cooking, they don’t require long! Preparing the stems is similar, but they are hollow. These can be used in similar ways to the petioles, or you can stuff them, roast them, and braise them. As relatives of the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), thistles produce edible, if smaller, ‘chokes’. These are the crunchy, immature bases, or capitulum, of the composite flower-head. As you would do with globe artichokes, peel away the bracts to get to the prize. I only choose the largest wild species for this. Happy foraging!

"Some plants seem to be our constant companions, no matter where we live. Often, they will also be some of our really useful species. It will soon become clear that the common mallow (Malva sylvestris) is one of these plants. Rather than being looked upon as a weed, the mallows can be more usefully described as some of our gloriously abundant plant helpers. A number of mallow species have long been used as a food and medicine, wherever they are found native, and especially in the Middle East and Asia. You won’t have far to go to find the common mallow in most parts of Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia either. Common mallow can be found growing erect or prostrate, which may initially cause confusion because it’s easy to assume they might be two different species. Mallow’s kidney-shaped or palmately-lobed leaves are notably creased, typically with dentate margins. The leaves often show a purple spot in the centre of the base of the leaf and this can also be seen to run down the petiole on some specimens. On other specimens, the purple spotting and colouring is completely absent. Mallow leaves have long petioles. Their deep green foliage hints at a renowned drought tolerance. During flowering, the leaves appear alternately on the stems. Holding a leaf relays the surface coarseness. But tear and crush one, and you discover a family pattern – the mucilage. You will soon experience a slimy and tacky feel between your fingers. All parts of the plant contain mucilage. In bloom, the Malvaceae family plants produce five large notched petals in each open flower. Common mallow has showy pink petals laced with darker-coloured strokes. In the centre of the flower lies a pollen-loaded column of fused stamens. This surrounds the stigma, which rises above the column.  Mallow is known to freely seed. The round seed pods, known as ‘cheeses’, soon follow flowering. These were once munched by children on their way to and from school. The pods are held on stalks, close to the flowering stem. Mallow will be found on most soils, from coastal to marginally upland habitats, with most settings being adequate for this resilient plant. It loves waste-ground as well as grassland; gravel as much as coastal edges, and waysides and roadsides as well as hedges.  Leaves, flowers, seed pods, roots. Leaves, in spring; flowers from late spring; seed pods from early summer. Roots could be harvested from larger rosettes whenever large enough. Medicinal and nutritional constituents Vitamins A,B,C,E; inulin; mucilage; phenols; flavonoids; essential fatty acids; fibre; calcium; magnesium; zinc; selenium; potassium. Traditional and contemporary uses As with many wild food plants, the common mallow has also had a long history of medicinal use. Due to its high mucilage content, mallows make excellent soothing demulcent herbs, especially for cases of inflammation, either for the urinary, digestive or respiratory systems. Pregnant women or new mothers may like to know that mallow leaves can provide useful amounts of iron, as well as being quite high in zinc and most vitamins.  All of the mallow family with exception to the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum), are reportedly edible. With their high mucilage content, the leaves can usefully be taken as an emergency antidote to irritation or burning that may be caused by the accidental consumption of acrid plants in the buttercup family. Creative cooks can substitute mallow for spinach in many dishes, including soups, salads, gnocchi and quiche. I have even flash-fried larger mallow leaves for just one second in hot oil to make ‘popadoms’. Mallow also makes a great addition to soups, whereby the mucilage helps to thicken them.  In Jewish culture, mallow has been been considered the ‘most important plant in local gather society’. Every spring mallow is gathered in the countryside. Its common name in both Hebrew and Arabic, translates to ‘bread’.  During the war of 1948, when Jerusalem was under siege, mallow was an important famine crop, and one that is still celebrated on Independence day every year with a traditional dish made from mallow leaves. Common mallow can be substituted for the family relative Corchorus olitorius aka ‘jutes mallow’, when making the Egyptian / Middle-Eastern dish ‘Molokhia’. This traditional dish is usually served with chicken.  In China, mallow roots are a popular and a common ingredient in making hearty, yet medicinally potent soups and broths. The inulin-rich tap roots of a number of different mallow species, including common mallow, have been used. The seed pods can be substituted for most of the egg white if wanting to make mallow meringues. Simply boil up the peeled seed pods using 3 parts water 1 part seed pods, and reduce the liquid by half. For every half cup of liquid add one egg white, ¼ tsp of cream of tartar, some vanilla and castor sugar, then whip it up until foamy and stiff, just like meringues.  21st Century Foraging  The Medicinal Forest Garden  The Fast Wild Food Cookbookby Johnny Jumbalaya  Amazing Moringa: Medicinal, Edible & Easy to Grow  How to Make your own Sloe Gin Chris Hope, aka Chris Phyto, was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic plant lover, forager and teacher, who sadly died in 2021.";Permaculture Magazine UK

An oven dish approximately 25 x 25cm (10 x 10in) Preheat the oven to 180oC fan (200oC/400oF/gas mark 6). Finely chop the garlic and mix into the olive oil. Add a little pepper, stir and leave to infuse. Slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways into 5mm thick slices. Pour some olive oil into the pan and soften the onions, garlic and celery on a low heat.  When cooked, add the red pepper, beans and tomatoes. Simmer for around 15 minutes until the sauce is cooked through. Meanwhile, drizzle olive oil onto a griddle and cook the aubergines and courgettes, several slices at a time, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Pour some of the tomato sauce into the oven dish, add a layer of aubergine, then more sauce, a layer of courgette, and so on until the dish is filled with layers of sauce, aubergine and courgette. Decorate with slices of tomato. Put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Slice the bread so the knife goes about 90% through the loaf, leaving the base intact and the slices attached to each other. Put in a baking dish and, using a spoon, drizzle the garlic oil over both sides of each slice.  15 minutes before the lasagne is ready, put the bread in the oven. When the lasagne is cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the crusty garlic bread and a large salad, or dish of steamed seasonal green vegetables. Tip – Frying pan will work if you don’t have a griddle. This recipe adapts well to other vegetables. In the winter, use slices of cooked potato, parsnip, sweet potato or squash. Cooked whole cabbage and kale leaves make lovely ‘lasagne sheets’ too.  The Creative Kitchenby Stephanie Hafferty  No Dig Organic Home and Gardenby Stephanie Hafferty and Charles Dowding  Seasonal Pesto and Hummus Recipes  Growing Winter Salads Stephanie Hafferty is a no dig gardener, writer and author of The Creative Kitchen and coauthor of No Dig Organic Home and Garden.";Permaculture Magazine UK
"My name is Suzanne Pendleton and I live in Swinton, Salford (UK) and have been involved in the Greater Manchester Swift Street initiative since August 2024, which has been led by the RSPB. During lockdown I started to value my time outside as so many families did too. I enjoyed time in our little garden more and spotted some birds as they zoomed and screamed over the house. I wasn’t quite sure what they were and asked my friend Kathleen who lived on a surrounding road what they might be. She enlightened me. They were Swifts, a species recently added to the UK’s Red List of birds, meaning they are now amongst our most threatened. Then the summer was over and the swifts left Swinton heading back to Africa.  Each year since, I have eagerly anticipated the return of the Swifts. My understanding grew and I learnt of their declining numbers, now less than 60,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Along with developing a stiff neck constantly looking up to the sky, watching their incredible aerial manoeuvres.  I am privileged to live in a friendly neighbourhood on our lane. The community are always up for helping, and we pull together to help each other. We have a community messaging service which came into its own in lockdown, and continues to be a fabulous way to share information and request help and advice. During the last few years I had messaged our community group and asked if anyone knew about our Swifts and where they were nesting. Initially we were unsuccessful in understanding, but in spring 2024 we struck lucky and finally worked out the eaves where they lived. I’d also discovered Swift Mapper (an app for recording the location of Swift nesting sites) enabling us to understand we had four nest sites on the Lane and surrounding roads.  We also realised that there was another small colony locally less that 1/4 mile away. Last August, a resident of this local road got in touch to say Roshni (Parmar-Hill, Community Engagement Officer) from the RSPB had been to visit their colony. She asked if we’d be interested in getting involved with developing our Swift Street – thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery – and I eagerly accepted the offer. We used our community messaging group to share the news of the Swift Street development and I was overwhelmed by the local response. So many families were keen to help our Swift population, with more than 80 boxes requested. I think the consensus was that we are so privileged that these incredible urban birds choose our lane as their home, and as their nesting places can be threatened by redevelopment, having the opportunity to install boxes is a wonderful chance to do something proactive to help.  Roshni and I visited local homes who had expressed interest, helping families select potential sites for their boxes to be positioned. With Roshni’s guidance we talked about what Swifts need and I and residents began to understand more about how Swifts live. They are remarkably compatible with humans, don’t need a bird bath, bird table etc. as they feed on insects on the wing. I discovered along with other residents that the best way we could help our Swifts was to protect their current nesting sites, add boxes for more birds to nest in and to do all we could to support insect populations. For example, considering planting in our gardens to promote insect life, adopting No Mow May and not using insecticides. Those who weren’t able to install a box could instead help in other ways, so this made the project accessible for all – everyone could join in. Next came the production of the boxes. Roshni contacted local colleges and we were thrilled when a local skills centre suggested their joinery students could make these free of charge. Production began and numbers of those interested had grown as the message about the project spread, and so 100 boxes were produced.  Meanwhile, local guiding groups learnt of the initiative and Roshni visited the groups that I lead, as Brown Owl – 90 girls and young women were keen to learn about Swifts and how they could help. The groups were already keen to learn about environmental matters, and this project really whetted their appetite. The Brownies, Guides and Rangers designed posters, made seed bombs and grew in their understanding of our Swifts. Once the production of the boxes was finished the Brownies, Rangers and Guides got stuck into painting them with an environmentally friendly product which would protect the boxes, and a local lady Haldis (a RSPB Swift Champion, a voluntary role which supports local conservation efforts to protect the species) made the nest cups which would be inserted into each box.  We arrived at installation day on Saturday 8th March, with 25 boxes going up on that first day. By the end of March, 80 had been erected by a local roofer, Ryan. Of course, we needed to celebrate the returning of our precious Swifts and so we began planning our community event. Volunteers came forward from the surrounding roads and we met in a resident’s kitchen each Wednesday, so all could contribute ideas. Other local guiding groups wanted to contribute and so they made nature-themed bunting, and we were thrilled when the church on the lane offered their venue as a space for us to celebrate. The local dance and drama group wanted to be involved and so their leaders and young people planned songs and a drama production with poetry. And as if we weren’t already exciting enough, we then heard the news that RSPB Ambassador Megan McCubbin would love to come along to formally open our Swift Street.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on 17th May, with a fantastic community event. Sixty families made bee hotels, children had Swift-themed face paint, and a plant swap was popular. RSPB provided and led crafts, and local artists supported youngsters to make Swift puppets. More than 300 residents attended and watched the young people perform. The ribbon was cut revealing a beautiful Swift Street banner created by a local artist, alongside Swift boxes 99 and 100 positioned proudly on the front of the church. And yes, we had Swifts soaring high above us all day (perhaps watching the proceedings?) to the delight of the watching children and residents. As the street party continued into the evening we couldn’t believe our eyes when a ‘banger’ (a young Swift, which gets its name from its tendency to bang against prospective nest to check if they’re occupied or not) attempted to enter one of the newly positioned boxes. A perfect end to a fabulous day.  It’s been an absolute honour to be involved in this project and I feel so lucky that our community have been able to do something practical to support our local Swifts.

"We are delighted to announce the recipients of the 2025 Permaculture Magazine Award, in collaboration with Lush Spring Prize. Four projects have been awarded from a fund of £25,000. The Permaculture Magazine Award is a celebration of the vital work of permaculture projects from around the world. The Permaculture Magazine Award was established in 2018 to celebrate the vital work of permaculture projects around the world. To date (May 2025) it has awarded 28 projects with over £155,000. The award has received hundreds of applications, and it is a privilege to highlight this vital regenerative work that is world changing. Coordinating a network of permaculture centres, NGO Permaculture Ukraine offers training, events and educational resources across Ukraine, also ensuring accessibility for internally displaced people (IDP) and former military personnel. The organisation was founded following the first Permaculture Design Course (PDC) in Ukraine in 2011, and has held at least one PDC annually, actively seeking funding to make training accessible to vulnerable groups. Following the full-scale invasion in 2022, its focus expanded to include: The 14 permaculture centres provide training, shelter for IDPs and war-abandoned animals, and rehabilitation for children and adults. Its designers also create communal projects, including schools and homes for disabled people. Despite air raids and blackouts, NGO Permaculture Ukraine successfully hosted a two-day permaculture festival in Kyiv’s botanical garden in September 2024, drawing 100 participants eager to engage with top regenerative practitioners. NGO Permaculture Ukraine empowers Ukrainians for sustainable living and transformative change. Through active social media engagement and collaborations with ecovillages, zero-waste networks, and other ecological movements, it extends its influence and inspires a growing audience to adopt permaculture principles for Ukraine’s regeneration. https://permaculture.in.ua Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Since its founding in 2021, Battmung has: Recognising the importance of connecting people, Battmung also contributed to the founding of the Permaculture Institute of Korea (P.I.K) in 2023. Its goal is to organise its regional network and regenerate South Korea through permaculture, restoring soil, food chains, ecological awareness, and local economies. www.instagram.com/battmung.log Eco Centro Allpa Tarpuna works for the regeneration of degraded lands, food sovereignty and community autonomy, with a focus on indigenous communities in Ecuador. Founded in 2004, it was born out of the return of its founders to their community after experiencing the negative impacts of conventional agriculture and agrochemicals. This return marked the beginning of a path towards reconnecting with indigenous ancestral knowledge and adopting permaculture and organic production. One of the key achievements has been the recovery of soils degraded by monocultures and eucalyptus. Although slow, this process has demonstrated the benefits of a regenerative approach and strengthened the resilience of the community. Allpa Tarpuna is currently focusing on: Allpa Tarpuna integrates bio-construction, renewable energy and sustainable water management into its practices. It also encourages the preservation of ancestral seeds and agro-ecological techniques such as crop rotation, reducing dependence on chemicals. In the future, it wants to expand its training in permaculture design, combining indigenous knowledge with modern regenerative solutions. It seeks to empower more local farmers, promoting designs that restore the connection between people and nature. Allpa Tarpuna is a living indigenous family that sows regeneration, inspiring a sustainable and resilient balance. https://allpatarpuna.org HortaFCUL is a community-based permaculture project based in Lisbon University’s Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). The initiative was launched by a group of biology students concerned about the gap between sustainability ideals and the university’s environmental impact. This bottom-up project has developed an important role as a catalyst of practical scientific-based knowledge. Nowadays, HortaFCUL is a resilient, sustainable and inclusive community, allowing the general public to learn more about nature-based solutions. It has five subprojects at campus level and relies on a volunteer-based horizontally-organised guardians collective to maintain the project’s green areas. HortaFCUL, as a permaculture project, achieves its central goals by closing functional loops related to human activities.

"As politicians wait, grassroots changemakers are restoring ecosystems and rebuilding resilience. They are living examples that regeneration is not just possible, it’s already happening all over the world.  The Lush Spring Prize 2025 is showcasing this work and has awarded around £250,000 to 19 groups, celebrating regenerative organisations and practitioners from around the world. Lead image: Clockwise from top left: Agro-Pueblos (Colombia), Ñu’u Ndito (Mexico), Global Ecovillage Network (Global), Land in Our Names (UK) In a joyous, collaborative and inspiring week of celebrations, the 2025 recipients were honoured as part of a celebratory event held in Dorset (UK), where the Lush Cosmetics company is headquartered. The event was attended by prize recipients, Spring Prize judges, Lush staff, press, funders and other regenerative practitioners. Co-designed with the prize recipients themselves, the event provides a space to connect, co-learn and share stories of regeneration. It offered an opportunity to explore both the diversity of people and organisations that make up the regenerative movement and the common challenges, learnings and successes that unites it. Each Spring Prize year sees different themes emerge that are shaped by the organisations that receive a prize. In 2025, these include the importance of weaving ancestral wisdom with scientific approaches; working at multiple scales and legally recognising the rights of nature, and learning from those on the frontlines that are facilitating regenerative work in conflict zones or regions experiencing natural disasters. In 2025, the backdrop of violence and conflict looms large. Prize recipients from Lebanon and Ukraine are responding to invasions by powerful aggressors, in Myanmar they are working in a context of ongoing internal conflict and many of the Indigenous groups are frequently facing the threat of violence.  The Spring Prize 2025 event allows these groups to come together and share what regenerative work in these situations looks like in a way that may challenge the existing narrative: “In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the biggest achievement for our organisation is to continue our activities and find ways to be useful for Ukrainian society like creating permaculture public spaces and rehabilitating people in our demonstration centers. The war has taught us that strength is in unity and networks, that autonomous homesteads and farms that grow their own food and preserve their seeds can not only survive but also help other people, and that international support and networks matter.” NGO Permaculture in Ukraine While humanity witnesses declining biodiversity, climate catastrophes and widespread conflict, these organisations highlight how regenerative practices are not just a source of hope but a necessary and much needed response.

Examples of this year’s awarded projects include: Aguaje palm tree seedlings were distributed among Kukama families in Parinari, Loreto, Peru, as part of the reforestation and conservation initiative led by Huaynakana. Extractivism represents a constant threat to the Kukama territory in Peru and the loss of the Kukama peoples’ cultural identity. Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana exists to protect this. The Kukama people conceive of the territory as a whole and women having an intrinsic connection to it. The term ‘kukama’ for example is composed of two words: ‘ku’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘kama’ meaning ‘bosom,’ and it signifies ‘field-bosom’ or ‘nourished by the field.’ Given the Kukama peoples’ lives are reliant on the forest ecosystems of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and considering how they have adapted and coexisted with them for decades, the territory and the rivers are inseparable from their culture and way of life. They consider the rivers to be living beings with spirits, and therefore sacred. Founded in 2001, Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana embarked on a long journey of collective actions, protests, and mobilisations in pursuit of environmental justice as the river’s health declined as a result of extractive industries. In September 2021 Huaynakana filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognise the Marañón River as a living being and subject of rights. In March 2024, the provincial court of Nauta ruled that the Marañón River has intrinsic rights, including the right to flow, to be free from pollution, and to be restored to environmental health. This decision also recognised Indigenous communities as the river’s legal representatives, defenders, and guardians. This landmark ruling was ratified by the higher court last November. Huaynakana plays a key role in defending the Marañón’s rights and supporting the regeneration and conservation of the waterways through reforestation efforts because without the river, these unique forests cannot exist. Mushrooms harvested from the Ubuntu food forest Ubuntu Learning Hub Trust was set up in 2022 with a mission to support people who are in transition towards more resilient futures and a healthier planet. The Trust immediately began to set up the Ubuntu Learning Centre as an open learning space for all ages as well as a demonstration centre for integrating technologies that are in tune with a healthy Mother Earth. The learning centre sits on a two-hectare site in Chikancila village in Chongwe district of Lusaka Province of Zambia. It is founded on the African philosophy of Ubuntu which helps people to learn what it means to be truly human. It hosts people from all walks of life who are looking for pathways to escape the rat race and curve more sustainable futures for themselves, their families and the communities where they come from. The Trust uses agro-ecological practices to regenerate the degraded farmland that was damaged over decades of poor land husbandry. For example, the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) technique has helped to restore much of the indigenous vegetation on the land. People come to Ubuntu to explore the meaning of life and to find their life purpose. They stay at Ubuntu for varying lengths of time and in the process they are engaged in intercultural exchanges as well as learning how to take care of themselves and of Mother Earth. The Trust offers life changing experiences rather than certificates and the opportunity to carve out an earth-centred worldview for themselves.

Harvesting with Battmung friends The LUSH Spring Prize is a joint venture between LUSH Cosmetics and Ethical Consumer and is now in its sixth prize cycle, having started in 2017. The Spring Prize has distributed more than £1.3 million to regenerative projects worldwide. The LUSH Spring Prize was set up to support ‘regenerative’ projects – those that go beyond sustainability by taking holistic approaches to building the health of ecology, economy and social systems. It seeks to support those who are leaving the world lusher than they found it, and are actively restoring all the systems they are part of. By supporting regenerative projects the Spring Prize hopes to raise the profile of the movement as a whole to inspire more individuals, groups, communities, funders, media platforms and businesses to start engaging with regenerative processes.  The Spring Prize judging panels are made up of people drawn from a diverse range of movements that represent regenerative design, permaculture, food sovereignty, transition towns, biomimicry, eco-village networks and various social justice movements. Each prize cycle a ‘Lush Customer Judge’ and ‘Lush Staff Judge’ are also selected to act as additional independent members of the judging panel.  The collaborative prizes have separate panels, which also include judges from the main Spring Prize panel. The majority of the judging panel for the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Award self identify as Indigenous themselves, some being previous recipients of the award. The judges are not just involved in choosing the recipients but are involved in shaping the prize as a whole, attending the event and connecting with prize recipients.

"Around 40 years ago, the Sahel, an extremely arid region located in central Africa, was an area of agricultural desolation. Due to natural factors such as heavy drought and interannual variability, combined with anthropocentric influences like climate change, overgrazing and deforestation, the environment has become particularly unstable with little possibility for productivity.  Furthermore, when rain does fall in the arid region, the soil is so dry due to a lack of precipitation, that water immediately ‘runs off’ or evaporates, failing to soak into the depleted earth. Some countries within the region, such as Burkina Faso, faced up to 24% of their arable lands classed as highly degraded in 1998 (Maatman et al., 1998).  In the early 2000s, NGOs and organisations such as the United Nations, the World Food Programme and WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), amongst others, sought to reverse the desertification of many parts of Africa, including the Sahel, in cooperation with farmers and communities from the affected regions. Using the ancient ‘half moon’ water harvesting technique – used for centuries in Africa and the Middle East, the revitalised technique aims to facilitate water retention and re-green the ecosystem. Heavy machinery or hand tools can be used to plough the soil roughly 30cm down in a semi-circle or ‘half moon’ shape. The diameter of these half moons are typically about 4 metres. When it rains, the contours catch the rainwater, preventing runoff and allowing it to infiltrate the soil. This creates ‘favourable micro-climate conditions’ allowing drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet to be planted.  If planted on steep slopes, half-moon ‘bunds’ can assist the growth of tree species. They can also be used in combination with controlled grazing to boost re-vegetation. In Niger, The World Food Programme (WFP) has been implementing half-moon planting projects since 2014. Just 5 years into the scheme, the benefits of its implementation were examined by a progress-review. In 2019, over 400 households had restored approximately 3,000 acres of land, largely for use in producing food for livestock. This has promoted social cohesion and economic growth by providing more jobs and stabilising agricultural output in a formerly capricious climate. This scenario exhibits the benefits of a localised, small-scale regenerative farming technique such as half-moon planting through its trickle-down effects, stipulating broader socio-economic growth. A study on the impact of reformed agroecological techniques was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Burkina Faso. Figures revealed that fields ploughed using the half-moon method saw the rates of increase for grain yield at 8% (The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 2017). As farmers sought new ways to boost crop yields, regenerative farming techniques such as the half-moon method were found to be successful when used in conjunction with others. In Burkina Faso, half-moon planting is exercised alongside the Zaï technique, which is useful when adapting to various soil types and structures. The Zaï method, suitable to the arid Sahel region, uses similar methods seen in the half-moons, but alternatively involves digging smaller pits in non-permeable soil to intercept water and gather compost material. These pits are slightly smaller than the half-moons and so are less labour intensive and can be utilised in smaller growing plots. They are roughly between 15-50cm across; 5-15cm deep; and positioned 80cm apart. This technique was reintroduced to the area in the 1980s by farmer and agronomist Yacouba Sawadogo, who pioneered the method of filling the holes with manure to further break up the earth and bolster soil productivity.

"Traditional Māori time systems were measured in accordance to the night as opposed to the Western proxy of daylight. Each night of the lunar month had a particular name and this cumulatively formed a lunar calendar known as ‘Maramataka‘. Farming according to the Maramataka lunar calendar is used in conjunction with Māori regenerative farming techniques to adapt to nature’s schedule as opposed to imposing controls on the earth’s processes. Many farmers are now seeking to turn back to these ancient methods in line with broader sustainability imperatives. Under the Maramataka calendar, individual lunar nights were marked according to how optimal they were for catching fish, eels or planting crops, with each night having its own name. A good example is eel fishing. It is not productive on a full moon – Rākaunui – because the moon’s light would not allow eel to hunt their prey, as the prey could see them. As with biodynamics (the Rudolf Steiner lunar approach for farming), planting crops is nest at a full moon, when the gravitational pull is at its highest, because it has maximum influence on water in the soil. “Despite the use of Maramataka being limited to a relative few today, largely because of colonisation, interest in and revival of this knowledge and practice is growing.”1 Many farmers are returning to the use of farming tactics such as Maramataka planting in line with broader regenerative goals. The Revitalise Te Taiao programme aims to fund sustainable and lucrative agribusiness solutions to cultivate Te Taiao (the natural world). This project provided $2.7 million in funding to Miru Young and Mohi Beckham, farmers based in the North Island’s Bay of Plenty, to trial agriculture techniques which aim to “enhance the mana and mauri of the soil” across 10 farm sites. As part of the scheme, both farmers undertook rigorous research, sowing pasture throughout different moon phases from resting and dormant phases to high-energy phases for plant growth. Soon, grass seeds sown during the high energy periods of the Maramataka calendar outgrew neighbouring crops planted in other phases, even if the latter had been sown 10 days before. Despite still being in the trial stages of Maramataka planting, Miru and Mohi observed various positive impacts of the scheme within the first few months. Their land has seen higher productivity and crop yields, with a 93% crop survival rate under Maramataka planting, that is an increase of 13% from the usual 80% under previous methods. One of the main issues associated with returning to traditional farming methods on a broader scale is competing with intensive methods in New Zealand’s modern agricultural industry. After settlers from the West arrived in New Zealand during the 18th and 19th centuries, intensive farming practices quickly became widespread.  As farming in the country has continuously expanded into the modern day, with agricultural exports making up a large proportion of the country’s GDP, traditional farming methods have become far less lucrative in the broader market. This meant that Māori farmers had to adopt newer techniques, as those trying to maintain the traditional methods were faced with far lower crop yields and income. Rural management programmes and sustainability objectives are constantly investigating new and feasible ways to rejuvenate te ao Māori farming techniques, with the Revitalise Te Taiao programme representing just one of many schemes. The Maramataka lunar calendar is part of a broader Maori worldview known as Mātauranga Māori – a term used to describe the collective knowledge of Māori living in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the knowledge passed down from their ancestors. Kaitiakitanga (stewardship/management) and the link between Whakapapa (Māori genealogy/ancestral descent) and Whenua (land) are key areas of te ao Māori and Mātauranga values.  By embracing schools of thought that are native to Aotearoa, alongside promoting equitable stewardship across modern farming methodologies, high agricultural output can be attained. Reforming the agribusiness in New Zealand will involve reintegrating Māori into decision making processes, embracing cross-cultural thought processes and utilising western technological advancements for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.

"Lammas is a celebration of the summer and the gathering in of the grain harvest. This was especially significant in the past. After all the hard work of getting the grain crop cut, threshed, stored and stacked, there came a time for feasting, celebration and assessment. Lammas is a Saxon name meaning ‘Loaf-mass’. Lughnasadh (pronounced Loo-nas-ah) is Irish Gaelic. On Lammas Eve fires were lit on Lammas mounds such as Silbury Hill at Avebury, to honour the Corn Mother as she gives birth to her harvest child, the Grain. This is the seed that will bring next year’s harvest as well as the grain that will sustain life throughout the winter. The month of August was the month of the Grain Mother. An ‘augur’ is an old word for seer and meant ‘increaser’. The great abundance of the Earth Mother is reflected in the titles she was given at this time: The Grain Mother, Barley Mother, Corn Mother, Demeter, Ceres, Cerealia, Grain, the Wise One of the Earth, the Increaser, She who is the seed, who is the womb, who is the soil, the Great Provider, the Preserver of Life. Cutting the ‘corn’ seems to be a general term for all cereal crops, whether they are wheat, barley, rye or oats. There were many customs and rituals throughout Europe to honour the first and the last sheaf of corn to be cut. The last sheaf was often cut by the youngest girl present and fashioned into a Corn Maiden. It was carried joyfully back to the village, sometimes plaited and decked with ribbons, and usually hung over the fireplace. Sometimes it was dressed in women’s clothes, and ritually burnt on the Lammas Fire. Sometimes these Corn Maidens were kept until Yule when they were divided up amongst the cattle or kept until the spring. Sometimes they were kept with the date tied to them. Many Corn Maidens would be seen hanging above the fireplace. In Scotland the ‘young maid’ was made out of the last stalks cut, and kept. The ‘old wife’ was made out of the first stalks cut and was passed on to the nearest farm that had not finished bringing in the corn. This was then passed round until it ended up at the last farm to be cut. Another old European custom was to weave the last sheaf into a large Corn Mother with a smaller corn doll inside it, representing next year’s unborn harvest. The regenerative power of the Earth is never more manifest than now as the grain harvest is gathered in and the Sun’s cycle begins to wane. The Cauldron of Regeneration was central to Celtic spiritual understanding. We are renewed by sleep and darkness, through many deaths and rebirths, and by the sacrifice of our outer lives for the inner journey. Here at Lammas, the doorway to the inner realms is opening. This is the symbolism behind the Demeter/Kore/Persephone story. Demeter, the Corn Mother, represents the ripe corn of this year’s harvest, and Kore or Persephone represents the grain-seed who lives in the dark throughout the winter and reappears in the Spring. Persephone’s descent into the Underworld is a mythical interpretation of the seed lying in the ground during the dark winter months, and her reappearance as the young maid, or the new sprouting seed, in the spring. This story shows us the Triple Goddess in all her aspects: as Earth Mother, the abundant provider; as the Crone, the wisdom found within; and as the Maiden who returns renewed in the spring. Pluto/Hades’ abduction of Persephone is a later reworking of this older myth. After all the manifest energy and activity of the early summer, it is good to make time now to rest and to assimilate all that has happened during the Sun’s active phase. Lammas celebrations would probably have begun with the cutting of the last sheaf of corn. Although the 2nd of August is the calendar date for Lammas, the great Lammas fairs and feasts would probably have lasted from mid July to mid August and would have peaked around the time of the harvest Full Moon. Once the grain had been safely gathered in and the men returned from their hunting trips, it was a time for feasting, dancing and merry-making, a great celebration of the first of the harvest and assessment of the year’s achievements. Beer, wine, cider and whisky made from the previous year’s harvest, were ritually drunk, celebrating the transformative power of Fire and Water. Cooking fires were honoured as they too embodied the power of Fire and Water. Bread was made from the new grain and thanks were given to the Sun’s life energy reborn as the bread of life. This is a busy time for harvesting herbs and collecting herb seeds to sow in the spring. Give thanks and blessings as you pick them, dry them and store them. Review what you know about them and ways you can use them both physically and metaphysically. Harvest sage at the end of July, before the flowers have come out. Sage is a herb associated with wisdom and releasing blocks in expression. It is connected to the throat chakra and is for those who have something to say but cannot let it out. It will help you express your emotions. Make the herb tea in the usual way. The infusion is a useful antiseptic herb for sore throats, laryngitis, tonsillitis, mouth ulcers and mouth infections. It can be used as a gargle, for bathing wounds, sores, and to stop bleeding. Use the tea infusion externally and then drink afterwards as well. It will dry up excess secretions such as catarrh or sinusitis. It contains oestrogen and is useful in the menopause and for delayed menstruation. Burn dried sage to cleanse and purify. Waft the smoke around a person to cleanse their aura (called smudging). This is a good way to begin any ritual or ceremony. N.B. It must not be taken if pregnant, and because of its drying action, it must not be taken for long periods of time. It will dry up mother’s milk. Care must be taken by those who are insulin-dependent, and to be avoided by epileptics. Garlands of meadowsweet were traditionally worn for the Lammas celebrations. Its heady perfume expands the psyche, and builds inner strength. It enhances flexibility and connection to the inner levels. It is a mild sedative and painkiller containing salicylic acid (aspirin) that affects the rate at which blood clots. It is a good digestive tonic that reduces excess acidity and is useful for heartburn, hyperacidity, gastritis and peptic ulcers. As it cleanses the body of harmful acids, it is useful for any inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is a strong diuretic (increases urine) and can be used for any bladder or kidney complaint including cystitis. It reduces stagnation in the liver and therefore will help the immune system function more effectively. Its harvest time is July and August when the flowers are just beginning to open. Collect them in brown paper bags to dry for later use. N.B. Avoid if on anti-coagulant drugs. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Sacred Earth Celebrations, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"There are various methods for drying herbs for herbal recipes but they all require that the herb is dried and stored out of the light. I prefer to use brown paper bags, other people hang them up in bunches or lay them between sheets of newspaper or brown paper. • If using brown paper bags always label the bags with the name of the herb, the date and where you picked it. This is good practice and a good habit to get into as plants can change a lot in the drying process. Even if you think you will know what it is, it is surprising how you can forget, especially if you bag up several herbs over a period of a few weeks. • Leave the bags in a dry warm environment for several weeks. Put them in the airing cupboard if you have one, hang over the wood-burner or leave them on top of radiators. Shake the bags and turn the leaves over with your hands every day or two. It is essential to do this to stop any mould getting in to the herbs while they are still drying. • The herbal properties of leaves and flowers will deteriorate after 1 year so they need to be re-collected every year. Fruit, seeds, berries, roots and bark will last for 2 years. It is light that destroys the herbal properties of herbs, so at its simplest herbs can be stored all year in brown paper bags, although if they are kept in the kitchen they will need to be kept in a plastic container or airtight tin to keep them dry. Keeping the herbs in a dedicated leather or cotton bag is the traditional medicine way and these are hung somewhere warm and dry, near a radiator or fire. Putting them into dark glass jars is good in a kitchen because of the condensation. Clear jam jars are fine if they are kept in a dark cupboard. At its simplest the jar can be kept in a brown paper bag or more creative ways can be found. Herb teas vary in taste and quality. Buying popular blends as tea bags is convenient, but be aware that the herbs may be old by the time you drink them, and the herbs may have been grown in monocultures and sprayed with petrochemicals. It is infinitely better to make your own. • Making herb teas is not an exact science, especially when using the common safe plants. Interestingly, different herbalists use different amounts. I use about a teaspoonful of dried herbs or a small pile that fits into the hollow of my palm, and between a half to a pint of water, depending on the need. Use less for young children and anyone who is weak and frail. Dried herbs have twice the strength of fresh herbs, so twice the amount of fresh herb is used. • As you make the tea, say thank you to the plant. This open-hearted attitude adds to the healing process. I like to picture the plant and affirm its healing qualities as I wait for the tea to brew, partly to affirm the healing I am engaged in and also as a memory aid. This way I keep learning and understanding more about the plants all the time and keep my knowledge strong. Many of the herbs are an acquired taste. Nurture an openness to these wild flavours and earthy tastes and give them a chance. More often than not, a taste you didn’t like at first becomes a taste that you find you love. These are also for adults only as they are a mixture of brandy and honey. This makes them a most delicious way to take your medicine! They are especially good to use when travelling as they are kept in small dropper bottles and taken neat. Elixirs are combination remedies, created for specific uses and personal needs. Elixirs need to taste good so the addition of any aromatic herbs improves the flavour, but must also support the over-all herbal action. They are experimental and fun, as well as being extremely effective and I like to give them creative names. Write up everything in your Herb Journal. This is especially important when you make combination elixirs. Recording the plants and proportions used is invaluable when you create something you want to repeat. Method one 1. Half fill a dark jar with a herb or combinations of herbs: tear the leaves, crush the seeds or fruit, and chop the roots. Send your thanks to the plants. Add a little of something that will give it a nice flavour such as rose petals, sweet violet, lavender, rosemary, lemon verbena etc, making sure that their actions support the overall use of the remedy. 2. Cover the plant matter with clear runny honey and send your silent thanks to the bees. Poke well with a chopstick to get out any trapped air bubbles and break the plant matter up further. 3. Then top the jar up with brandy and 4. Put on the lid and label, date and shake well. Give it a poke and a shake frequently and keep out of bright light. They are ready in about a month, although they come to no harm if they are left longer. 5. Strain off the plant matter and rebottle in clean dark dropper bottles. Pour a little boiling water over the mash of herbs that are left over, getting every last bit of goodness out of them. Toast the plant and its medicine and have your first taste before returning the spent mash to the earth with thanks. Method two Create an instant elixir using the tinctures you have made. 1. Using a jug combine several tinctures that support the remedy you are making. 2. Mix in a similar amount of honey to tincture and mix the two together. 3. Pour into dark dropper bottles. Name and date and write up in your herb journal. Their dosage is similar to tinctures, although I tend to use them little and often. Here are some suggestions of plants to choose from, depending on what you have available. I have listed the native plants first and the aromatics at the end. Anti-stress elixir Hawthorn, cowslip, vervain, rose petals, lavender, borage. Drops of calm Hawthorn, elderflowers, cowslip, hops, valerian, vervain, rose petals, borage, lavender, chamomile. — This is an extract from Glennie Kindred’s Letting in the Wild Edges, which inspires us to celebrate the bounties of our wild native plants and find a richer relationship with the natural world around us.

"Growing my own mulch has long been a goal of mine. We use a lot of mulch in the nursery and garden and at the moment I have no problem sourcing straw but if/when the day comes that the farmers start using their own straw to improve their soil (which is becoming a more common practice), I’ll be needing to step up my mulch growing efforts. Currently, I grow enough mulch to sustain my perennial beds and around 10% of my annual beds but rely on imported straw for mulching the other 90% of annual vegetable and nursery beds. My ideal mulch plant grows fast, is drought tolerant, competes minimally with crop plants, does not contain seed that easily spreads, is easy to handle and cut, i.e. not thorny/prickly or tough and fibrous, and can biodegrade relatively quickly (thereby returning the nutrients back to soil). I’ve broadly categorized the main sources of mulch we produce in our 1500m2 garden. Aquatic plants
I grow emergent wetland species such us cattails (Typha spp), sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.) on the banks of a small pond (6m x 3m), and within a grey water reed bed (1m x 6m). The pond also provides suitable habitat for hornworts (Ceratophyllum spp). a submerged rootless perennial that gathers on the surface en masse. This plant makes an excellent mulch being rich in nitrogen, growing very fast and is easy to position around the base of plants. The emergent species provide a good thick carbon rich mulch that helps to reduce evaporation on the terrestrial beds and I cut these back in the spring in case they are used for overwintering invertebrates. Aquatic plants are an excellent source of mulch as there are no issues with seed germinating amongst your land based crops. Tap rooted perennial / biennials
Deep rooted perennial plants tend to produce a good amount of biomass, are generally drought tolerant and do not compete strongly with our crop plants. I have found native biennial weeds such as greater burdock (Arctium lappa), a very useful mulch plant with the gigantic leaves growing back very fast after a cut. Lesser burdock (Arctium minus), is also useful albeit to lesser extent. Although biennial, if you cut back these plants before flowering you can prolong their life, harvesting good quantities of seed free biomass. I do eventually allow some of the plants to flower and they are much loved by bees among other insects. Comfrey (Symphytum x uplandicum), ‘bocking 14’, is a classic example of a deep rooted mulch plant. We have the plant scattered throughout the garden and planted in dedicated patches. The plants do require irrigation however and will only provide good leaf yields if grown on fertile soil. Peeing on the plants is recommended. Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), provide a great source of biomass. For a good tuber harvest it’s best to wait until the end of the season before harvesting the mulch. We can never consume as much as we produce of these tubers in the kitchen. I have found them to be much appreciated by our pigs and an excellent source of fresh winter food for our rabbits. Leaves of greater burdock (Arctium lappa) Nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs 
These plants take a while to establish but make an excellent contribution. I’ve had good results from coppicing empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), when they are 3-years-old and chop and dropping the soft new growth three or four times a year. I am expecting to also see good results from grey alder (Alnus incana) and Italian alder (Alnus cordata). I avoid using thorny nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs for this purpose. Annual trimming of shrubs such as autumn olive – Elaeagnus umbellata and broom – Cytisus scoparius also provides good quantities of mulch. Click here for more info on nitrogen fixing plants. Lawn and ground cover
One of my favourite sources of mulch is lawn trimmings. They are great for mulching potted plants or applying a mulch into tight spots. Mixed species lawns will contain a more diverse mix of mineral nutrients. Lawns including a legume such as white clover (Trifolim repens), can provide a nitrogen rich mulch. It’s a good idea to leave some of the trimmings behind to keep the lawn healthy. Autumn leaf fall and herbaceous stem residue
The annual shedding of leaves from trees and shrubs in our garden make a great contribution to our mulch capital. Leaves can be cleared from paths, lawns and wildflower beds (as they will disrupt the growth in these areas) and concentrated where they are of benefit such as the base of high demanding fruiting shrubs such as blackcurrants or blackberries. Herbaceous perennials such as lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis) and mints (Mentha spp). will provide dead stems annually. It’s always a good idea to leave hollow stems of some herbaceous perennials to remain for the winter as they are utilized by invertebrates for egg laying and hibernating. If the plant does not have a hollow stem it can be cut back and used for mulch. Fennel (Foeniculm vulgare), provides large quantities of biomass and as far as I can tell the stems are not utilised by any organism over the winter. In the vegetable garden all the remnants of my crops after harvesting go straight back to the surface for recycling. Foeniculum vulgare and other herbaceous perennials Tree prunings
Woody prunings from shrubs, trees and vines cut into small pieces (5-10cm) make good mulch in the mature areas of the forest garden with well established fungal soils specializing in breaking down the lignified woody material. Living mulches 
In the more mature areas of the garden where the trees have established (5yrs and older) I have dispensed with mulch all together in favour of ground cover plants that can be considered living mulches. Some the most successful perennial living mulches I have found that form good dense cover in the shade include bugle (Ajuga reptans), spotted dead nettle (Lamium maculatum), Caucasian stonecrop (Sedem spurium), perwinkle (Vinca major) and betony (Stachys officinalis). Lamium maculatum spreading well under a mullbery (Morus alba) Scaling up mulch production
In order to grow enough mulch to provide a water retaining, weed excluding barrier for my annual and nursery beds I would certainly need more space. A larger wetland area would be ideal, with aquatic species growing very fast and the seed bearing parts of the plants being non problematic to use on terrestrial beds. If you don’t have a reliable aquatic habitat, the next best option for growing quantities of mulch without irrigation and fertilization is probably grass. During my next post I’ll be sharing a plan where using the lessons garnered from small scale systems, we’ll be growing mulch to support approx 670 fruit trees and 1360 soft fruit shrubs on a 5ha Agroforestry Project (design layout below).

"There are many medicinal uses for elder – Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae family). It is an evocative tree, steeped in history, tradition, and folklore. This is one of our great food and medicinal plants, easily found in most areas of the British Isles where people have settled. It’s botanical name, Sambucus nigra, stems from the Greek word sambuke; a ‘musical pipe’, due to its hollow form supplying our ancestors a perfect wood for making pipes. The Latin ‘nigra’, means black, in allusion to the dark colour of ripe elder berry fruit. Elder is a deciduous woodland and hedgerow plant, native to Northern Europe and North America, and can be seen happily growing on most types of soil up to altitudes of approximately 470m. Superstition says to not cut elder down or burn them. This may be purely because of the toxic fumes which rise from burning elder wood, or it may be that the faeries will be really upset because you are destroying such a useful plant! Other legends have grown around this plant, such as that of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who allegedly betrayed Jesus to the Romans, then said to have hanged himself from its branches. This story gave rise to the name of the edible fungus found all year round on the elder – the Jelly Ear. Elder can sometimes be found growing as a shrubby form, and sometimes like a tree on a single trunk, similar to other woodland-edge plants like hazel, hawthorn and blackthorn. A mature elder typically displays a domed crown, and will be spotted from a distance once you know it. Elders can reach 8m or more, although more commonly 5-6m or so, because of other limiting environmental factors. Ideally the plant likes a rich and damp soil in a sunny position. Elder does not like exposed sites or windy hillsides. The branches display numerous lenticels (air holes) and produce their stems with opposite pairs of buds. The buds are naked, without bud scales. The light brown, corky bark pattern on elder can appear quite similar to the invasive exotic, the ‘butterfly bush’ – Buddleja davidii. The similarity between Sambucus and Buddleja ends there. Elder’s leaves are completely different in form. They are compound, comprising of seven oval, serrated leaflets, each being about 7-10cm long. The leaflets typically come in two or three opposite pairs with one terminal leaflet. They are a much lighter green colour than the Himalayan native ‘butterfly bush’ which has a simple, lanceolate / elliptical leaf. You will find this year’s flowers and fruits on last year’s growth. The umbel-like elderflowers, (technically corymbs), are borne on terminal stems. Five creamy-white petals surround the yellow anthers. When ripe, and picked on a sunny day, are bursting with pollen and scent, and should be a bright lemon-yellow. They turn brown when past their best. Only pick ripe flowers! The flowers have a small amount of natural yeast on them which assists fermentation when making drinks. This will be testified by anyone who makes the superb thirst quenching elderflower champagne! The rank smell of elder leaves or the gone-over flowers is known to repel many who come across it, often being described as a cat urine smell!  After a short but sweet period in full bloom, the flowers give rise to upstanding clusters of small berries, which are typically no bigger than 10mm in diameter. Initially green, the berries gradually begin to nod earthwards as they ripen. At the end of the summer they are dark purple – with many medicinal uses. Parts used Flowers, berries, leaves, bark, fungi. Harvest time The flowers are picked when in full bloom. The berries are picked when ripe in the autumn. Key active medicinal constituents Tannins, potassium, mucilage, phenols, triterpenes, sterols, lectins, flavonoids (including rutin). The dark coloured berries are rich in anthocyanins, folic acid and vitamins A and C. They also contain flavonoids, and cyanidin glucosides, which are poisonous in large doses.  Medicinal actions Diaphoretic, febrifuge, anti-catarrhal, anti viral, immuno-supportive. Uses – Elderflowers and berries are expectorant and diaphoretic, thus they help to manage and reduce fevers and to rid the body of toxins. – Elderflowers are also anti-viral and are useful in combating herpes simplex type 1 virus (responsible for cold sores). – The flowers can be made into champagne, cordials, wine, sorbet, jam and fritters. – Elderberry extract has been proven to inhibit various strains of flu, especially if taken early enough. Many people can testify that elder can significantly reduce recovery times from influenza. – Some books have stated the ripe berries are poisonous, but this is slightly misleading. They will cause gastric upset if you eat a large quantity raw, (as will too many apples while scrumping) but in small amounts they should present no problem. Cooked into jams, syrups etc., larger quantities of elderberries are absolutely fine. – Pioneering contemporary forager-chefs have rediscovered that even the green berries can be used, as ‘capers’, if prepared correctly. This involves fermenting the berries in a salt brine solution for a few days, similar to preparing green walnuts for pickling, and then covering in a flavoured vinegar. – Even when the tree is dormant in the winter, it is still possible to harvest food! The ‘Jelly ear’ fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is often found on elder, dead or alive. Known as a delicacy in China, it is best cooked sliced into thin strips, in a spicy, oriental-style soup.

"There’s a plethora of info out there about comfrey but not much detail regarding establishing and managing a comfrey patch so I thought I would write an article to share my experience on this and how we grow comfrey as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden. A member of the borage family, comfrey – Symphytum spp. is native to Europe and Asia and there are 40 recorded species throughout that region. The plant most commonly referred to and used in gardens is Russian comfrey – Symphytum x uplandicum, a naturally occurring hybrid of two wild species: common comfrey – Symphytum officinale and prickly comfrey – Symphytum asperum. A few centuries back, the hybrid Symphytum x uplandicum came to the attention of Henry Doubleday (1810-1902) and he widely promoted the plant as a food and forage crop. Years later, and after two world wars, Lawrence D Hills (1911-1991) would continue Henry Doubleday’s Comfrey crusade. In the 1950s, Hills developed a comfrey research program in the village of Bocking, near Braintree in the UK. The original trial site is on the plot of land now occupied by the Doubleday Gardens housing development. Lawrence Hills lived at 20 Convent Lane just around the corner of the trial site. At this site, Hills trialed at least 21 comfrey ‘strains’, each one named after the village Bocking. Strain 14 was identified as being the most nutrient rich, non-seeding strain and ‘Bocking 14’ began its journey into gardens far and wide across the world. (Learn more its history on the Balkan Ecology Project blog.) Medicinal – Comfrey has been cultivated as a healing herb since at least 400BC. The Greeks and Romans commonly used comfrey to stop heavy bleeding, treat bronchial problems and heal wounds and broken bones. Poultices were made for external wounds and tea was consumed for internal ailments. Comfrey has been reported to promote healthy skin with its mucilage content that moisturizes and soothes and promotes cell proliferation. This plant is my first port of call if ever I need to dress a wound. Simply take a few leaves brush them together to remove the hairs and wrap them around the wound and apply light pressure. It’s incredibly effective at stopping the bleeding, reducing the pain and healing the wound. Biomas – Comfrey produces large amounts of foliage from late May (late spring) until hard frosts in October or November (late autumn). The plant is excellent for producing mulch and can be cut from 2-5 times per year depending on how well the plants are watered and fed. The plant grows rapidly after each harvest. In our gardens we have Comfrey ‘Bocking 14’ located next to each fruit tree in order to have a renewable source of mulch just where we need it. We also grow in patches as part of our fertility strategy in the market garden and have patches in the wildflower meadows (details below). We’ve supplied 1,000 ‘Bocking 14’ cuttings to Oxygenisis, a business in Germany who are experimenting with using this plant for carbon capture. Mineral dam – Comfrey has deep roots of up to 2m that utilize nutrients deep in the subsoil that would otherwise wash away with the underground soil water or remain inaccessible to other plants. The nutrients, once taken up from the roots, are relocated throughout the plant as and where needed with some of them ending up in the comfrey leaf mass. When cutting the leaf mass and applying to the soil surface, the mined nutrients are returned and again made accessible to shallower rooted crop plants.  Biodiversity – The bell shaped flowers provide nectar and pollen to many species of bees and other insects from late May until the first frosts in late autumn. Lacewings are said to lay eggs on comfrey and spiders overwinter on the plant. Parasitoid wasps and spiders will hunt on and around comfrey. Pest and disease prevention and control – Research indicates that a comfrey solution can be used to prevent powdery mildew. Pest predators such as spiders, lacewings and parasatoid wasps associate with this plant. It’s best to leave some plants alone in order to sustain pest predator relationships. Ground cover – Some species can quickly spread to form a thick ground cover and work particularly well for ground cover on the sunny side under shrubs and trees. Symphytum tuberosum – Tuberous Comfrey seems to be the best species for this.  Fertilizer – Comfrey leaves contain a great balance of major plant nutrients (N,P,K) and can be fed to plants as powder, direct mulch or by steeping chopped comfrey leaves in water for several weeks to produce a thick, dark liquid that can be diluted with water and applied to plant roots. More on this below. Nutritional value of comfrey – You can see from the below table that wilted comfrey contains significantly higher quantities of potash compared to other organic fertilizers. It’s well recorded that comfrey is an excellent source of potassium (K) a major plant nutrient that is required by plants in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction. Animal fodder – Comfrey has a long history for use as an animal feed. Lawrence D Hills dedicated books to this topic.* The leaves are best received by animals wilted. Fresh leaves can be eaten by pigs, sheep, and poultry but cattle, rabbits and horses will only consume wilted leaves. Human consumption – Symphytum officianale and Symphytum x uplandicum are both reported to be used for salad and potherb and are best when cooked. Personally I’m not keen on the texture but will have the occasional nibble from the garden using the new growth to mix in a spring green salad. Caution – Although comfrey has been used as a food crop, in the past 20 years scientific studies reported that comfrey may be carcinogenic, since it appeared to cause liver damage and cancerous tumors in rats. These reports have temporarily restricted development of comfrey as a food crop. In light of this, the regular consumption of comfrey is not advisable.  Life cycle – Herbaceous perennial Growth habit – Comfrey begins growth in early-April and by early May compact clusters of young leaves are visible in the crown of the old plant. Within a few weeks, the leaf blades with long petioles have grown to over 35cm high. Basal leaves are large, lance-shaped, stalked, and coarsely hairy. The leaves die back following the first frost and remain dormant for winter. Many species can spread vigorously via seed and are generally not welcome in the garden because of this. Other species can spread via tubers and all species quickly regenerate from broken root pieces.  Flowering – Starts in late May or early June and continues until the first frost in late autumn. The bell-shaped flowers with pedicels are in terminal cymes or one-sided clusters. Flowers of common comfrey are usually creamy yellow, but white, red, or purple types have been found in Europe. Prickly comfrey has pink and blue flowers while Russian comfrey has blue, purple, or red-purple flowers. Tuberous comfrey has creamy white flowers. Vegetative growth does not cease with the start of flowering, and the plant will add new stems continuously during the growing season. Most comfrey plants can be somewhat invasive, spreading via seed to parts of the garden where they are not wanted. ‘Bocking 14’ will flower and provide nectar and pollen but will not produce viable seed. Roots – Some species have short, thick, tuberous roots such as Symphytum tuberosum. Others such as Symphytum x uplandicum have deep and expansive root systems. Light – Needs full sun for good biomass production but grows fine in the shade. Shade – Tolerates light shade (about 50%). Moisture – Some species are drought tolerant e.g. Symphytum tuberosum. Cultivated plants require irrigation. USDA Hardiness Zone – 4-9 comfrey crowns and roots are very winter hardy.  Soil – Comfrey is adaptable to many soils, but prefers moist, fertile soils.  pH – Tolerates a wide range (6.5-8.5), although not very sensitive to soil pH, highest yields are reported to occur on soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. Perhaps you’re interested in growing comfrey to feed your animals, for medicine, for mulch, for compost or you’re slightly masochistic and want to roll around naked in the pricky beds of biomass (not me). In any case, here’s how to do it. The plant we use in our gardens is Symphytum x uplandicum – ‘Bocking 14’. A sterile cultivar that produces copious quantities of nutrient dense biomass. The following information is based on using this plant.  Choosing the site – We’re growing for biomass and want the plants to receive as much light as possible. Accordingly, we lay out our beds on an east to west axis (we’re in the northern hemisphere).  Irrigation is necessary if you want to get good yields from the plants so picking a place with access to irrigation is of paramount important.  In areas of low rainfall, using the gradient of the land to channel precipitation towards your beds will reduce the water needs of your plants. In areas of high rainfall with a high water table you should consider diverting water away from the beds. Once established, comfrey is difficult to get rid of, so choose a site where you want it to stay. Don’t plant comfrey in any area you cultivate, as the broken root pieces quickly establish into new plants and can out compete slower growing crops.  Position comfrey downhill from where you expect leachate to be present, i.e downhill from a manure pile , compost heap, outside toilet, animal pen etc., can provide passive fertility to the plants and rescue otherwise lost minerals from draining away with the sub soil ground water. 
Grow the comfrey where you want to use it. As you’ll see later we may be harvesting over 1/4 ton biomass from our patch and don’t want to be carrying that over long distances. Preparing the site – Raised beds are a major part of our fertility strategy and overtime retain water and nutrients very efficiently. I use 1.3m wide beds surrounded by 50cm paths for our crops as this allows easy access for harvesting everywhere in the beds without ever having to tread on the soil and the paths are wise enough to take our lawnmower. To form a bed, the area should be cleared of all plants, which is best achieved by sheet mulching the season before. Pernicious perennials or tap rooted biennials should be dug out. After you have cleared the whole area, mark out the bed shape with string and dig out 50cm wide paths around your beds, applying the soil to the surface of the planting area and thereby creating the initial rise of the bed. Fork over the beds well. If a hardpan is present take the time and effort to eliminate it before planting. Depending on the quality of your soil you may want to add extra compost before planting into the bed. If you have sheet mulched the area before hand, with the additional soil from the paths all you need to do is add a good 20cm thick straw mulch (or some other mulch) and it’s ready for planting. A good mulch to start with will help keep the weeds down while your comfrey gets going. You can alter the depth and gradient of the paths to facilitate the required direction of water movement. Planting material – You can plant out with crown divisions or root cuttings best done in the spring when the soil has warmed. A crown division can be obtained from simply putting a spade through the center of a mature comfrey plant and transplanting the divided sections. For our beds, I divided two year old plants into quarters, sometimes sixths, and these established very well in the first year. It’s bests not to harvest the leaf biomass in the first year in order to allow a deep root system to develop. However if you use large divisions you can start harvesting in July. Root cuttings are a great way to plant out large areas of comfrey. The cuttings should be grown on in small pots with 50% compost 50% river sand mix kept moist and planted out in the spring as soon as the first leaves emerge and the soil has warmed. If you are planting large numbers of root cuttings you can plant directly into the beds by creating ‘nests’ in the straw, adding two cupped handfuls of the above mentioned potting mix and plant the cuttings into this. Keep them moist like a wrung out sponge and the success rate will be very close to 100%. Spacing – The plants should be spaced 60cm apart in rows and 60cm apart at diagonals between rows. Plant the rows 15cm from the edge of the beds. Cutting – In the first year allow the plants to establish so that the roots develop well and penetrate deep into the subsoil. Remove any weeds around the plants leaving them on the surface. The following year the cutting can begin. You can scythe the beds for a quick harvest or cut each plant individually with a pair of secateurs or shears cutting to 5cm or so from ground level. The leaves are prickly so if you have sensitive hands wear gloves. Cut the comfrey as the flowering stalks emerge up to four times a year. Allow the plants to flower at least once during the season to provide bee fodder to a range of native bees and honey bees. Leave the last flush of leaves before the winter so that invertebrates can find winter shelter in the undergrowth. You may need to weed between cuts every now and then but generally the comfrey will quickly cover the surface. Feeding – After you have cut the comfrey, mow the pathways between the beds and empty the trimmings to the base of the comfrey plants. Any trimmings from lawns and hedges in the surrounding area can also be used. We are experimenting with growing nitrogen fixing hedging and ground cover plants adjacent to the patch in order to feed our comfrey. A most excellent comfrey feed is undiluted urine applied at a rate of approx 500 ml per plant twice per growing season. Irrigation – Comfrey will produce more biomass if irrigated and in dry climates it’s essential to irrigate. Comfrey plants wilt very fast in hot conditions and will stop photosynthesising at this point. Twenty litres per m2 per week of drought should be more than adequate. The beauty of biological systems are that, if managed properly, each year the soils improve and the ability of the soil to store water will improve over time. We use passive irrigation diverting water from a mountain stream into the paths around the beds. The paths fill with water, we raise the level by blocking the low points with sacks of sawdust and the water is drawn throughout the soil via capillary action. Passive irrigation in our market garden. The paths fill with water and the water permeates throughout the soil via capillary action. As mulch – Freshly cut comfrey leaves make good mulch because they have high nitrogen content, and don’t pull nitrogen from the soil while decomposing. Comfrey’s high potassium content makes it especially beneficial for vegetables such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers, berries, and fruit trees. With adequate feed and watering we’ve seen yields of 2-3kg of biomass per plant per cut. Comfrey beds establishing well. This bed was planted with divided crowns 5 months prior to this photo being taken. Liquid fertliser – What I like to call ‘Comfert’. Fill a barrel, preferably with a bottom tap and a gauze on the inside (to prevent clogging) about 3/4 full with freshly cut comfrey and add water to fill the barrel. Cover it, and let it steep for 3-6 weeks. The smell from the resulting liquid is far from attractive so approach with caution. The tea may be used full strength or diluted by half or more. Don’t apply before heavy rain is forecast as most of the nutrients suspended in the liquid will wash straight through the soil. For the best results apply the feed to your vegetables when they are in most need of the extra fertility. This will be different for each crop, for example, tomatoes are best fed when they are setting fruit and then any time during the fruiting period. Applying comfert before this can be counter productive and make your plants more susceptible to pest problems. The black slurry at the bottom of the barrel can be dispersed evenly back over the comfrey patch. Liquid fertilizer concentrate – ‘Comfert Plus’ can also be made by packing fresh-cut comfrey tops into an old bucket, weighing them down with something heavy, covering tightly, and waiting a few weeks for them to decompose into a black slurry. You can put a hole in the bottom of the bucket and collect the concentrate in another container as it drips out. Dilute this comfrey concentrate about 15 to 1 with water, and use as you would comfert. You can seal this concentrate in plastic jugs until you are ready to use it. Warning! Comfert stinks like hell. My nieces came to visit from London last year and offered to help out in the market garden. One of the tasks that day was to apply comfert to the crops. Let’s just say it did not end well and we had a much better experience taking softwood cuttings the next day. According to Martin Crawford in Creating a Forest Garden: Working with Nature to Grow Edible Crops, one cut of comfrey from one plant contains 0.5g of Nitrogen (N) and 10g of potassium (K) to crops. Based on this I calculated how much Potassium (K), Nitrogen (N) and biomass the 13 m2 comfrey patch can potentially produce in a year. Below is a table indicating how many comfrey cuts are needed to meet the Nitrogen and Potassium needs of various moderate and heavy cropping fruit and nut trees and annual vegetables. In the 1960s, Lawrence D. Hills used UK gardeners records for a comfrey report. (See the Balkan Ecology Project blog for the results.) Based on these records I calculated a yield of approx. 5.5kg of biomass per plant each year. Using this figure one of our beds should produce approx 286kg of biomass. We shall see as this year we begin our own records. We’re looking to gather some solid data on how comfrey performs in our climate and we’ll be recording the yields from our patch starting this season and for at least the next five years. For more info on our record keeping and research programs see Polyculture Market Garden Study. If you would like to join the ‘who can grow the most comfrey’ experiment and contribute data to our records, send us an email. It will be great to have records from all over the world.

"Hugelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, means hill culture or hill mound. Instead of putting branches, leaves and grass clippings in bags by the curbside for the bin men… build a hugel bed. Simply mound logs, branches, leaves, grass clippings, straw, cardboard, petroleum-free newspaper, manure, compost or whatever other biomass you have available, top with soil and plant your veggies. The advantages of a hugel bed are many, including: The gradual decay of wood is a consistent source of long-term nutrients for the plants. A large bed might give out a constant supply of nutrients for 20 years (or even longer if you use only hardwoods). The composting wood also generates heat which should extend the growing season. Soil aeration increases as those branches and logs break down… meaning the bed will be no till, long term. The logs and branches act like a sponge. Rainwater is stored and then released during drier times. Actually you may never need to water your hugel bed again after the first year (except during long term droughts). Sequester carbon into the soil. On a sod lawn Sepp Holzer (hugelkultur expert) recommends cutting out the sod, digging a one foot deep trench and filling the trench with logs and branches. Then cover the logs with the upside down turf. On top of the turf add grass clippings, seaweed, compost, aged manure, straw, green leaves, mulch, etc…  Sepp Holzer recommends steep hugel beds to avoid compaction from increased pressure over time. Steep beds mean more surface area in your garden for plants and the height makes easy harvesting. The greater the mass, the greater the water-retention benefits. Hugel bed dug in clay with logs put in vertically, next branches and lots of wood chips. Top 6 inches will be wood chips and dirt. This bed will store water and give nutrients for many years to come. Straw bale gardens require less soil, less water and hold heat. As the straw breaks down nutrients feed the plants. Combining a straw surround with a hugel interior, topped by lasagne layering is an excellent idea for an area with poor quality soil. Hugel bed in Ontario, Canada (June 28th) by Tim Burrows. Tim surrounded his very tall hugel bed in pallets! Sheet mulching (lasagne gardening) is like composting in place. Above: just a suggestion as to sheet mulching layers. Nitrogen-rich material such as fresh grass clippings or green leaves put right on the hugelkultur wood would help jump start the composting process. Could also include seaweed, straw, dead leaves, leaf mould, etc.

The first year of break down means the wood (and fungi) steal a lot of the nitrogen out of the surrounding environment, so adding nitrogen during the first year or planting crops that add nitrogen to the soil (like legumes) or planting species with minimal nitrogen requirements is necessary, unless there is plenty of organic material on top of the wood. After the wood absorbs nitrogen to its fill, the wood will start to break down and start to give nitrogen back in the process. In the end you will be left with a beautiful bed of nutrient rich soil. Tree types that work well in hugelkultur:
Hardwoods break down slowly and therefore your hugel bed will last longer, hold water for more years and add nutrients for more years. But softwoods are acceptable as well, a softwood bed will just disintegrate quicker. Mixing woods with softwoods and branches on top, to give off nutrients first, and hardwoods on bottom, sounds like a plan if you have access to multiple types of wood. Yet the newly decomposing softwoods at the top will eat up a lot of nitrogen at first, so compensate for that.

Woods that work best:
Alders, apple, aspen, birch, cottonwood, maple, oak, poplar, willow (make sure it is dead or it will sprout).

Trees types that work okay:
Black cherry (use only rotted), camphor wood (well aged), cedar/juniper/yew (anti-microbial/anti-fungal, so use only at very bottom or unless already well-aged. Cedar should be broken down before new plant roots reach it), eucalyptus (slightly anti-microbial), osage orange (exceptionally resistant to decay), Pacific yew (exceptionally resistant to decay), pine/fir/spruce (tannins and sap), red mulberry (exceptionally resistant to decay).

Tree types to avoid:
Black locust (will not decompose), black walnut (juglone toxin), old growth redwood (heartwood will not decompose and redwood compost can prevent seed germination).

"Thistles are a bane of picnickers and campers. Who hasn’t trodden on the sharp, unforgiving spines of a thistle when out and about barefoot in grasslands? For many people, relationships with thistles have generally been painful and irritable, but now you can get your own back! One of the great things about thistles is that every single species is edible, so this is great news for foraging beginners! Even the closest lookalikes found here are edible – the sow thistles (Sonchus spp.) and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), so when working with the thistles, you can learn to identify and proceed to experiment with complete confidence from the outset. We have at least 14 species of thistle growing wild in the UK, mostly from the Cirsium (aka plume thistles) and Carduus genera. Thistles are found in numerous settings all over our islands and can be a useful soil barometer. Often their presence signifies that the land is fertile, and in many instances, neglected. I eat from a number of different species. These are: creeping thistle (Cirsium arvensis), spear thistle (C. vulgare), woolly thistle (C. eriophorum), marsh thistle (C. palustris), and welted thistle (Carduus acanthoides syn C. crispus). As you will discover, plants that have spines to offer protection against predators, have no real need for bitterness. Spear thistle It’s almost impossible to misidentify a thistle. One of the easy-to-spot botanical differences between thistles and their numerous relatives in the daisy family, is that the overlapping bracts (involucre) found directly below the flowers of thistles, are always spiny. Simple! The leaves of the numerous species will differ in size, shape and the density of spine coverage. Most have stiff spines on the margins, but some have soft prickles. You need to discover for yourself which are the more tactile! When in flower, most thistles produce a lovely purple / mauve bloom, but some species are known for their yellow inflorescence (cabbage thistle – Cirsium oleraceum and the Carline thistle – Carlina vulgaris). In all of the thistles, flowers give way to copious amounts of fluffy hairs (pappus) attached to their tiny fruits, superbly designed for air-borne dispersal. A distinguishing feature between the two main generais that Cirsium spp. produce feathered pappus hairs, whereas Carduus spp. only have simple pappus hairs. Creeping thistle produces dense spines on its leaves, but very few spines or hairs on the flowering stems. Spear thistle has large, deeply-lobed leaves with large spines at the margins, as well as hairy, spiny stems. Marsh thistle looks somewhat like spear thistle at an initial glance, but without the large spines and leaf lobes, and usually with a thin, red, leaf margin. Woolly thistle is easily identifiable with large, deeply-lobed, evenly-shaped leaves, and very large flower heads, wrapped in a ‘cobweb’ of cotton-like hairs. This particular species is the largest wild thistle I use, although if you have milk thistle (Silybum marianum) growing in your plot, you can use that too, but you will need good gloves to protect yourself from its long spiny flower heads! Eating milk thistle chokes would of course prevent you harvesting the exceptional liver-supportive medicine found in the seeds. Wooly thistle Creeping thistle will grow in all manner of waste-ground, grasslands, verges and field edges. I also see a lot of spear thistle in similar habitats, although when found in grassland, it’s not as abundant as the creeping species. The root systems explain why; spear thistle has a tap root, whereas creeping thistle grows on rhizomes. The marsh thistle, as its name alludes to, likes damp conditions such as fens, marshes, canal tow-paths and riversides. Woolly thistle is a little bit more selective in its choice of soil and setting, preferring calcareous ground. It too enjoys grasslands. Welted thistle can be found all over the UK, especially loving clay soils. Go prepared! Stiff gloves and a knife are required. Harvest the best leaf mid-ribs in spring when growth is plentiful and quick. Your specimens will be tender and sweeter. Flowering stems will appear from late spring through into autumn. I only consider harvesting from plants whose flower buds are yet to really begin unfurling. Flower buds (chokes) are available all summer. In Portugal, a number of thistle species are still collected in spring and sold at markets. A recent academic study highlighted the nutritional value from eating thistles. The findings are contained within ‘Ethnobotany In The New Europe’ by Manuel. P de Santayana et al. (Eds), published June 2010. In the study, researchers noted the wide range of thistle species collected, and concentrated on the nutritional value of one particular thistle (Scolymus hispanicus – Spanish or golden thistle). This plant is collected by villagers in various areas of the countryside. Bunches of the stripped leaf mid-ribs are sold and bought in a number of markets in different areas. Levels of certain nutrients were analysed and compared to some commonly consumed vegetables. Their findings show that the thistle contained consistently higher levels of important major nutrients than some of our commonly consumed cultivated vegetables. Weight for weight, thistles come out higher in fibre, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, copper, zinc and other nutrients. Is it likely that the thistles found wild here will be similarly endowed with a range of important vitamins and minerals? I’m more than happy to work on the assumption that this will be the case. Many other wild plant species are known to contain high concentrations of important nutrients. Preparing thistles is pretty easy. Simply choose the most tender specimens. If using the petioles, then cut and strip all the spines off, before peeling the outer, fibrous layer from the stalk. Use raw as crudités, pickle or ferment them, or chop into salads and serve them with a tangy vinaigrette. If cooking, they don’t require long! Preparing the stems is similar, but they are hollow. These can be used in similar ways to the petioles, or you can stuff them, roast them, and braise them. As relatives of the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus), thistles produce edible, if smaller, ‘chokes’. These are the crunchy, immature bases, or capitulum, of the composite flower-head. As you would do with globe artichokes, peel away the bracts to get to the prize. I only choose the largest wild species for this. Happy foraging!

"Some plants seem to be our constant companions, no matter where we live. Often, they will also be some of our really useful species. It will soon become clear that the common mallow (Malva sylvestris) is one of these plants. Rather than being looked upon as a weed, the mallows can be more usefully described as some of our gloriously abundant plant helpers. A number of mallow species have long been used as a food and medicine, wherever they are found native, and especially in the Middle East and Asia. You won’t have far to go to find the common mallow in most parts of Europe, North Africa and Southwest Asia either. Common mallow can be found growing erect or prostrate, which may initially cause confusion because it’s easy to assume they might be two different species. Mallow’s kidney-shaped or palmately-lobed leaves are notably creased, typically with dentate margins. The leaves often show a purple spot in the centre of the base of the leaf and this can also be seen to run down the petiole on some specimens. On other specimens, the purple spotting and colouring is completely absent. Mallow leaves have long petioles. Their deep green foliage hints at a renowned drought tolerance. During flowering, the leaves appear alternately on the stems. Holding a leaf relays the surface coarseness. But tear and crush one, and you discover a family pattern – the mucilage. You will soon experience a slimy and tacky feel between your fingers. All parts of the plant contain mucilage. In bloom, the Malvaceae family plants produce five large notched petals in each open flower. Common mallow has showy pink petals laced with darker-coloured strokes. In the centre of the flower lies a pollen-loaded column of fused stamens. This surrounds the stigma, which rises above the column.  Mallow is known to freely seed. The round seed pods, known as ‘cheeses’, soon follow flowering. These were once munched by children on their way to and from school. The pods are held on stalks, close to the flowering stem. Mallow will be found on most soils, from coastal to marginally upland habitats, with most settings being adequate for this resilient plant. It loves waste-ground as well as grassland; gravel as much as coastal edges, and waysides and roadsides as well as hedges.  Leaves, flowers, seed pods, roots. Leaves, in spring; flowers from late spring; seed pods from early summer. Roots could be harvested from larger rosettes whenever large enough. Medicinal and nutritional constituents Vitamins A,B,C,E; inulin; mucilage; phenols; flavonoids; essential fatty acids; fibre; calcium; magnesium; zinc; selenium; potassium. Traditional and contemporary uses As with many wild food plants, the common mallow has also had a long history of medicinal use. Due to its high mucilage content, mallows make excellent soothing demulcent herbs, especially for cases of inflammation, either for the urinary, digestive or respiratory systems. Pregnant women or new mothers may like to know that mallow leaves can provide useful amounts of iron, as well as being quite high in zinc and most vitamins.  All of the mallow family with exception to the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum), are reportedly edible. With their high mucilage content, the leaves can usefully be taken as an emergency antidote to irritation or burning that may be caused by the accidental consumption of acrid plants in the buttercup family. Creative cooks can substitute mallow for spinach in many dishes, including soups, salads, gnocchi and quiche. I have even flash-fried larger mallow leaves for just one second in hot oil to make ‘popadoms’. Mallow also makes a great addition to soups, whereby the mucilage helps to thicken them.  In Jewish culture, mallow has been been considered the ‘most important plant in local gather society’. Every spring mallow is gathered in the countryside. Its common name in both Hebrew and Arabic, translates to ‘bread’.  During the war of 1948, when Jerusalem was under siege, mallow was an important famine crop, and one that is still celebrated on Independence day every year with a traditional dish made from mallow leaves. Common mallow can be substituted for the family relative Corchorus olitorius aka ‘jutes mallow’, when making the Egyptian / Middle-Eastern dish ‘Molokhia’. This traditional dish is usually served with chicken.  In China, mallow roots are a popular and a common ingredient in making hearty, yet medicinally potent soups and broths. The inulin-rich tap roots of a number of different mallow species, including common mallow, have been used. The seed pods can be substituted for most of the egg white if wanting to make mallow meringues. Simply boil up the peeled seed pods using 3 parts water 1 part seed pods, and reduce the liquid by half. For every half cup of liquid add one egg white, ¼ tsp of cream of tartar, some vanilla and castor sugar, then whip it up until foamy and stiff, just like meringues.  21st Century Foraging  The Medicinal Forest Garden  The Fast Wild Food Cookbookby Johnny Jumbalaya  Amazing Moringa: Medicinal, Edible & Easy to Grow  How to Make your own Sloe Gin Chris Hope, aka Chris Phyto, was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic plant lover, forager and teacher, who sadly died in 2021.";Permaculture Magazine UK

Salt and pepper to taste For the garlic bread
A crusty loaf of bread 
4-10 cloves garlic (I like it strong!)
0.5-1 cup olive oil (it depends how large the loaf is)
Pepper
An oven dish approximately 25 x 25cm (10 x 10in) Preheat the oven to 180oC fan (200oC/400oF/gas mark 6). Finely chop the garlic and mix into the olive oil. Add a little pepper, stir and leave to infuse. Slice the aubergines and courgettes lengthways into 5mm thick slices. Pour some olive oil into the pan and soften the onions, garlic and celery on a low heat.  When cooked, add the red pepper, beans and tomatoes. Simmer for around 15 minutes until the sauce is cooked through. Meanwhile, drizzle olive oil onto a griddle and cook the aubergines and courgettes, several slices at a time, turning occasionally, for 3-4 minutes. Pour some of the tomato sauce into the oven dish, add a layer of aubergine, then more sauce, a layer of courgette, and so on until the dish is filled with layers of sauce, aubergine and courgette. Decorate with slices of tomato. Put in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Slice the bread so the knife goes about 90% through the loaf, leaving the base intact and the slices attached to each other. Put in a baking dish and, using a spoon, drizzle the garlic oil over both sides of each slice.  15 minutes before the lasagne is ready, put the bread in the oven. When the lasagne is cooked, remove from the oven and serve with the crusty garlic bread and a large salad, or dish of steamed seasonal green vegetables. Tip – Frying pan will work if you don’t have a griddle. This recipe adapts well to other vegetables. In the winter, use slices of cooked potato, parsnip, sweet potato or squash.

"My name is Suzanne Pendleton and I live in Swinton, Salford (UK) and have been involved in the Greater Manchester Swift Street initiative since August 2024, which has been led by the RSPB. During lockdown I started to value my time outside as so many families did too. I enjoyed time in our little garden more and spotted some birds as they zoomed and screamed over the house. I wasn’t quite sure what they were and asked my friend Kathleen who lived on a surrounding road what they might be. She enlightened me. They were Swifts, a species recently added to the UK’s Red List of birds, meaning they are now amongst our most threatened. Then the summer was over and the swifts left Swinton heading back to Africa.  Each year since, I have eagerly anticipated the return of the Swifts. My understanding grew and I learnt of their declining numbers, now less than 60,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Along with developing a stiff neck constantly looking up to the sky, watching their incredible aerial manoeuvres.  I am privileged to live in a friendly neighbourhood on our lane. The community are always up for helping, and we pull together to help each other. We have a community messaging service which came into its own in lockdown, and continues to be a fabulous way to share information and request help and advice. During the last few years I had messaged our community group and asked if anyone knew about our Swifts and where they were nesting. Initially we were unsuccessful in understanding, but in spring 2024 we struck lucky and finally worked out the eaves where they lived. I’d also discovered Swift Mapper (an app for recording the location of Swift nesting sites) enabling us to understand we had four nest sites on the Lane and surrounding roads.  We also realised that there was another small colony locally less that 1/4 mile away. Last August, a resident of this local road got in touch to say Roshni (Parmar-Hill, Community Engagement Officer) from the RSPB had been to visit their colony. She asked if we’d be interested in getting involved with developing our Swift Street – thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery – and I eagerly accepted the offer. We used our community messaging group to share the news of the Swift Street development and I was overwhelmed by the local response. So many families were keen to help our Swift population, with more than 80 boxes requested. I think the consensus was that we are so privileged that these incredible urban birds choose our lane as their home, and as their nesting places can be threatened by redevelopment, having the opportunity to install boxes is a wonderful chance to do something proactive to help.  Roshni and I visited local homes who had expressed interest, helping families select potential sites for their boxes to be positioned. With Roshni’s guidance we talked about what Swifts need and I and residents began to understand more about how Swifts live. They are remarkably compatible with humans, don’t need a bird bath, bird table etc. as they feed on insects on the wing. I discovered along with other residents that the best way we could help our Swifts was to protect their current nesting sites, add boxes for more birds to nest in and to do all we could to support insect populations. For example, considering planting in our gardens to promote insect life, adopting No Mow May and not using insecticides. Those who weren’t able to install a box could instead help in other ways, so this made the project accessible for all – everyone could join in. Next came the production of the boxes. Roshni contacted local colleges and we were thrilled when a local skills centre suggested their joinery students could make these free of charge. Production began and numbers of those interested had grown as the message about the project spread, and so 100 boxes were produced.  Meanwhile, local guiding groups learnt of the initiative and Roshni visited the groups that I lead, as Brown Owl – 90 girls and young women were keen to learn about Swifts and how they could help. The groups were already keen to learn about environmental matters, and this project really whetted their appetite. The Brownies, Guides and Rangers designed posters, made seed bombs and grew in their understanding of our Swifts. Once the production of the boxes was finished the Brownies, Rangers and Guides got stuck into painting them with an environmentally friendly product which would protect the boxes, and a local lady Haldis (a RSPB Swift Champion, a voluntary role which supports local conservation efforts to protect the species) made the nest cups which would be inserted into each box.  We arrived at installation day on Saturday 8th March, with 25 boxes going up on that first day. By the end of March, 80 had been erected by a local roofer, Ryan. Of course, we needed to celebrate the returning of our precious Swifts and so we began planning our community event. Volunteers came forward from the surrounding roads and we met in a resident’s kitchen each Wednesday, so all could contribute ideas. Other local guiding groups wanted to contribute and so they made nature-themed bunting, and we were thrilled when the church on the lane offered their venue as a space for us to celebrate. The local dance and drama group wanted to be involved and so their leaders and young people planned songs and a drama production with poetry. And as if we weren’t already exciting enough, we then heard the news that RSPB Ambassador Megan McCubbin would love to come along to formally open our Swift Street.  We were blessed with glorious sunshine on 17th May, with a fantastic community event. Sixty families made bee hotels, children had Swift-themed face paint, and a plant swap was popular. RSPB provided and led crafts, and local artists supported youngsters to make Swift puppets. More than 300 residents attended and watched the young people perform. The ribbon was cut revealing a beautiful Swift Street banner created by a local artist, alongside Swift boxes 99 and 100 positioned proudly on the front of the church. And yes, we had Swifts soaring high above us all day (perhaps watching the proceedings?) to the delight of the watching children and residents. As the street party continued into the evening we couldn’t believe our eyes when a ‘banger’ (a young Swift, which gets its name from its tendency to bang against prospective nest to check if they’re occupied or not) attempted to enter one of the newly positioned boxes. A perfect end to a fabulous day.  It’s been an absolute honour to be involved in this project and I feel so lucky that our community have been able to do something practical to support our local Swifts.

"We are delighted to announce the recipients of the 2025 Permaculture Magazine Award, in collaboration with Lush Spring Prize. Four projects have been awarded from a fund of £25,000. The Permaculture Magazine Award is a celebration of the vital work of permaculture projects from around the world. The Permaculture Magazine Award was established in 2018 to celebrate the vital work of permaculture projects around the world. To date (May 2025) it has awarded 28 projects with over £155,000. The award has received hundreds of applications, and it is a privilege to highlight this vital regenerative work that is world changing. Coordinating a network of permaculture centres, NGO Permaculture Ukraine offers training, events and educational resources across Ukraine, also ensuring accessibility for internally displaced people (IDP) and former military personnel. The organisation was founded following the first Permaculture Design Course (PDC) in Ukraine in 2011, and has held at least one PDC annually, actively seeking funding to make training accessible to vulnerable groups. Following the full-scale invasion in 2022, its focus expanded to include: The 14 permaculture centres provide training, shelter for IDPs and war-abandoned animals, and rehabilitation for children and adults. Its designers also create communal projects, including schools and homes for disabled people. Despite air raids and blackouts, NGO Permaculture Ukraine successfully hosted a two-day permaculture festival in Kyiv’s botanical garden in September 2024, drawing 100 participants eager to engage with top regenerative practitioners. NGO Permaculture Ukraine empowers Ukrainians for sustainable living and transformative change. Through active social media engagement and collaborations with ecovillages, zero-waste networks, and other ecological movements, it extends its influence and inspires a growing audience to adopt permaculture principles for Ukraine’s regeneration. https://permaculture.in.ua Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design. It seeks to ensure the survival of the village, which is at risk due to an ageing population. Through permaculture, Battmung aims to bring its village back to life. It offers a 72-hour Permaculture Design Course (PDC) to youth and those who go on to become active designers stay connected through the Battmung Friends group. Since its founding in 2021, Battmung has: Recognising the importance of connecting people, Battmung also contributed to the founding of the Permaculture Institute of Korea (P.I.K) in 2023. Its goal is to organise its regional network and regenerate South Korea through permaculture, restoring soil, food chains, ecological awareness, and local economies. www.instagram.com/battmung.log Eco Centro Allpa Tarpuna works for the regeneration of degraded lands, food sovereignty and community autonomy, with a focus on indigenous communities in Ecuador. Founded in 2004, it was born out of the return of its founders to their community after experiencing the negative impacts of conventional agriculture and agrochemicals. This return marked the beginning of a path towards reconnecting with indigenous ancestral knowledge and adopting permaculture and organic production. One of the key achievements has been the recovery of soils degraded by monocultures and eucalyptus. Although slow, this process has demonstrated the benefits of a regenerative approach and strengthened the resilience of the community. Allpa Tarpuna is currently focusing on: Allpa Tarpuna integrates bio-construction, renewable energy and sustainable water management into its practices. It also encourages the preservation of ancestral seeds and agro-ecological techniques such as crop rotation, reducing dependence on chemicals. In the future, it wants to expand its training in permaculture design, combining indigenous knowledge with modern regenerative solutions. It seeks to empower more local farmers, promoting designs that restore the connection between people and nature. Allpa Tarpuna is a living indigenous family that sows regeneration, inspiring a sustainable and resilient balance. https://allpatarpuna.org HortaFCUL is a community-based permaculture project based in Lisbon University’s Faculty of Sciences (FCUL). The initiative was launched by a group of biology students concerned about the gap between sustainability ideals and the university’s environmental impact. This bottom-up project has developed an important role as a catalyst of practical scientific-based knowledge. Nowadays, HortaFCUL is a resilient, sustainable and inclusive community, allowing the general public to learn more about nature-based solutions. It has five subprojects at campus level and relies on a volunteer-based horizontally-organised guardians collective to maintain the project’s green areas. HortaFCUL, as a permaculture project, achieves its central goals by closing functional loops related to human activities.

"As politicians wait, grassroots changemakers are restoring ecosystems and rebuilding resilience. They are living examples that regeneration is not just possible, it’s already happening all over the world.  The Lush Spring Prize 2025 is showcasing this work and has awarded around £250,000 to 19 groups, celebrating regenerative organisations and practitioners from around the world. Lead image: Clockwise from top left: Agro-Pueblos (Colombia), Ñu’u Ndito (Mexico), Global Ecovillage Network (Global), Land in Our Names (UK) In a joyous, collaborative and inspiring week of celebrations, the 2025 recipients were honoured as part of a celebratory event held in Dorset (UK), where the Lush Cosmetics company is headquartered. The event was attended by prize recipients, Spring Prize judges, Lush staff, press, funders and other regenerative practitioners. Co-designed with the prize recipients themselves, the event provides a space to connect, co-learn and share stories of regeneration. It offered an opportunity to explore both the diversity of people and organisations that make up the regenerative movement and the common challenges, learnings and successes that unites it. Each Spring Prize year sees different themes emerge that are shaped by the organisations that receive a prize. In 2025, these include the importance of weaving ancestral wisdom with scientific approaches; working at multiple scales and legally recognising the rights of nature, and learning from those on the frontlines that are facilitating regenerative work in conflict zones or regions experiencing natural disasters. In 2025, the backdrop of violence and conflict looms large. Prize recipients from Lebanon and Ukraine are responding to invasions by powerful aggressors, in Myanmar they are working in a context of ongoing internal conflict and many of the Indigenous groups are frequently facing the threat of violence.  The Spring Prize 2025 event allows these groups to come together and share what regenerative work in these situations looks like in a way that may challenge the existing narrative: “In the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the biggest achievement for our organisation is to continue our activities and find ways to be useful for Ukrainian society like creating permaculture public spaces and rehabilitating people in our demonstration centers. The war has taught us that strength is in unity and networks, that autonomous homesteads and farms that grow their own food and preserve their seeds can not only survive but also help other people, and that international support and networks matter.” NGO Permaculture in Ukraine While humanity witnesses declining biodiversity, climate catastrophes and widespread conflict, these organisations highlight how regenerative practices are not just a source of hope but a necessary and much needed response.

Examples of this year’s awarded projects include: Aguaje palm tree seedlings were distributed among Kukama families in Parinari, Loreto, Peru, as part of the reforestation and conservation initiative led by Huaynakana. Extractivism represents a constant threat to the Kukama territory in Peru and the loss of the Kukama peoples’ cultural identity. Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana exists to protect this. The Kukama people conceive of the territory as a whole and women having an intrinsic connection to it. The term ‘kukama’ for example is composed of two words: ‘ku’ meaning ‘field’ and ‘kama’ meaning ‘bosom,’ and it signifies ‘field-bosom’ or ‘nourished by the field.’ Given the Kukama peoples’ lives are reliant on the forest ecosystems of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and considering how they have adapted and coexisted with them for decades, the territory and the rivers are inseparable from their culture and way of life. They consider the rivers to be living beings with spirits, and therefore sacred. Founded in 2001, Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana embarked on a long journey of collective actions, protests, and mobilisations in pursuit of environmental justice as the river’s health declined as a result of extractive industries. In September 2021 Huaynakana filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognise the Marañón River as a living being and subject of rights. In March 2024, the provincial court of Nauta ruled that the Marañón River has intrinsic rights, including the right to flow, to be free from pollution, and to be restored to environmental health. This decision also recognised Indigenous communities as the river’s legal representatives, defenders, and guardians. This landmark ruling was ratified by the higher court last November. Huaynakana plays a key role in defending the Marañón’s rights and supporting the regeneration and conservation of the waterways through reforestation efforts because without the river, these unique forests cannot exist. Mushrooms harvested from the Ubuntu food forest Ubuntu Learning Hub Trust was set up in 2022 with a mission to support people who are in transition towards more resilient futures and a healthier planet. The Trust immediately began to set up the Ubuntu Learning Centre as an open learning space for all ages as well as a demonstration centre for integrating technologies that are in tune with a healthy Mother Earth. The learning centre sits on a two-hectare site in Chikancila village in Chongwe district of Lusaka Province of Zambia. It is founded on the African philosophy of Ubuntu which helps people to learn what it means to be truly human. It hosts people from all walks of life who are looking for pathways to escape the rat race and curve more sustainable futures for themselves, their families and the communities where they come from. The Trust uses agro-ecological practices to regenerate the degraded farmland that was damaged over decades of poor land husbandry. For example, the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) technique has helped to restore much of the indigenous vegetation on the land. People come to Ubuntu to explore the meaning of life and to find their life purpose. They stay at Ubuntu for varying lengths of time and in the process they are engaged in intercultural exchanges as well as learning how to take care of themselves and of Mother Earth. The Trust offers life changing experiences rather than certificates and the opportunity to carve out an earth-centred worldview for themselves.

The Cultural Conservancy (TCC) is a Native-led non-profit organisation based in San Francisco, California. Founded in 1985, its mission is to protect and revitalise Indigenous cultures through the direct application of traditional knowledge and practices on ancestral lands. It works with Native/Indigenous peoples locally and globally on community-based projects that are shaped by community requests and guided by the Native Advisory Council of Traditional Knowledge Holders, land-care practitioners, and community leaders. From language revitalisation and traditional carving projects to Indigenous agricultural sciences and traditional land tending, critical to its work is the acknowledgement of the sacred relationship Native peoples have to their lands and waters and the importance of this relationship to their physical, mental, and community health. Through its flagship Native Foodways Programme and its land project Heron Shadow, it: Battmung was founded to create a sustainable permaculture village in South Korea where young people can thrive and learn about permaculture design.

Harvesting with Battmung friends The LUSH Spring Prize is a joint venture between LUSH Cosmetics and Ethical Consumer and is now in its sixth prize cycle, having started in 2017. The Spring Prize has distributed more than £1.3 million to regenerative projects worldwide. The LUSH Spring Prize was set up to support ‘regenerative’ projects – those that go beyond sustainability by taking holistic approaches to building the health of ecology, economy and social systems. It seeks to support those who are leaving the world lusher than they found it, and are actively restoring all the systems they are part of. By supporting regenerative projects the Spring Prize hopes to raise the profile of the movement as a whole to inspire more individuals, groups, communities, funders, media platforms and businesses to start engaging with regenerative processes.  The Spring Prize judging panels are made up of people drawn from a diverse range of movements that represent regenerative design, permaculture, food sovereignty, transition towns, biomimicry, eco-village networks and various social justice movements. Each prize cycle a ‘Lush Customer Judge’ and ‘Lush Staff Judge’ are also selected to act as additional independent members of the judging panel.  The collaborative prizes have separate panels, which also include judges from the main Spring Prize panel. The majority of the judging panel for the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Award self identify as Indigenous themselves, some being previous recipients of the award. The judges are not just involved in choosing the recipients but are involved in shaping the prize as a whole, attending the event and connecting with prize recipients.

"Around 40 years ago, the Sahel, an extremely arid region located in central Africa, was an area of agricultural desolation. Due to natural factors such as heavy drought and interannual variability, combined with anthropocentric influences like climate change, overgrazing and deforestation, the environment has become particularly unstable with little possibility for productivity.  Furthermore, when rain does fall in the arid region, the soil is so dry due to a lack of precipitation, that water immediately ‘runs off’ or evaporates, failing to soak into the depleted earth. Some countries within the region, such as Burkina Faso, faced up to 24% of their arable lands classed as highly degraded in 1998 (Maatman et al., 1998).  In the early 2000s, NGOs and organisations such as the United Nations, the World Food Programme and WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies), amongst others, sought to reverse the desertification of many parts of Africa, including the Sahel, in cooperation with farmers and communities from the affected regions. Using the ancient ‘half moon’ water harvesting technique – used for centuries in Africa and the Middle East, the revitalised technique aims to facilitate water retention and re-green the ecosystem. Heavy machinery or hand tools can be used to plough the soil roughly 30cm down in a semi-circle or ‘half moon’ shape. The diameter of these half moons are typically about 4 metres. When it rains, the contours catch the rainwater, preventing runoff and allowing it to infiltrate the soil. This creates ‘favourable micro-climate conditions’ allowing drought-resistant crops such as sorghum and millet to be planted.  If planted on steep slopes, half-moon ‘bunds’ can assist the growth of tree species. They can also be used in combination with controlled grazing to boost re-vegetation. In Niger, The World Food Programme (WFP) has been implementing half-moon planting projects since 2014. Just 5 years into the scheme, the benefits of its implementation were examined by a progress-review. In 2019, over 400 households had restored approximately 3,000 acres of land, largely for use in producing food for livestock. This has promoted social cohesion and economic growth by providing more jobs and stabilising agricultural output in a formerly capricious climate. This scenario exhibits the benefits of a localised, small-scale regenerative farming technique such as half-moon planting through its trickle-down effects, stipulating broader socio-economic growth. A study on the impact of reformed agroecological techniques was conducted from 2013 to 2015 in Burkina Faso. Figures revealed that fields ploughed using the half-moon method saw the rates of increase for grain yield at 8% (The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 2017). As farmers sought new ways to boost crop yields, regenerative farming techniques such as the half-moon method were found to be successful when used in conjunction with others. In Burkina Faso, half-moon planting is exercised alongside the Zaï technique, which is useful when adapting to various soil types and structures. The Zaï method, suitable to the arid Sahel region, uses similar methods seen in the half-moons, but alternatively involves digging smaller pits in non-permeable soil to intercept water and gather compost material. These pits are slightly smaller than the half-moons and so are less labour intensive and can be utilised in smaller growing plots. They are roughly between 15-50cm across; 5-15cm deep; and positioned 80cm apart. This technique was reintroduced to the area in the 1980s by farmer and agronomist Yacouba Sawadogo, who pioneered the method of filling the holes with manure to further break up the earth and bolster soil productivity.

"Traditional Māori time systems were measured in accordance to the night as opposed to the Western proxy of daylight. Each night of the lunar month had a particular name and this cumulatively formed a lunar calendar known as ‘Maramataka‘. Farming according to the Maramataka lunar calendar is used in conjunction with Māori regenerative farming techniques to adapt to nature’s schedule as opposed to imposing controls on the earth’s processes. Many farmers are now seeking to turn back to these ancient methods in line with broader sustainability imperatives. Under the Maramataka calendar, individual lunar nights were marked according to how optimal they were for catching fish, eels or planting crops, with each night having its own name. A good example is eel fishing. It is not productive on a full moon – Rākaunui – because the moon’s light would not allow eel to hunt their prey, as the prey could see them. As with biodynamics (the Rudolf Steiner lunar approach for farming), planting crops is nest at a full moon, when the gravitational pull is at its highest, because it has maximum influence on water in the soil. “Despite the use of Maramataka being limited to a relative few today, largely because of colonisation, interest in and revival of this knowledge and practice is growing.”1 Many farmers are returning to the use of farming tactics such as Maramataka planting in line with broader regenerative goals. The Revitalise Te Taiao programme aims to fund sustainable and lucrative agribusiness solutions to cultivate Te Taiao (the natural world). This project provided $2.7 million in funding to Miru Young and Mohi Beckham, farmers based in the North Island’s Bay of Plenty, to trial agriculture techniques which aim to “enhance the mana and mauri of the soil” across 10 farm sites. As part of the scheme, both farmers undertook rigorous research, sowing pasture throughout different moon phases from resting and dormant phases to high-energy phases for plant growth. Soon, grass seeds sown during the high energy periods of the Maramataka calendar outgrew neighbouring crops planted in other phases, even if the latter had been sown 10 days before. Despite still being in the trial stages of Maramataka planting, Miru and Mohi observed various positive impacts of the scheme within the first few months. Their land has seen higher productivity and crop yields, with a 93% crop survival rate under Maramataka planting, that is an increase of 13% from the usual 80% under previous methods. One of the main issues associated with returning to traditional farming methods on a broader scale is competing with intensive methods in New Zealand’s modern agricultural industry. After settlers from the West arrived in New Zealand during the 18th and 19th centuries, intensive farming practices quickly became widespread.  As farming in the country has continuously expanded into the modern day, with agricultural exports making up a large proportion of the country’s GDP, traditional farming methods have become far less lucrative in the broader market. This meant that Māori farmers had to adopt newer techniques, as those trying to maintain the traditional methods were faced with far lower crop yields and income. Rural management programmes and sustainability objectives are constantly investigating new and feasible ways to rejuvenate te ao Māori farming techniques, with the Revitalise Te Taiao programme representing just one of many schemes. The Maramataka lunar calendar is part of a broader Maori worldview known as Mātauranga Māori – a term used to describe the collective knowledge of Māori living in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and the knowledge passed down from their ancestors. Kaitiakitanga (stewardship/management) and the link between Whakapapa (Māori genealogy/ancestral descent) and Whenua (land) are key areas of te ao Māori and Mātauranga values.  By embracing schools of thought that are native to Aotearoa, alongside promoting equitable stewardship across modern farming methodologies, high agricultural output can be attained. Reforming the agribusiness in New Zealand will involve reintegrating Māori into decision making processes, embracing cross-cultural thought processes and utilising western technological advancements for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.

This will be a jam-packed conference weekend filled with workshops, demonstrations, panel discussions, presentations, art and celebration, co-created by the Seed Sovereignty Team. Come and see us in the Permaculture Area at the Green Gathering this August! Join us for four days of low impact living in an area of outstanding beauty, every corner bursting with music, creativity, natural abundance and community spirit. Intimate solar stages host up and coming acts, festival legends, DJs and spellbinding spoken word. The original off-grid, non-profit festival: we’re powered by sun, wind, people and passion for change. Share wisdom and skills; find friends old and new; weave, weld and tell stories. Put the world to rights - and then dance all night. There are many different courses you can take, with a range of different teachers who have specialized in different areas. You can learn online, face to face or a combination of both. Connecting with other permaculture people is at the heart of People Care! Here you will find events run by the Permaculture Association and our members; find a workshop or event near you! Visiting or volunteering at a permaculture project is one of the BEST ways to learn about permaculture and its a great way to find people who think differently and put their ideas into action! After a couple of courses, the permaculture idea takes root and a small group of dedicated people work hard to establish permaculture in the UK. The inaugural AGM was held and dreams were dreamt. The concept is in sharp contrast to the consumerist vision of Thatcher's Britain. We are pioneers, visionaries and innovators - and we love nature. The first newsletter imagines root and branch reform for a re-designed Britain. Our impact story starts here. Permaculture is being tested in many places now. The Permaculture Magazine starts, the Permaculture Plot is published and contains visitable projects, mostly Association members. The Diploma gets established and we set up our first website. People can access permaculture resources more easily, there are far more courses running and national events attract hundreds of people. The Association starts its first partnership work with other organisations like the Federation of City Farms and Women’s Environmental Network. Groups and projects are popping up all over the UK and the Association starts to do more research about the results of permaculture - which look good! We host the International Permaculture Conference in with attendees from countries. The LAND network has Centres and permaculture is well established and gets mentions on the telly. We launch our first Annual Impact Report, and start work with the Ecological Citizen’s Network, who are fascinated by the work we have done over years. Apparently we are pioneers and doing essential work to help citizen’s take action, transform farms and gardens, and set a new course for society - a future in harmony with nature! Over the coming months we are working with them to imagine what the Association needs to do over the next years to have the biggest impact. Read more about out impact here.";Permaculture Association

My goal with these projects is to give people access to the resources I wish had been available when I first started to learn permaculture about this stuff, way back in the 1990’s. We didn’t have much in the way of internet then, and Facebook hadn’t even been invented yet. So we used the library and good old fashioned hands-on trial and error to figure stuff out.
If humanity has a snowball’s chance at survival in the coming climate cataclysm, it will be permaculture tools and techniques that get us out of this mess. But we need to get on it, NOW, and it pains me to see finances preventing people from experiencing the joy and fascination that comes with learning permaculture. So I’m doing something about it.
Here you’ll find suggestions for learning permaculture for free, and also for finding ways to fund your permaculture education. I only make suggestions based on what I, myself have done and continue to do.
But before you read any more of this article, go and enroll yourself in this course.
Designed specifically for folks who don’t have a lot of time or money, this course will give you one bite-sized class per week for a full year, taking you step-by-step through a permaculture design process, focused on your own home, garden, and community.
I know, this is so obvious. And you already know there are a bunch of amazing permaculture books that you can get at the library. But did you know you can download a ton of excellent reading material, including some full-text PDFs of the best books about permaculture? Ok maybe you know that too. But where do you start? It’s overwhelming.
To help cut out the noise, I’ve selected a handful of super-value texts to get you started.
Food Not Lawns was born out of the “Sustainable Horticulture” study group we had going at our house in Eugene. We met up every week and discussed texts — like a book club, but with more dirt! We often had our meetings in somebody’s garden, where we could discuss ideas while pulling weeds. Stacking functions! Now that we have the internet, there are so many excellent study groups online. Again, it’s overwhelming, and some of the Facebook permaculture groups aren’t really that helpful. (In fact, as bizarre as it seems, several of the largest Facebook permaculture groups are run by internet trolls, unfortunately! So be careful!)
Here are the forums I created and moderate.";Permaculture Women's Guild
"If there is someone in your community whose work you admire, approach them and volunteer to help. We can learn so much from help each other, and through respecting and seeking out the wisdom of our elders.
And, if you are are a wise elder, consider looking for an young’un to pass your skills on to.
Maybe you know a lot about something besides permaculture, but you want to learn permaculture? How about setting up a skillshare with somebody?
Most of the permaculture teachers I know LOVE doing exchanges like this. If you can’t think of anyone in your own area, start hanging out at the farmer’s market. Or, check out our faculty and see if one of those folks inspires you to reach out.
This one is obvious too, but it cannot be overstated. You can take a dozen expensive design courses and still have no idea what you’re talking about. You have to get out there and start designing! Beyond designing, it’s important that you get dirty and do some serious implementation. Only through years of hard-won experiential knowledge will you ever truly master the fine art and science of permaculture design.
The good news is, implementing permaculture design projects is pretty much the funnest thing ever! This publication you’re reading right now, Permaculture Women Magazine, is packed full of hands-on ideas to help you find new ways to get your hands dirty with permaculture. Type any keyword into the search box and see what you find!
Ok, I know this whole article is supposed to be about learning permaculture without having to attend an expensive design course. And I’m a very critical, skeptical person myself. But I have to say, a good permaculture design course, taught by knowledgeable people who have taken the time to learn not just how to do permaculture but also how to teach it…well it can completely change your life.
And there are ways to pay for it. I’ve known tons of students who did a gofundme with friends and family to come up with tuition money, offering the reward of teaching free workshops to funders afterwards.
Others, like myself, leveraged existing community projects to get funding from the local municipality. Back in 2001, after two years of being super visible and growing gorgeous gardens all over the neighborhood, Food Not Lawns got a grant from the City of Eugene to pay Jude Hobbs and Toby Hemenway to do a 72-hour certification course for myself and twenty neighbors. It was awesome!
Most cities have little bits of funding for stuff like this, and if you frame it right, you can raise money to hire top-quality teachers and still be able to offer training for free to yourself and your friends.
What I am saying is: think outside the box. You’re a designer now, you can do this.
Meawhile, enroll in this free course–you’ll be amazed at how intensive it is!
See you in there!";Permaculture Women's Guild

(Mainly UK-focused, though many aspects applicable to other countries too.)
Since becoming very unwell and disabled nearly two years ago, I have learnt very quickly about what it means to be a person with disabilities attempting to navigate everyday life — and within that life, being unable to access many of the things I had previously taken for granted. Given that permaculture knowledge, experience, events and demonstration sites were previously a big part of my life, I have become increasingly aware of how difficult it would be for me to now access many of these things; in some cases it would be impossible. If I can’t participate in these events that are so important in my life, I wondered how many other people are also struggling to engage and connect with permaculture because of chronic illness and/or disability.
As I started thinking about this in more depth, I set up a Facebook group with the intention of connecting with other people in the permaculture community with chronic illness and/or disability. (CI/D).
(Recently, after some discussion in the Facebook group, it was decided that it made sense to add “neurodiversity” to the name and themes of the group too. The topic of neurodiversity inclusion isn’t discussed in this article, as the decision to add neurodiversity to the subject content in the Facebook group was made once I had started writing this post up. Many of the issues mentioned here — though not all of them — will also be relevant to neurodivergent people)
If at this point you need more information about the definitions of chronic illness and disability then please see the links shared in “Designing Solutions”, further on in this article.
In addition to setting up the group, I went on to openly ask some questions about accessing permaculture for people with CI/D in several UK focused Facebook groups about permaculture and also via a post on the Permaculture Association (Britain) online noticeboard. People were invited to respond to the following questions, either in public in the group or by emailing me. In total, 47 people (mainly from the UK) responded in one of these ways. The aim of this information-gathering was to access reflections on experiences; it was a place to start a conversation rather than to undertake a structured research project.
Here are the summaries and direct (anonymous) quotes of the responses to each question.
(This article is quite lengthy, as I wanted to be able to include the voices of as many people as possible.)
1) Do you identify as having a chronic illness and/or disability?
A diverse range of chronic illnesses and/or disabilities were included in the response to this question. These included physical illnesses, mental illnesses, learning disabilities (including dyslexia) and physical disabilities. Several people were keen to include neurodiversity as a disability too, as they pointed out that the education and benefits systems in the UK treat it as such. Many people also said that their illness and/or disability was a ‘hidden’ one, meaning that other people couldn’t immediately tell if the person with the chronic illness and/or disability had extra needs. A common theme evolved around many people feeling disabled by their environment, which frequently does not allow differently abled people to participate in life as they need to or would like to. Anyone has the potential to have additional needs and people with chronic illness and/or disability should be accepted to self define this, and not judged by others in doing so.
Some people who responded didn’t identify as having a CI/D, though they had witnessed the experiences of people with CI/D accessing permaculture events and demonstration sites.
2) Do you have examples of where accessing permaculture knowledge, demonstration sites and events have been adapted to the needs of someone with a chronic illness and/or disability? This might be your own needs, or someone else you have observed being supported well.
Several people mentioned great examples of how their needs relating to CI/D had been met at a variety of permaculture events and sites. These included:
There were also a couple of examples of places that had easily accessible compost toilets.
Some statements made were:
3) Have you, or anybody else you have witnessed, been unable to access permaculture knowledge and/or demonstration sites and/or events because of your chronic illness and/or disability?
Some statements that reflect general themes were:
The attitudes of other people
Many people have health conditions where their symptoms are variable. Some found that the lack of understanding about this meant that they felt uncomfortable and judged if they couldn’t join in with an activity when the previous day they had been able to. Some examples given were:
Physical space
Event activities
4) What changes could be made in order for you, or other people with chronic illness and/or disability, to be able to further access permaculture knowledge and/or demonstration sites and/or events?
General themes
One very common theme emerging from the reflections people shared with me is that permaculture should be about designing systems that showcase inclusivity.
Attitudes
Physical space
Activities
Designing solutions
Although every person with CI/D is an individual with unique experiences and needs, there are some common symptoms, issues and requirements for many folk. The following easily accessible resources are some favourites of mine, and can help you to understand more about these.
The Mighty — online community of support and awareness raising about disability, disease and mental health.
Stickman Communications — communicating about disability with style and humour
Chronic Illness Inclusion Project
Permaculture, Chronic Illness, Neurodiversity and Disability Facebook group
Suggestions to improve access to permaculture knowledge, events and demonstration sites in general in the permaculture community/movement
Top tips for permaculture events/courses facilitators and permaculture demonstration sites
This article and its suggestions have been designed to act as a starting point for further discussions and design work around access to permaculture for people with chronic illness and/or disability. Over the next few weeks, I will also be recording a spoken-voice version of the article content for my planned YouTube channel. I openly welcome feedback and /or suggestions for further blog posts/articles. Feel free to contact me by email or via my social media platforms.

If you live in the city, that doesn’t mean you can’t grow your own fruits and veggies! By using a few simple strategies, you can enjoy fresh homegrown fruits and veggies, year round.
If you’re renting, and especially if you live in an apartment, it might seem impossible to create the permaculture project where you are. But don’t be discouraged! The vast majority of our students AND our faculty are renters, and you can do A LOT without ever owning a place.
Let’s get practical! It’s all fine and good to cultivate a designer’s mind, but we also want you to feel empowered to jump in and get dirty, no matter where you live now.
Here are some skills that will come in handy for every urban dweller who wants to grow their own food:
1. Master the art of container gardening. Container plants have their own special needs, but it’s a short learning curve and you can make containers out of just about anything, and place them just about anywhere, and get an abundance of food, flowers, and medicine. (We’ll circle back to this later on in the class.)
2. Grow your own worms. Worm compost makes a perfect addition to a container garden, and also gives you a handy place to dump your kitchen compost. A tiny worm farm is super fun to make and produces a large amount of fertility.
3. Growing in a small space? Grow small plants. Choose dwarf fruit trees and keep them pruned. Grow short-season vegetables and choose varieties that produce when plants are still small.
4. Maximize vertical opportunities. Grow edible vining plants like kiwi, grapes, passionfruit, or hops, and grow them up (and down) the sides of buildings, fences, and freeway overpasses. A tiny piece of ground can produce massive vines.
5. Meet the Neighbors. If you don’t have access to garden space, look around and see who does. Maybe they want to share, and you can grow food together. Or maybe your whole apartment building can rally the landlord and get a project happening on the roof!
6. Integrate with the existing landscape. Is there a local park? Maybe you can commandeer a sunny corner and start a neighborhood garden. Even a parking strip with some scrubby shrubs can be a good spot to plant a few zucchini or potatoes, and you might be surprised how much food you get!
7. Bridge the gap. Once in a while, if you can, hop on a bus, head out to a local organic farm, and do some volunteering. You will get immediate access to a community of humans who care deeply for the Earth and you may discover you have a lot more access to land than you realized!";Permaculture Women's Guild

As part of my portfolio of designs for my Diploma in Applied Permaculture Design, one of my favourite design created was a Reflection and Planner Journal , (This link isn’t accessible on a mobile phone). This tool totally changed the way that I achieved the goals and intentions I set in my life and work. I have used versions of this design ever since. I also know that several friends have also used their own versions of the tool as well, with really positive feedback.
 
One thing I found when I first became very unwell and unable to work, last year, was that my Reflection and Planner Journal no longer felt as useful. The large spaces to fill on the pages, plus some of the content, was a constant reminder about how much my life had adversely changed through my illness. In addition the A4 size paper was becoming more and more difficult to physically manage to use as my movement, even when resting in bed, was very limited.
 
So I set about on a redesign! — I wanted one easily accessible place where I could record plans, ideas, reflections and resources ,using a variety of creative ways of documenting.
​
A friend had introduced me to the concept of Bullet Journaling several months before and I’d been considering it as something that I could well adapt to suite my own needs. Many commercially produced ‘Dot Journals’ typically used in bullet journaling, are A5 size, which means much easier accessibility in relation to my health needs.
I’m a keen fan of Looby Macnamara’s ‘Design Web’- the Design Process at the core of her book People and Permaculture, for anything related to using permaculture design as a way of improving our own lives. So it was an obvious choice for me to use the Design Web to guide the design of my new Planner & Reflection Tool.
First of all, I decided to name my new Planner and Reflection Tool a ‘Seed Journal’ — a space to vision and record ideas, observations and reflections, many of which could become actual projects and designs, if, or when the conditions were optimal for them to germinate and grow. I purchased an A5 Dot Journal to try for the first time. (There are many different brands of these journals available. Purchasing one from a stationary shop local to you if at all possible, rather than from big multinationals, will obviously keep more money in your local community. )
Here is a summary of how I have used, (and sometimes creatively adapted), various Anchor Points from the Design Web as a core part of my Seed Journal Tool.
Project Pages ​- Examples of these in my Seed Journal are :- Design pages, (a space to document information relating to a specific design); Blog post ideas; Lunar & Solar Cycles; Social media planning; Learning notes about a particular topic; Budgeting; Log of useful resources; Mindmap of project ideas for next year.
This Anchor Point for me is a reminder about how important creativity is in my life. And each week I try and engage in some artwork that is just for the sole purpose of taking a break, often I will listen to some relaxing meditation music at the same time, and then I glue the creative piece into my Seed Journal.
I use this Anchor Point to focus on recording daily activities that are important to me, and symptoms of my illness. It’s a really useful way to look at the patterns and connections between them, then making changes for the next month as suggestions and solutions emerge.
I find spending time on indepth visioning for the month ahead, a creative and inspiring way to design beyond the edges of my comfort zone, as well as considering aspects of my life and work that may of had very little attention recently. I use a mix of Mother Peace Tarot Cards, various decks of Oracle cards, Gaia Craft Permaculture Principle Cards and Group Works Cards.
Actually not an Anchor Point in the Design Web, but nearly always part of a permaculture design. I like to use the SMART acronym for goal setting . This link is a great one for expanding on the typical: — Specific; Measurable; Achievable; Measurable; Time bound. The monthly overview in this image above is collaged from the wonderful Earth Pathways Diary
I have a page each month where I can literally write down ideas as they come into my head. Then at the start of each week I consider how they might fit into the days ahead, or possible connections with project pages in my Seed Journal
At the end of each month I spend dedicated time on reflecting how the month has gone, and link to my goals and patterns for the month. I like using Roses, Buds and Thorns reflection tool here, but it’s also a great opportunity to try out some of the others too, for example PMI (Pluses Minuses, Interesting) or SWOC (Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Constraints).
The small spaces in this layout work really well for me. Enough room to document, without too much space to feel overwhelmed about filling it! It takes me about 10 minutes to draw this out each week. It can be a good opportunity for thinking about intentions for the week ahead.
Not officially part of the Design Web, but an additional section I use to capture the general overview of the week, for example, significant moon phases, festivals, celebrations or other important times.
​As part of my ongoing learning and growing as a permaculture practitioner I like to focus on a particular Permaculture Principle each week, and spend time throughout the week reflecting on how this principle can be used in the different areas of my own life, community (online and face to face), and globally. It can be a useful focus for me when I am not well enough to engage in much physical activity, (I have called this my ‘structured daydreaming’ tool, a redefinition of ‘not feeling well enough to do anything’). Sometimes I journal about my thoughts relating to principles, especially if it seems like it would be a good reflection to ‘capture’ for future projects. And on other occasions, I choose a permaculture principle I know is going to be a useful one for specific plans for the week. At other times I use the wonderful Gaia Craft Permaculture Principle Cards to inspire me.
I use this space to document a particular quote, poem, song lyrics or anything else that resonates with me at this time. Reminding myself about it each day really helps to ingrain its meaning and connection for me in my life.
I use these Anchor Points together. This space is for ideas for action throughout the day, plus a log of other actions that occurred without plan, throughout the day.
People I want/need to connect with during that day. And then at the end of the day, additional people who I connected with.
I really like using tarot and oracle cards as part of my daily routine, to inspire and perhaps encourage thinking and reflecting outside of my comfort zone. I briefly record these reflections here.
​I use the Roses Thorns and Buds reflection tool to do a mini-reflection for each day.
Not an Anchor Point in the Design Web — but I find it useful to have a separate section to be clear about which permaculture projects I am focusing on each day/week.
​Space for daily gratitude.
So, this was a brief exploration through, how my new Seed Journal Tool, guided by the a people focused permaculture design process, the Design Web, works incredibly well for me. Implementing this design has been a really useful reminder of how ecological principles and the Permaculture Ethics of People Care, Fairshares and Earth Care, can be used in healing, resilience building and regeneration of ourselves. I’ve been using my Seed Journal, including, overtime, several useful changes, for 9 months now. Its emerged into a really positive core aspect of how I am adapting my life to several major life events, in particular the onset of chronic illness, over the last two years. Rather than a prescriptive ‘how to’, this blog is very much about sharing ideas that may inspire you, and could well be adapted for your own life.";Permaculture Women's Guild

Water is the most essential element to life on earth. Take a moment and really let that sink in. Do your everyday practices demonstrate a reverence for this finite resource? The permaculture design process can help you protect and care for the water in your life and community. It can also ease the irrigation burden in your food-producing systems.
When you’ve managed water well, whether in your home, garden, or community, other elements in the system will come alive. Now that’s powerful.
For many of us, clean water comes directly from a tap in an instant. Because of this, it’s easy to forget how finite this resource is, and how our practices regarding water may be unsustainable.
Upon further inspection, one realizes there is not a single organism on earth that can live without it. Good thing we’re living on the Blue Planet, right?
Well, the truth may shock you. It turns out that only .5% (!) of all water on earth is freshwater, available to us. Much of the rest is locked in ice or deep in the earth’s crust. In other words, our most precious and important resource is amazingly finite.
For this reason, most native peoples have traditionally honored this element’s sacredness. When your life is closely entwined with — and dependent on — access to clean water, you protect it, rejoice, and give thanks for its presence.
Modern civilization on the other hand, has become disconnected to water’s sacredness due in large part to the convenience of modern systems.
Less than 200 years ago, modern indoor plumbing hit the scene. This highly engineered system brings water efficiently to each household. However, it also sends away water that was used only once faster than it came.
When people become intrigued by permaculture design, they usually expect to learn how to apply permaculture principles to a landscape. In truth, when we cultivate a relationship with water, our actions can benefit much more than a single landscape. While our gardens may be more resilient and robust with permaculture design, so, too, can our local watershed and ecology.
Permaculture design allows us to think about our place within the system as a whole. In this article we’ll check out ways to become better stewards of water in all areas of life.
Part of the permaculture design process is looking to see where resources are being lost or wasted.
The average American uses 1200 gallons of water per day. In the U.S. alone, vast underground aquifers that have taken more than 2 million years to develop, are depleting faster than they can be replenished. This is largely because of consumer habits and a lack of reverence for water.
Are you wondering what you can do to better care for this wasted resource in your personal life? From eating organic food to eschewing packaged foods, these 10 tips can help.
In the western world especially, we must find ways to respect and conserve this vital resource, as if our lives depended on it, because they do!
The typical pathway for water in a municipal system is this: Clean water is pumped into the home. It’s used only once before it is whisked away again to the municipal treatment plant for cleaning. This is a very energy intensive cycle to filtrate, pump, and collect waste water that so quickly enters and leaves the home.
An ecological home water cycle, on the other hand, seeks to retain and recycle water onsite whenever possible. For example, greywater — the used water from sinks, showers, and washing machines — can potentially be used in the landscape.
While this might seem unsanitary, in fact, soil organisms are pretty efficient at filtering and sanitizing. Utilizing greywater onsite is quite possibly the next frontier — after recycling and composting — for reducing household waste.
Seeking out ways to utilize greywater helps us to be more mindful of both water use and water cleanliness. When I know water is headed for my garden rather than to the municipal treatment plant, I’m more mindful of what I add to the water.
If you would like to explore ways to take advantage of greywater to connect the inside of your home with your landscape, or other sustainable water topics, check out the wealth of information and ideas at GreywaterAction.org.
Take advantage of these water opportunities so you can conserve water, reduce pollution and the strain on sewer systems, add fertility to the garden, and create a dynamic, living water cycle within the home that is integrated with the landscape.
Let’s look outside and see how you can design a landscape that respects and cares for water.
It is essential to know where a landscape is situated within its local watershed in order to apply permaculture design to the site. A single landscape is just one part of a larger system, and our goal is to support regenerative ecosystems as a whole.
Understanding how water moves throughout a watershed helps you to visualize where water is being wasted in the landscape. Armed with this knowledge, you can find appropriate ways to manage it.
Try this exercise: Look at the water that comes in and out of a landscape. Where does it come from? Is the source clean or polluted? When it leaves a site, where does it go?
When you think about your landscape as part of a whole watershed, you can look for ways to conserve water and maintain water purity.
Observe where water is being lost or wasted in a garden. Armed with this knowledge, you can look for smart ways to make the system more robust and interconnected. Sometimes the solution is as straightforward as building soil, mulching appropriately, or routing a downspout so that it discharges in the garden as passive irrigation.
Other times, the solution is more involved. For example, earthworks are man-made structures that change the topography of the land in order to direct and manage water. On some sites, the goal will be to redirect excess water, while on other sites earthworks encourage infiltration.
The permaculture design process can help you assess a landscape for its particular qualities and find ways to manage water appropriately.
The water that falls or collects on a site is a precious resource. In a permaculture design, the aim is to use water as many times as possible before it passes out of the system and to send only clean water into your local watershed.
Dr. Chika Ezeanya-Esiobu was working as a consultant for the World Bank in Washington, D.C. One day, she overheard her boss complaining about an irrigation project that had cost millions of dollars to build. The solution in the Republic of Niger was falling far short of its intended goals to bring irrigation to crops. Of course, irrigation is essential for agriculture in this region that is 75% parched desert.
Meanwhile, a traditional irrigation method in the region, called tassa, demonstrated glowing results. Plots of land growing millet using the tassa method were 98% more productive than plots of land not using the method. That’s an incredible increase in productivity using a hand-dug technique! Watch Dr. Ezeanya-Esiobu’s TED Talk here.
These results are encouraging, but not surprising. After all, native techniques tend to be low-tech, low-cost, and work with the land to produce a lasting and water-wise solution.
You might find yourself aghast at the wastefulness and over-engineering of the World Bank solution and its disconnect with the local ecology and people. It’s easy to judge that which is removed from our own experience. As such, when we circle back to our own bioregion of the world, we must be vigilant about solutions that are disconnected from the qualities and needs of a landscape or community.
Remember the over-engineered municipal water system that sends filtered water all the way to your home to be used only once before being disposed of as waste? Learn to discover where resources are being lost and seek out specific strategies that match the needs of a site. Why invent the wheel when there may be an appropriate, low-tech solution right under your nose?
Design with water in mind, and you’ll observe a powerful, integrated system (whether in your home, garden, or community) come to life.

"Even though we were already applying several permaculture principles on our homestead, going through the GOBRADIME design process was a fantastic way to identify the remaining gaps and opportunities we had in our system. It also resulted in a succinct planning tool that I can now use to evaluate the effectiveness of my design decisions, and to track our progress during implementation. Best of all, it provides my family with a finished product we can use to share the story and purpose behind our homestead with others, along with a never-ending list of discussion topics to write about on our homestead blog and other forums.

The soil at my new place is marginal but well drained and it hasn’t been gardened in a few years, so the weeds are pretty intense. A season’s worth of root vegetables will condition the garden for spring planting.
It’s a formula I’ve used many times: Dig up the lawn and plant potatoes, beets, turnips — anything that is big, fast growing and can compete with grass. Then mulch them up real good when they’re half-grown and when you dig them up to harvest, voila! The result is fluffy, rich soil.
A Rainbow of Roots, a Selection of Root Vegetables to Plant
Will all of these grow in your garden? Maybe. But one of the beautiful things about root vegetables is that they can be grown in any large container. Even if you don’t have the ideal microclimate in your yard, you might be able to create the right conditions on a patio, in a greenhouse or on a windowsill in the kitchen. As such, I have included some veggies here that aren’t as common in the U.S. as they are in South and Central America but, with a little trial and error, I think we can get a good crop in a temperate climate.
Plant root vegetables now, it’s the perfect time. And in most cases, plant them again in the spring. And again in the summer.
Beets: Direct sow, then, when they’re about 2 inches high, take the time to carefully thin the clusters of baby beets to 6 or 8 inches apart. They’ll get yuge!
Burdock: Bumblebees love it! Harvest first-year roots from plants that haven’t sent up a flower stalk yet. Use for tea or peel, chop and fry in oil. Tasty!
Canna: Not commonly eaten in the states but in South America that fabulous red-flowered canna is food. So easy to grow, so completely gorgeous. Look specifically for Canna edulis, since the other species aren’t edible.
Carrots: Carrots come in a full spectrum of colors and, like all foods, the nutritional value varies with the color. For example, purple carrots are high in anthocyanin, an amino acid that helps the body process food and combat disease.
Celeriac: I can’t stand celery. I don’t grow it and I don’t eat it. But celeriac? I love it! Some would say the flavor is the same but I just love that crunchy-creamy texture of baked celeriac. And the knobby, odd-looking plants are a great conversation piece in the garden.
Garlic: Always plant garlic. (See my earlier article “Growing Gorgeous Garlic,” Sept. 17, 2015.)
Ginger: I got some really nice ginger from the store. It was on my windowsill for a couple of weeks and it started to sprout. So I planted it in big pots on the patio and now I have huge flowering plants. So easy.
Jicama: Did you know jicama is a bean? Well, technically it’s the root of a bean. The Lima-like pods are also edible but the good stuff is under the soil in that juicy, sweet and crunchy root. Try it sliced into fingers and dipped in hot sauce.
Oca: Oca has been a staple of Andean diets for centuries. Some years ago, farmers on the West Coast of the U.S. discovered that oca grows well around there and in more colors than you can fit in one hand. And they’re spicy! Flavors vary as much as the colors do.
Onions: I pick up bags of onion sets when they’re on sale at the nursery and plant them compulsively on corners and borders.
Parsnips: Some people love ’em, some people hate ’em, but everyone should wear gloves and long sleeves when harvesting because fresh parsnips can cause a terrible, blistering skin rash.
Potatoes: Potatoes come in every color you can imagine. My favorites are the yellow fingerlings that taste like butter when they’re new.
Radishes: Radishes are easy, fast and so much fun to grow. Top of the list for children’s gardens.
Rutabaga: Native to Sweden, this root is similar to a turnip but bigger, more gnarly and hardy through ridiculously cold temperatures.
Salsify: The root tastes like oysters. The flowers are huge, purple and fantastic. Need I say more?
Sunchokes: Once you’ve established a patch of sunchokes, (aka Jerusalem artichokes) you’ll always have plenty on hand because they sprout readily from the smallest portion of a tuber left in the ground. They are reasonably drought tolerant and make 10-foot-high flowers that look like sunflowers. In fact, they’re closely related, but this species makes edible tubers.
Sweet Potatoes: Did you know they’re in the morning glory family? The flowers are beautiful and sweet potatoes might be easier to grow than you realize. Look for “slips,” tiny rooted plantlets that you can order in the late spring.
Tapioca/Yuca/Taro/Cassava: Yep, they are all the same thing! I had no idea until doing research for this article. I’ve eaten this plant in so many different ways, by so many names, in so many different countries that I assumed they were all different. Manihot esculenta is one of the most diverse food plants on the planet. It grows easily in most West Coast microclimates but learn to prepare it correctly because improperly processed roots are poisonous.
Turmeric: All the rage with super-food enthusiasts everywhere, turmeric is actually pretty easy to grow as a houseplant in our climate.
Turnips: Not a fan? I wasn’t either until I grew my own. Harvest them young for a milder flavor. Grate them and make vegetable fritters. Mmhmm!
Ulloco: Obscure but easy to grow, this Andean tuber tastes a lot like jicama. Ulloco is related to Malabar spinach, if that means anything to you.
Yacon: If you haven’t tried this looks-like-a-yam-but-tastes-like-grape-cider crunchy purple root from the Andes that has recently gained major popularity in American markets, you’re missing out. Yacon is nutritious, delicious and fairly easy to grow as long as the gophers don’t get to those yummy tubers before you do.
Yams: Not the same as sweet potatoes and not so easy to grow. Yams are actually more closely related to lilies and grass than sweet potatoes and aren’t easily grown anywhere on the West Coast.
Pro Tips
Mulch: Most root vegetables like a moist, thick mulch at least twice during the growing season.
Harvest: It’s fun to dig up a fresh crop of tasty tubers! But resist the urge to toss them around. Bruises become rotten spots in storage and you’ll get a much longer shelf life with undamaged produce.
Storage: Cut off all leaves and gently clean roots with a damp towel and store in a cool, dark, dry place on cardboard (not plastic) trays. Try to place them so that they don’t touch each other. If you stack them, put a paper bag or sheet of cardboard between layers, staying mindful of air circulation. Follow these basic steps and you can store potatoes, yams, garlic and most other roots for several months without refrigeration.";Permaculture Women's Guild

It is one of the oldest cultivated crops, and all around the world people still rank garlic among their favorite foods. And it’s not just food — it’s medicine, too. Garlic is used as an antibiotic, antiviral, heavy metal detox, and to fight colds, high blood pressure, Alzheimers, diabetes and cancer. It even wards off vampires and evil spirits, or so they say.
Start with quality seed garlic
Sure, you can plant that nice organic garlic you got at the Co-op or the farmers market. It was delicious, right? And it will probably grow just fine. But keep in mind that plants that were grown specifically for the purpose of being seed stock have been monitored for traits such as disease resistance, drought tolerance and uniformity, among many other things. And, by purchasing seed stock from a reputable grower, you are connecting to a lineage that is building long-term food security.
As for varieties, you will never run out of options, but here are some reliable ones to start with.
Softneck varieties, with a milder flavor, good for braiding and long-term storage:
Nootka Rose, for proven reliability in temperate climates, available from Garlicana in Southern Oregon. Check out their free PDF Catalog for an education on the history and genetics of garlic. www.garlicana.com
Transylvanian (because who could resist?) from Great Northern Garlic in central Washington State. www.greatnortherngarlic.com.
Chinese Pink, because it matures extra early. From Territorial Seed Company in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. www.territorialseed.com.
Stiffneck varieties, with a stronger flavor and edible scapes, great for roasting and pickling:
Turkish Giant, famous for giant, easy to peel cloves, also from Territorial (above).
Music, bred for large size, strong flavor and disease resistance. Available through High Mowing Seeds. Their online catalog features a cool comparison feature that lists several types of garlic. www.highmowingseeds.com.
Chesnok, a red Siberian variety known for hardiness and flavor, also from High Mowing.
Where to plant garlic
Garlic likes full sun, but it will still do OK in a spot that gets some shade. Garlic and roses are classic garden companions, and it stands to reason that garlic will also do well among other members of the rose family.
Try planting patches of garlic around your plums, peaches, apples, raspberries, blackberries and cherries. Or just clear a sunny area in your garden that you don’t mind devoting to garlic until next June (or so).
How to plant garlic
Use a small longneck bottle to make the holes in your freshly weeded and raked garden bed. A small hot-sauce bottle from a brand like Cholula works great for making the holes the perfect depth. Make each hole 6 inches apart, in a pattern that makes the best use of the space in your bed.
Now, break up the heads of your seed garlic and pull the outer papers off of each clove. Plant each clove individually, with the flat side down, pointy side up. Fill the holes with rich, organic compost.
Make sure to mulch!
Garlic is drought-resistant, to a point. A thick mulch can make a huge difference in whether your plants die of thirst or not. When you’ve just planted the cloves and filled the holes with compost, spread a thin layer of manure over the beds. Top that with 2 inches of straw mulch and saturate the whole area with water. Add another inch of straw and forget about it for the winter. If there is a very dry Autumn, water the patch a couple of times. But it will probably be just fine on its own as long as we get some rain by January.
Weed, fertilize, and mulch again.
Garlic is a “heavy feeder” and will do much better without a lot of competition. In the early spring, the stringy green tops of your garlic crop will be pushing out of the straw mulch, and so will a bunch of random weeds. Go through, pull out the weeds, and remove that overwintered straw mulch as you go. Now use a small rake to scratch in some organic fertilizer (anything that’s recommended for roses will work just fine).
Toss the old mulch on your compost pile and spread a fresh layer on your garlic patch. This helps prevent mold and mildew from gaining ground while your bulbs mature. Water well after this weeding-fertilizing-mulching adventure and then you don’t need to do much else until it’s time to harvest.
Eat the garlic scapes!
​If you planted stiffneck varieties, you’re in for a treat. The flower stalks, called “garlic scapes,” are delicious when pan-fried or flame-grilled. The stalks will shoot straight up, crowned by a point head-bud, which will plump out and then curl around the stalk in a spiral pattern. Snap that off and fry it up! Removing the scapes also helps the heads grow bigger.
If you want to try and save the seedlets from the later-mature flower stalk, don’t cut the scape. Wait until the hard little seedlets are completely dry, and then harvest and replant them. Either way, once scapes have curled, it’s time to cut off any irrigation and let the garlic dry down a bit before harvesting.
Harvest
With softneck garlic, it is best to remove the straw mulch a couple of weeks before harvest, to help avoid mold. Plants that have mold on them will not store well, and they will infect the storage area with mold spores. If you spot moldy patches early, you can remove them with a clean knife. Keep the patch weeded and don’t overwater. When the heads seem to be starting to beef up (and the tops seem to be dying back a little) then rake all of the mulch off the area and cut the water.
It’s time to harvest when all of the tops are at least 60 percent brown. The night before, give the whole patch a good watering to soften up the ground for digging. Harvest gently, with a D-handled digging fork, working slowly and attentively to avoid slicing into the heads. Don’t yank on the tops and don’t cut them off. Garlic is delicate when first harvested! And don’t dig up the whole patch at once. Dig up a few heads and see if they are mature. Have the bulbs rounded out, or are they still elongated? There is no sense it waiting nine months for your crop and then harvesting it a week too early. Be patient!
Curing and storage
​After harvesting, your bulbs need to cure for optimum flavor and storability. Leave the tops on and either braid them together or gather them into bunches for curing. Hang in a cool, dark, dry space for at least a month. This will cause the bulbs to harden and tighten. Now you can hang up the braids in the kitchen, and/or cut off the tops and store the heads, sell them, eat them, pickle them or give them to the neighborhood kids for Halloween!

Getting your plants started may seem, at first, a daunting process. But once you’ve taken that crucial, first step towards growing your own food, the best is yet to come.
You may have gotten your necessary materials together; pot, a packet of seeds, and soil.
You open your packet of seeds, bury some seeds in the soil, and water.
Then you wait,
and wait.
I find this stage of gardening to be the most frustrating and yet the one most rewarding for the patient gardener.
Sometimes you wait weeks, and nothing appears.
Sometimes many seedlings poke their way out of the soil.
However, when you’re starting this whole process can seem like alchemy.
If you are starting the seeds with the intent to transfer them outside, the process becomes even more confusing!
I’ve had whole flats of thriving seedlings I’ve transplanted outside die within two days of transplanting.
“Since I started implementing Biointensive techniques to start our seedlings, the stress of getting seeds into the garden has largely gone away.”
I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one who’s suffered learning how to grow plants from seed.
I had limited success until I was directed to research “biointensive” growing (different than “biodynamic”), pioneered by John Jevons, founder of Ecology Action. His particular method in its entirety is called GROW BIOINTENSIVE and spelled out in that all-caps style means that all eight elements of the technique are being followed.
The GROW BIOINTENSIVE method, although having some overlap with Permaculture principles, really stands out for its detailed research on starting seeds in flats and transplanting them efficiently into raised beds for maximum productivity.
When asked about the effectiveness of the GROW BIOINTENSIVE method which is known to produce 2–6 times the yield with a fraction of the resources usually used to do the same, John Jeavons is the first to say,
“You are the solution, GROW BIOINTENSIVE isn’t. Grow Biointensive is a tool. It’s our choice what we do. If you don’t do GROW BIOINTENSIVE sustainably,
with all of its aspects,
you’re going to kill people with it.”
In this article, we are only focusing on biointensive seed starting: one of many practices of Jeavons teaches in his book, “How to Grow More Vegetables.”
The main takeaways I got from John’s book, “How to Grow More Vegetables,” is that the most effective way to start seedlings is in flats.
Long, rectangular shallow trays such as the one shown below are best. They are often called 10/20 trays because of their size in inches.
Notice that they do not have any holes for drainage because at the beginning stages of a seed’s life, you want a lot of water to burst open the seed that you are trying to germinate.
For those who would like to use a non-plastic alternative, there are instructions at the back of the book for building your own seed flats from wood.
“It is quite normal to plant 180–300 seeds in one flat.”
In Biointensive growing, you spend time to make sure the seeds are spaced evenly with minimal spacing.
It’s quite normal to plant 180–300 seeds in one flat.
The idea is to mimic nature, where seeds don’t naturally land in long spaced out rows.
Seedlings don’t need a lot of space for root or leaf development, so most of the directions on seed packets are overly conservative and don’t affect the growth of the seeds (just the number of plants you can grow in one flat).
Another tip I’ve found immensely helpful that I’ve picked up from the book is to plant the seeds as deep as their size.
Most of us bury our seeds much too deeply; many seeds require light for germination so if they are buried too deep they’ll never end up germinating.
I start my seeds all-year-round.
Some people in temperate climates are surprised by the fact that they can grow outside of the warm seasons.
If you would like salads and would like to harvest lettuce year-round, you can start your seeds every 2–3 weeks the first year. In the second year, you will find that as long as you harvest only the tops of the lettuce and leave the base for it to regrow, you can so at much less frequency.
Of course, you should not start “cool weather crops” right before the summer. But you can start certain “cool weather crops” at the very end of summer right before the fall when the weather starts getting cool again. More on seasons “cool weather” and “warm weather” crops on the blog, “Planning your Planting Calendar”
After your seeds have:
you would then transplant them into your garden a way that maximizes space.
To illustrate this principle, have you ever planted a tray of seeds according to the seed packet directions and are leftover with half a packet or more?
Or have you planted seeds that were small, broadcasted the seed around the tray, and ended up with patches of intense growth that you have to separate (usually unsuccessfully) in order to transplant?
This philosophy of maximizing space carries over into the garden when you transplant the seedlings outside.
Instead of transplanting in rows, biointensive recommendations are to plant using hexagonal spacing where the plants are close enough that their leaves will touch when they are at full size.
In addition to allowing you to grow the most plants in the same space, the foliage as it develops will start to cover the bare exposed soil and greatly reduce the effects of evaporation.
Since I started implementing biointensive techniques to start our seedlings, the stress of getting seeds into the garden has largely gone away.
I still have difficulties starting certain perennial plants from seed but for most vegetables, flowers, and herbs it’s a simple repeatable process that helps me to focus more on seasonal timings and harvests.
There are a few additional tips on transplanting I’d like to point out:
If you are planting leafy greens, it takes quite a few plants to produce a decent harvest and the roots are quite long and delicate.
Transplanting a flat of 180 plants can easily take over an hour with a dibber (pictured above). A dibber is anything used to poke neat holes into which you would plop your transplant.
However, I’ve discovered that using a straight-edge shovel plunged vertically into the plant line and then wedged over yields a big enough gap to quickly dangle in a half dozen seedling roots.
I then remove the shovel and let the soil spring back without too much disturbance and pin the roots naturally with a little bit of patting to remove the shovel line.
With this technique, I can easily transplant a flat in about 30 minutes, which helps when you have a 2-year old son who loves to come along behind you and yank out the seedlings I just planted.

Now that you’ve learned the five steps to growing your plant from seed, your challenge is to get offline, find a tray of soil, and start sowing.";Permaculture Women's Guild
"Lying in a field on a sunny Saturday, listening to the bees buzz as my friend and partner attended to the hives.
Purple heads sprang up from the earth all around me, and I tried to ask my friend via WhatsApp if this was the protected mountain tea that her friend picks from his cow fields.
I had no storage space on my phone to download a plant ID app, so as there was no reply, I popped one of the heads in my pocket and continued to amble around the fields and surrounding forest.
Later, when I got home, my friend had replied to say that no, it wasn’t the protected mountain tea, but it was something called prunella vulgaris.
I looked it up and found that its other names such as heal-all come from the fact that, as a medicinal plant, it really does help everything.
‘Heal All has been used as an alternative medicine for centuries on just about every continent in the world, and for just about every ailment known to man’
Damn. What a shame I’d left it behind.
‘Prunella is taken internally as a herbal tea in the treatment of fevers, diarrhea, sore mouth and throat, internal bleeding, and weaknesses of the liver and heart. It is showing promise in research for herpes, cancer, AIDS, diabetes, and many other maladies.’
My friend’s field was a good hour’s walk uphill and it felt ridiculous to go back there after spending so long there before, plus it was already late.
But I still wanted the flowers.
I’d read that it tasted like black tea and thought it could be perfect for a locally sourced caffeine free version (heal-all chai anyone?)
So, I got in my car and drove back up the mountain, armed with my finest wicker foraging basket.
I filled the basket with heads, feeling so glad to have come back to the spot that faces a range of mountains, watching the sun cast shadows over the peaks.
It felt good to spend a Saturday collecting flowers for tea, and learning about a medicinal herb new to me.
Has anyone else had experiences with this herb? Or know any other unusual plant medicines that can be found in the rolling hills of the European countryside?";Permaculture Women's Guild
"I grow easily and abundantly, though people only tend to notice me when I’m large and leafy.
Or when I sting.
It’s not that I don’t like people, it’s just that I must protect myself from being taken away.
I’ve been taken away so many times, you see, it pains me.
And if it’s not me, it’s my friends.
Sometimes I get lucky, hiding as a little seedling in the path whilst I watch my aunty being cut or ripped from the ground.
But it’ll only take a few weeks before I’ve grown to her height, towering over the path with my hairy stem, tiny little bristles thicken my trunk, whilst my delicate leaves splay out to reach for light.
I like it when I’m able to reproduce, it’s so exciting to feel the baby seeds forming, shooting off from my stalk.
The best is when they get to pop off and scatter all over the ground.
That’s why, in truth, it doesn’t really matter if I get harvested.
There’s always plenty more of me to go around.
And I don’t mind when I’m put to good use — composting with other plants, bulking out a soup, seeping my nutrients into a hot tea.
I’m very medicinal, but not everyone realises.
They feel the sting and they turn away, they think of me as an enemy to be destroyed.
Even though my friend the doc leaf always lives close by for those who need it.
And actually, if you squeeze me tight, just pinching my stem with two fingers, I can be touched and held with bare hands.
I’m great for the soil, I’m nitrogen-fixing, I’m drinkable, edible and wonderful in a tincture for soothing insect bites.
But I do like being left to my own devices.
My favourite home is in the forest, where I can grow and reach out my leaves as far as they can go.
Where I can stand peacefully with the dewdrops landing quietly on my outstretched arms.
Where I can calmly breathe out my fresh, leafy green smell to mix with the woody flavours of the forest.
Where no one will rip my roots out, cut off my top, or scream about my sting.";
" Growing food at home is hardly a new idea. But in this culture, where more people know how to take the perfect selfie than how to grow a potato, urban agriculture has become a form of activism. The slogan “Food Not Lawns” is spreading like wildfire.
These are just some of the ideas that sparked the Food Not Lawns movement. I started the original Food Not Lawns organization in 1999 in Eugene, Oregon. Three of us who cooked for the local Food Not Bombs chapter started calling ourselves Food Not Lawns and hosting workshops in our garden. Our vision was to share seeds and plants with our neighborhood, to promote local awareness about food security and to learn about permaculture, sustainability and organic gardening.
Within two years the project had expanded to include dozens of gardens around the neighborhood, and Food Not Lawns was rewarded with a Neighborhood Development Grant from the city of Eugene. From there, Food Not Lawns continued to blossom. Now, 20 years later, Food Not Lawns is an International network with more than 50 local chapters and has spawned countless associated projects around the world.
Here are some of the most frequently asked questions that I get from people who want to turn their lawns into gardens:
There are a few options, each with pros and cons:
Sheet mulching.
Sheet mulching is a technique where you cover the grass with cardboard and then pile on organic matter — straw, leaves, food scraps, soil. It’s basically like building a wide, short compost pile all over the yard. The top layer is covered with fine mulch and then nursery plants and seeds can be planted directly into the mulch. This is the preferred method of most permaculture aficionados, as it is the least harmful to soil communities and can be a quick way to build up garden soil for growing food. However, sheet mulching can pose multiple problems.
If you have the kind of grass that spreads through underground rhizomes, there is a good chance those roots won’t die under the mulch, and will eventually create a hard-pack of thick roots that your plants won’t be able to penetrate. Also, the piles of un-composted materials can tie up nutrients and make it hard for your veggies to thrive.
Garden boxes, aka raised beds.
This can be a great way to build gardens quickly, while still maintaining paths and patches of your lawn. Spread a layer of landscape cloth or cardboard on the ground to suppress the grass, and then build boxes in any shape on top. Fill with organic garden soil and you’re ready to plant. This is a great technique for people who have back problems and prefer to garden in beds that are up off the ground. Problems with garden boxes include the continued growth of grass rhizomes, as I mentioned above with sheet mulching. Also, the soil in the boxes gets stale over time and will need to be replaced and/or amended. Garden boxes also tend to decay and fall apart over time, and will need to be repaired.
​Lawns use more equipment, labor, fuel, and agricultural toxins than industrial farming, making lawns the largest (and most toxic) agricultural sector in the United States, so grow food, not lawns.​
By far the most effective way for permanently removing your lawn is to dig off the top layer of grass and then till up the soil underneath. This presents a blank slate for designing your garden layout, and new plants will be able to send deep roots into the ground. Tilling can be problematic, however, if you have lots of rocks or toxic soil. Tilling also disrupts micro-communities in the soil, so it’s important to mulch over the new beds with good organic matter. Once you’ve tilled and established a garden, you probably won’t need to till again as long as you maintain the garden and keep the remnants of grass roots from re-establishing themselves.
Of course not! In my opinion, the transformation of any lawn to a garden is always a good thing. However, growing food in the front yard becomes a statement to your community, telling them that you value homegrown food. Front yard gardens invite community dialogue, and bring fellow gardeners in the neighborhood out of the woodwork. Front yard gardens can also provoke complaints from the neighbors, however, so follow these four basic guidelines to help ensure those neighborly reactions are positive:
1. Be creative. Spend some time designing a garden that is beautiful and unique. Get some books on edible ornamentals and create a landscape people will see as a work of art.
2. Be consistent. Don’t let the front yard get overgrown and unsightly. Keep up with weeding, mulching and pruning. Be ruthless with dead and diseased plants. If your energy for gardening wanes, scale back your plans and only grow what you can maintain.
3. Be charitable. Offer surplus produce, plants and seeds to your neighbors. Invite them to share in the harvest and offer to help them with their garden ideas. Neighbors who value you as a friend are much less likely to cause problems.
4. Be considerate. Understand that not everyone in your neighborhood will be as excited about growing food as you are. Don’t leave piles of soil or cardboard in the driveway for weeks on end. Consider their needs and they will consider yours.
Not at all. In fact I recommend starting small. Remove a section of the lawn and plant a little bit of food or a herb spiral. Or remove the lawn around the edges and plant an edible hedge of raspberries and currants. Or just carve out a few circular spots and plant some peaches and figs. These small changes will provide a delicious inspiration for you and your neighbors, and when the time is right to take out the rest of the lawn, you’ll be ready!";Permaculture Women's Guild
"Growing a garden is one of the best ways to get exercise, spend time outdoors and improve your diet and sense of food security, but sometimes it can be difficult to find the motivation.
To get back into the swing of things, I like to start with what I call the Three P’s of Spring: peas, poppies and potatoes.
Gardeners always tell me that their homegrown peas never make it out of the garden because the gardener eats them first, and I say, “That’s just fine.” Fresh peas are a wonderful way to lure yourself into the field, and once you’ve filled your belly, you might as well do some work! Peas come in many forms: snap peas and snow peas have an edible pod and are delicious raw or in a stir-fry. Shelling peas yield larger peas inside an inedible pod, so you have to peel them, but the flavor is well worth the work. Bush peas don’t need a trellis and can be planted anywhere in the garden. Trailing varieties need a trellis, so plant them against a fence or around a cage.
For bush peas, I like Oregon Giant and Sugar Ann. Sugar Snap is a good choice for a trailing snap pea, but my favorite pea of all time is Alderman, a shelling variety with a rich, buttery flavor. Sow seeds directly into well-prepared soil. To boost germination, add a bacterial inoculant (available at most garden stores), or pre-sprout them in a jar with a bit of water for a few days ahead of time. Sow the seeds 2 inches deep and cover. Be sure to protect them from slugs and snails. My favorite way to do this is by sprinkling a tiny ring of black pepper around each seedling.
There are many different kinds of annual and perennial poppies that will do well in almost any climate, but my favorite are the Papaver somniferum, also known as bread-seed poppies or opium poppies. It’s perfectly legal to grow the flowers and the seeds are edible and rich in nutrients. Scoring the pods for their opiate properties is, however, highly illegal. I’ve always grown them for the stunning flowers, which come in a vast array of pinks, purples, reds and whites. Varieties of bread-seed poppies can be found with single flowers (just a few large petals), doubles (dozens of smaller petals) and hens-and-chicks, which have a bunch of tiny flowers around a large flower in the middle. Plant three or four of the tiny seeds into small hills placed at least 3 feet apart, then thin the sprouts down to one plant per hill. Poppies are extremely heavy feeders and need a lot of space to grow. If you plant them too close together, they will bloom when very tiny and you will miss out on the true glory of a 4-foot tall poppy plant, boasting dozens of giant flowers. To fill all that space between your poppy hills, plant light feeders, such as lettuce, radishes or bush peas.";Permaculture Women's Guild
"I hate starting seeds. Hate it. I direct sow just about everything, including plants that everyone swears must be started early in order to obtain a yield. Here in zone 5, that’s a lot of plants. Even with my late planting, last year I had so many tomatoes I couldn’t pick them all before the first frosts of fall, and given the number that rotted in place, that patch of soil will be producing tomatoes until the end of time.
The only problem with my lazy approach to annuals is that my plants do tend to bear fruit later than those that got an early start. Given my present desire to transition to growing 75%+ of our food (we’re vegan so it’s all fruit and veg around here) I need to take a more disciplined approach to having our plants producing year round.
Enter the indoor tomato. Not a new concept, you’ll find plenty of examples if you search, but I hope to make a decent study of my efforts and results and to even do some starts this spring (gasp!) so I have a control group grown by the more common method. Then next fall, I’ll move tomatoes indoors by rooted cuttings and see if I can obtain a decent crop for the efforts, and keep them alive so that I can take new cuttings the next spring and use those for outdoor growing. If all goes to plan, I won’t have to plant tomato seeds ever again, unless I want new varieties.
There are two categories of tomatoes, determinate and indeterminate. The determinate have a defined growing life and are not good candidates for my intentions. Indeterminate, which will simply grow and grow (and make a mess of tangled tomatoes if you’re not careful — not that I’d know) are a better option. I’ll also be focused on smaller tomatoes, not just cherry and grape sized, but also some on the smaller size among the slicers.
In addition to size, I’m selecting varieties that have a shorter growing season, with the hope that my cuttings will provide tomatoes a bit faster.
The contenders are as follows, chosen based on the above criteria and because they’ve grown well for me in the past.Organic Cherry Tomato, Matt’s Wild CherrySince 1976 we’ve supplied organic gardeners & farmers with Organic Fertilizers and Supplies at very competitive prices.www.groworganic.com

Organic Tomato, Green ZebraSince 1976 we’ve supplied organic gardeners & farmers with Organic Fertilizers and Supplies at very competitive prices.www.groworganic.com
Indeterminate. Green Zebra’s small, round yellow-green fruits have dark-green vertical stripes and emerald flesh. Vines produce up to 2–1/2″ fruits which are tangy and well balanced. Days To Maturity: 60 Days.
I plan to take fall cuttings in three successions, on or about August 1, September 1 and October 1, if the frost holds. The October cutting will be moved up in the case of a projected frost date, even if I cover my outdoor tomatoes.
August is really still summer up here, but as I want my indoor plants to start producing as the outdoor ones are finished off by the fall frosts, I plan to start early. The August cuttings will also be my trial cuttings, so that I can work out any kinks in the growing plan.
Tomatoes are fairly low maintenance, but have some basic requirements to meet.
Overall, it’s starting to sound like an awful lot of effort for a fruit that I happen to dislike. Yes, I admit it, I pick the tomatoes off of things. The rest of my household, including the toddler, think they’re the greatest thing since sliced bread. Getting food into a toddler is plenty enough reason to go to some effort. After a summer of fresh, beautiful tomatoes fresh from the vine, including the few weeks of slow-ripening green tomatoes I snatched in before the frost, she’s a bit of a tomato snob. The first grocery store tomatoes after the stock had run out had her eyeing me suspiciously like I played a trick on her with some foreign object that just looked like a cherry tomato.
In terms of food resiliency and reclaiming the perennial nature of tomatoes, this is not but a first small step. With the climate news growing more anxiety-inducing by the day, among the myriad of other forces working against us, it’s time we take these small steps in toward our self-reliance.
Hopefully at this time next year I’ll have a good report of my efforts to share. In the mean-time, I’d love to hear about any successes or failures in growing tomatoes indoors.

"The following article was originally published in Permaculture Design Magazine’s Issue #102 Plants & Propagation. November 2016.
There is nothing more life-affirming than witnessing a seed sprouting in the garden that you didn’t plant. An old gardener friend once told me, “Life wants to live, ” and I believe that cultivating self-seeding in the garden is one of the best practices in trusting Nature’s ability to self-organize and thrive. Allowing and encouraging plants to self-seed is a practice of resilience for the permaculture garden farm, and offers many benefits in addition to many avenues to explore. Below, we will look at why cultivating self-seeding is a form of resilience, how to encourage it happening in the garden, and some edible and medicinal self-seeding plants with which to consider making an acquaintance.
WHY SELF-SEEDING
There are so many reasons to cultivate self-seeding varieties of flowers, herbs and vegetables in the garden. In addition to getting to know the nature of the plant in its fullest expression, you can save tremendous amount of time by working with nature, as opposed to against it. Perhaps I am a lazy gardener, but this is one of my top reasons for cultivating self-seeding varieties. I also enjoy the surprise, and play of chance; as what emerges is a dynamic process outside of my control. Planning and maintenance are interlinked, and a cultivator of self-seeding varieties works with a design of the garden that is more free form allowing for plants to move around the garden at their own volition, as opposed to expecting plants to stay where we put them. As authors Jonas Reif, Christian Kress, and Hank Gerritsen write in their book Cultivating Chaos: How to Enrich Landscapes with Self-Seeding Plants1, “seeding is a vital way in which plant communities thrive and survive … a way of the garden becoming an ecological system.”
Many people refer to self-seeded plants as “volunteers,” and that is because the self-seeding plants emerged because they have something to offer and the conditions were right for them to offer it. Take the self-seeding dandelion. Dandelions growing in a vacant lot with hard, compacted soil demonstrate one of the highest benefits of “volunteers,” because they can provide a direct ecological function and service. The strong taproots of dandelions work hard to break up the compacted soil, draw water and minerals from soil sublayers, and work to restore and regenerate the land upon which it is growing. Self-seeding dandelions also provide a hardy and nutritious, quick-turn-around pollen source for pollinators in an area of land where many other plant ecologies have not yet been established. In this way, I see self-seeding “volunteers” as offering to us some form of restoration, and renewal at a higher level of knowing than we might see at initial face value.
Self-seeding “volunteer” plants typically beat me out to the garden to plant seeds in the ground. In this way, “volunteers” save garden-farmers time by initiating the growing cycle when the conditions are right, as opposed to having to wait till the garden-farmer can get around to planting them. The self-seeding seed has an intelligence that waits for just the right conditions- just the right soil temperature, moisture, nutrients, and get the growing started. It never ceases to amaze me how borage is already a few inches high before I set out sowing in the Spring!
Self-seeding varieties that have early germination periods, and therefore an early on-set of flowering, can be a crucial pollen and nectar source for beneficial insects. The benefit of food and habitat for pollinators and birds continues throughout the life cycle, as many seeds left on the plants become forage for garden friends. Food and habitat for beneficial insects is a primary way in which self-seeding plants transform the garden-farm into an ecological system, and works with nature so that the garden-farm can create resilient ecological relationships.
Cultivating self-seeding is in direct opposition to the segregated model of agriculture which imports its seed, sows it when the farmer is ready rather than when the seed is ready to grow, harvests the plant for its crop, and then clears the field before the plant can set seed, and repeats. In permaculture, a key principle is “integrate, not segregate” and cultivating self-seeding into the garden integrates the sowing, harvesting, designing and planning, as opposed to segregating those acts into isolated moments of human intervention.
Which brings me to a primary benefit of self-seeding varieties, and that is seeds! As seeds develop on a plant, they are adapting to the specific microclimate of your garden, and will produce more resilient off-spring for the next year. Barbara Pleasant in her article “Self-Seeding Crops You’ll Never Need to Replant”3 says “one of the characteristics of a truly sustainable garden is that it produces at least some of its own seed.” By cultivating self-seeding in the garden, you are allowing for your plants to produce more resilient future generations, as well as, producing more seeds in general. When I allow my greens to go to seed after I have harvested them, I end up with exponentially more green seeds, and in turn more potential plants than I started with. Not only can the garden-farmer use these seeds in the garden, but also the wildlife, as mentioned above. While some farmers may view letting plants going to seed to be a waste, the permaculture garden-farmer sees the myriad of benefits to letting a plant live out its full life cycle, encouraging niches to the overall benefit of the ecosystem.
Finally, the cultivated chaos of self-seeding is extremely beautiful and life-affirming. While the garden-farmer plays a role in creating the garden plan, as a self-seeding cultivator, the interaction is primarily centered on observing Nature’s beautiful design layout, without constant intervention, and making choices to encourage what you find beautiful with the goal of encouraging more beauty. Could that be more life-affirming?
HOW SELF-SEEDING WORKS
The practice of cultivating self-seeding in the garden begins with observing a plant’s full life cycle of birth, death, and decay as it transitions from seed to germination to leaves to fruit to seed to dropping its seed, to wilting, and the forthcoming birth of the next generation. This observation process is a constant reminder, and a vital way to tune into the cycles of Nature.
The more you become aware of the plant’s life cycle, you also start to notice its habit and shape. Does it send out runners, form a mat, sprawl, clump or climb? It is possible to do some background research2. into the habit and form of the self-seeders of interest, but what is most informative is the hyper-localized observation process of watching the growing patterns of self-seeding plants on the land where you are. Whatever you learn about growing you are learning about growing where you are. This is true because of microclimates, and the fact that each piece of land has slightly different soil, wind, water, and sun exposure. So what might thrive in one place, doesn’t in another, and visa versa. The best bet of someone who wants to cultivate self-seeding in the garden is to dive right into it. One encouraging thing about the practice- there’s no such thing as failing! Whatever grows grows, and lessons can be learned!
There are different elements in self-seeding plant communities of which are worth paying attention that will support the cultivation of a desired design outcome. For example, what is the population density of the “volunteers” like: is it thick, sparse, or sporadic? How quickly after germinating do they set seed (note: many varieties will set seed quicker when the temperature rises, or they are grown in very close proximity to other seeds)? What is the dispersal pattern of the seeds (do the seeds drop straight to the ground, are they moved by animals or the wind?)?
Having a sense of how specific self-seeding plants grow in your garden allows you to make more informed decisions when intervening. Intervention in the self-seeding garden-farm including select weeding and thinning plants you don’t want to make more space for those you do, and supporting the spreading of plant communities either by dropping the seeds yourself in weeded soil. If you are cultivating self-seeding flowers versus self-seeding greens, you may have different approaches. For example, with self-seeding greens I may start by seeding them heavy like a carpet in a bed in the Spring. After harvesting baby greens for a few yields I will allow them to go to seed (The stress from space competition increases the speed at which most greens will go to seed.). By end of summer, I will have another round of greens sprouting up with little to no work. On the other hand, if I was cultivating self-seeding flowers like calendula or borage, I may thin or transplant “volunteers” to their suggested growing space to allow each plant to reach their maximum growing expression. It is really up to the garden-farmer as to what is your highest priority: is it leaves, greens, seed, color, or something else. With those design goals in mind, intervention is simply a curated process.
It is important to understand that there are self-seeding annuals, self-seeding biennials, and self-seeding perennials. What this means is that how long the individual plant lives depends on its life cycle. For example, a self-seeding annual will grow its full life out, flower and set-seed in one year, and that’s it; that exact parent plant will not grow back the following year. So a self-seeding annual has brand new plants that come up every year. The general growing location of that plant variety may be in a similar location, but they are new plants. Self-seeding biennial varieties take two years to reach their full maturity and set seed. Depending on what you want to use the plant for, self-seeding biennials may require a little more patience with one year not being as productive as others. Finally, self-seeding perennials are plants that will continue to grow every year, going through their full flowering & seed cycle every year, and also set seeds for new plants to grow. Self-seeding perennials may require more thinning or transplanting in the Spring, but also not necessarily. Different plants grow at different rates. Also, some plants be a perennial, but in colder climates they are treated as an annual. It helps to understand if they are self-seeding annuals, biennials or perennials, as each one requires slightly different care.
Finally, the only way that self-seeding works is if you let plants live their full life cycle all the way through the wilting. While many gardeners feel it is a necessity to “clean up” the garden at the end of the season, leaving many plants standing in the garden-farm long after they set fruit can be the most important moment when self-seeding happens. Again, this is why it is so important to understand how the self-seeding plants you want to encourage seed themselves. For example, I always leave the sunflower stalks standing in the garden through the snowy months. Typically the seeds are gone by late Fall, but I leave it to the birds to eat and distribute the seeds for next year’s sunflower crop. Leaving sunflowers to stand in their wilted state supports their self-seeding.
WHERE TO START
Below are a few of my favorite edible and medicinal self-seeding varieties, with a little about how they can be used in the various parts of their cycle.
1. Herbs
There are so many herbs that will happily self-seed in your garden-farm. Calendula, chamomile, chives, fennel, borage, oregano, basil, cilantro, dill, parsley, and horseradish to name a few. Some are self-seeding annuals, other self-seeding perennials, and it is useful to know the difference. Either way, herbs are often times the big heavy hitters for attracting and supporting pollinators. Some self-seeding herbs is a must in any garden-farm.
2. Sunflowers
Perhaps one of my favorite, because they seem so happy to sow themselves. With edible seeds for humans and birds alike, immense beauty, cutting flowers, healthy oil producing potential, edible baby sprouts, and consistent food for beneficial insects, sunflowers can’t be beat!
3. Potatoes
Once you start growing potatoes, it can be hard to stop growing them, unless you find every single little potato that was growing in that soil. Forgotten potatoes are one of the best ways to start next year’s crop early. It is important to watch for blight, and not let any potatoes stay in the ground if they show any signs. Also, in order to get optimal growth of each plant, I occasionaly will transplant them in early Spring to give them a little more space, and get their growing more aligned. This great source of Vitamin C is one of my favorite!
4. Tomatoes
Unless you keep an immaculately clean garden, and pick up every single fallen vegetable and weed, you probably have encountered the “volunteer” tomato. One thing that makes for an interesting self-seeding tomato plant is that it already has done the work for you of saving some its most viable seed from the year before; so in theory, your self-seeding tomato is going to be produce some of your most resilient varieties for your particular climate. Another note about self-seeding tomatoes is that since self-seeding borage is such a great companion plant with tomatoes, the two plants can continue to re-seed themselves in partnership.
5. Greens
There are so many tasty and nutritious greens that are self-seeding. Arugula, chard, collards, kale, lettuce, mustards, spinach, and sorrel are just a few of the awesome options of self-seeding greens. I like to add self-seeding radish and turnip into my bed of baby greens as well. Seeding a bed early in the Spring, taking a few harvests before letting them go to seed, will provide a fresh bed of baby greens come late Summer/Fall. And depending on how densely you seed the initial bunch, you may be able to eat some of the spicy flower heads. For the ones that set flower, you will see many beneficial insects coming to share in a harvest while you admire and wait for the next crop.
6. Squash
Anyone with a compost pile who has put the remains of a squash in it have probably experienced the awesome self-seeding potential of the squash. I have seen many a compost pile that just leave the squash plant growing right out of the pile all season. I have also experienced building a lasagna bed using some 80% finished compost where squash came up in the beds. I’ve left it’s sprawling vines as a ground cover to keep out the weeds till the other things I’ve planted get more established and able to shade out the weeds. I’ve also eaten self-seeding squash. The trick about self-seeding squash is that the fruit that grows very well may be a hybrid of different squash if their parent plant was grown within a close proximity to a different variety of squash- causing for cross-pollination. Check out seed-saving distance requirements to get a full-bred variety so that you can plan for how to best space and cultivate your self-seeding squash patch.
7. Wild Edibles
And where would we be without the wild ones? The wild self-seeding plants are some of my favorite because they are so incredibly informative about the needs of the soil and what the next stage of ecological succession looks like. Wild edibles are often medicinal or provide high nutrient levels. Good examples of self-seeding wild edibles that you may consider cultivating in your garden-farm are dandelion, burdock, wild lettuce, lambs quarter, purslane, and plantain to name a few.
The above list is just a selection of self-seeding possibilities and by no means exhaustive. There are so many more flowers, vegetables and herbs that will make a happy home in your garden-farm if you let them. Once you get started you can experiment with more and more. Nature is abundant, and life wants to live! Growing self-seeding varieties will keep your garden going long after you are sowing, and with a little cultivation and attention, it can be one of the most resilient and productive gardens possible. Happy self-seeding!

"Worm composting, or vermicomposting, is one of the easiest and most rewarding ways to compost kitchen scraps. The end product of the composting process is sometimes referred to as Black Gold because it is one of the most nutrient rich sources of fertilizer available. The best thing about worm composting is that it is easy, fun, and cheap and can be done indoors — even in an apartment.
Vermicomposting uses manure worms (not earthworms) to break down decomposing food scraps. The most commonly used manure worms are called red wrigglers and can be bought by the pound online — look on kijiji.
These worms are smaller than the earthworms we are used to seeing when we dig in our gardens.. In the wild they live in forests and work at decomposing the decaying materials on the forest floor. They can also be found — as their name suggests — in steaming piles of manure.
Red wrigglers, the manure worms commercially used for vermicomposting, originate in California so they are not cold­‐hardy. This means, in regions that get a cold winter, they are best suited for indoor bins and are ideal for people who do not have access to a backyard for composting. Vermicomposting is also great for folks who want to supplement their outdoor composting in order to quickly create amazing fertilizer for their gardens and plants.
Here’s how it works: Red wrigglers can eat half their body weight of food scraps each day. They eat the food and quickly pass it through their body. The result — worm poop or vermicompost — is the amazing black gold that is filled with beneficial bacteria and nutrients.
Starting a worm bin
Red wrigglers don’t live deep in soil like earthworms. They live in decaying materials at the surface so they can easily live in small human­‐created composters. You can make a simple worm composting bin out of two plastic storage containers. Drill holes in the sides and bottom of one storage container and put it inside the other one. Drill holes in the lid.
Whe you first receive a package of worms, they will come with some vermicompost and their egg cases. You will need to add some bedding – I use damp shredded newsprint and some grit (sand or ground up eggshells). When you first set up a vermicompost bin, wait a few days before you start feeding the worms kitchen scraps. Start with a small amount — about two cups. Remember to always bury the food under the bedding.
A pound of worms can contain up to 1000 worms. The worms will regulate their population depending on the amount of room they have and the amount of food they are being given. Under ideal situations, a pound of worms can eat up to ½ pound of food scraps every few days. The best way to determine if your worms are being over or underfed is to feed them food — remembering to bury it under the bedding ­‐ and check in a few days later. When it looks like the worms are breaking it down, add more. If there are still a lot of intact food scraps, wait a few more day before feeding them. You will have to replace the bedding periodically. Simply rip some newspaper into strips, soak them in water and wring them out. Fluff them up and put them on top of the worms.
Amazing facts about worms!
1. All worms are intersex. They have both male and female parts and can freely reproduce with each other
2. Worms do not have teeth but have powerful muscles in their mouth that take in the food and move it down their digestive tract.
3. Worms lay (release?) an egg case out of which about 5 baby worms emerge. Looking for egg cases in your worms bin is an easy way to determine how healthy and happy your worms are. They look kind of like dill seeds.
4. Worms do not have eyes but they move, find food, and find each other through their skin, which is sensitive to both touch and light.
5. Some people claim that composting worms can live up to three years!
Feeding your worms

Yes
Harvesting the worm poop
When your worms are healthy and happy they will produce lots of castings. How do you separate the worms and their castings to put this amazing fertilizer onto your garden/plants? You can take a handful and pick out the worms and egg cases but this is a time consuming endeavour.
Here’s an easy way to harvest the castings: take the lid off the bin and put all the bedding and food to one side. Make sure the bin is in a place with bright sunlight or turn on the lights. Most of the worms will eventually crawl over to the side of the bin with the bedding and food. Most will migrate to the bottom of the bin to escape the light. This makes it much easier to get worm­‐free castings (I still pick out any extra worms and egg cases).
You can put the castings directly on your garden or houseplants. You can also make a nutrient­‐rich worm tea for even more impact.
How to make worm compost tea
1. Fill a 5 L bucket with warm water
3. Mix in 1/3 cup of molasses and stir well
4. Put a cup of castings into a nylon and tie it closed
5. Put the “tea bag” in the water
6. Take an aquarium pump and attach to an air stone (you can buy both at pet stores). Put the stone into the bucket and let bubble continuously for 48 hours. This is crucial as it helps the good bacteria to grow.";Permaculture Women's Guild
"Lack of access to land is often raised as a barrier to participation in permaculture. Land ownership in North America — both rural and urban — is prohibitively expensive for many people but many permaculture practices are based on land ownership including the creation of perennial gardens, the growing of food forests, major earthworks such as berms and swales and the building of cob structures. In cities, where public land can be highly contested, the acquiring public or private land for communal projects often requires sustained activist campaigns that are grounded in an understanding of the complex connections between urban land and race, class, and gender. Land in the city tends to be very expensive and zoning rules mean that some practices may be forbidden in certain parts of the city (example: animals considered ‘livestock’).
Although access to land for urban agriculture projects can be an obstacle, people have found a variety of creative ways to overcome this barrier.
Cities contain a lot of public land — more so than in rural areas. Many community gardens are hosted on public — or publically accessible — land. Sometimes community gardens have rules or guidelines that restrict some permaculture techniques, for example, not allowing the planting of perennials or shrubs. You can approach this in a couple of ways, you can work with the city department or organization that oversees the garden to change the rules, or you can plant what you want and beg for forgiveness. Both approaches can work. If you plant what you want in your garden plot, I advise you to be mindful of your neighbours and not plant overly opportunistic plants such as comfrey or mint.
Additionally, there are growing movements around the world for public food forests, community farms and collective apiaries. Collective projects in public spaces can be an important way to begin to reclaim the commons and can help to disrupt the concept of private property. This is an important part of beginning to grapple with what it means to decolonize our cities. We can begin to shift our language and practice from one of ownership of land to one of care-taking and attachment. I have found it very useful to, while retaining my community activism and grassroots organizing, find some allies within city governments whether that be staff or city councillors.
2. Community land trusts
There has been a growing movement for community growing projects on private land (such as vacant lots, private land with short-term leases, or, in some cases, public land with short term leases) to be turned into community land trusts. Many of the community gardens in New York City that were set to be destroyed in the 1990s were saved by a community land trust. This can still bring up some tricky issues about who has the right to control that land. If the land trusts are larger non-profits with a lot of paid staff, there can still be a disconnect to and with the creators of the project. Don’t be discouraged though! There are many examples of grassroots land trust projects that value and practice participatory democracy.
3. Sharing other people’s ‘property’
There are many instances of people who have property sharing it with people who don’t for urban agriculture and permaculture projects. Sometimes this is done between strangers, using a website that matches them. More often it involves friends, family, and neighbours engaging in the kind of sharing that is a cornerstone of a connected community. It can be awkward to approach a neighbour, acquaintance, or even a friend about using their land for a project. As Heather Jo Flores suggests, “Go on, go over there, bring some seeds and a smile, and ask!” Even after they say yes, it means delicately negotiating some sort of mutually beneficial agreement about how the land will be used, by whom, and for how long. This is another reason why social permaculture is so crucial, and potentially amazing. You might not get the answer you want but you might find the possibilities for collaboration and creativity to be even greater than you hoped.
4. Accepting temporary access
As mentioned above, sometimes people can only get temporary access to land in cities. They may be renting their apartment or home, or a community project may only be given a temporary lease. It can be helpful to think of your project/design as part of a larger urban ecosystem. As Flores beautifully points out in Food not Lawns, “Growing ecological gardens, wherever you can, is never a waste of time. Nothing lasts forever, and if you can get a few baskets of food without damaging the environment, and perhaps leave behind some long-living fruit trees, then the larger ecological community will surely benefit from your labors. If you can do these things while also educating others, then your work will succeed many times over” (p. 24).
While your project may be temporary, it may have long-lasting positive effects about which you may never fully know. For example, maybe your temporary project inspired a community activist to create a similar project in another part of the city. Or maybe your pollinator garden, although only in existence for the time you rented your house, helped a species of native bee to thrive in your neighbourhood. Or, maybe you gained skills in permaculture design that you were able to use to create a future, more permanent space. I encourage you to not be daunted or discouraged by temporary access to land.
5. Gardening in containers
If you don’t have ground in which to plant, consider container gardening. It utilizes permaculture principles beautifully because an important aspect of urban permaculture is knowing how to create small, intensive projects. The best part of container gardening is that if you rent your home or apartment, you can take your garden with you! For years a productive gooseberry bush in a container moved with me.
6. Guerilla Gardening
Many now established gardens got their start as guerilla gardens, i.e. people gardening on land without permission of the landowner. This is often done in vacant lots but people have also planted fruit trees in public parks and put garden baskets on public streetscapes. These projects may become permanent or they may be destroyed but they have several benefits. One, they add to ecological health and biodiversity for as long as they exist and two, they encourage people to ask challenging and critical questions about city design and the food system.
One word of caution: in order to not replicate racism and/or classism, I recommend that you guerilla garden in your own neighbourhood. Sometimes well meaning people try to initiate urban agriculture or permaculture projects in neighbourhoods that are not their own and may, unwittingly or not, be part of marginalizing or alienating people in that community. Don’t decide for others what they need: focus on the communities in which you are already well-integrated and then work in solidarity with other communities and neighbourhood.
These strategies for accessing land in cities may seem time-consuming especially the ones that require working together with other people. But the process of engaging with these strategies may lead to rewards greater than gaining access to land. You may find that you create a more connected neighbourhood in the process, make new friends, gain valuable interpersonal and organizing skills, and/or increase your knowledge about growing plants in tricky spaces. You might find, as I have, that even when you gain permanent access to private land you still seek out and organize collective initiatives in your community because of the abundance and joy it brings to your life.
A note about polluted land
As a general rule, do not establish a garden near a railway line or on land known to contain lead, other heavy metals, or a concentration of chemicals (such as a former garbage dump). If you are in doubt, you have a few options. One, is to have your soil tested. This can be costly but some cities are devising ways to allow residents to test soil for free or at low cost. Another option is to build raised beds on top of contaminated soil, with a barrier between the original soil and the added soil. Lastly, you can explore bioremediation especially with plants that are dynamic accumulators and with mushrooms. A warning, it is hard to remove lead and some very toxic chemicals from soil in this way.

Every growing season, vine-ripened tomatoes are, without a doubt, one of my favorite yields from my annual vegetable garden. From delicately placing the seeds in pots to babying them through the cooler spring weeks and seeing them explode with fruit during the summer, tomatoes are one of the few garden harvests where I’m willing to make an extra effort. There is no comparison between the tasteless store-bought tomatoes and my heirloom varieties. I’ll admit it, I am a tomato snob.
Being a tomato grower in Montana, however, is not for the faint of heart. With our 90 day growing season, wet cool springs, hot dry summers and early fall frosts, the odds are often stacked against us. So when we’re nearing the end of the growing season at the end of August, there is a danger that those luscious green tomatoes on the vine will never see their true color before the gardening season comes to an end. And let’s face it, there are only so many fried green tomatoes that you can eat.
In my video below, I talk about how to ripen your tomatoes when you have a short growing season. In it, I explain a few easy tips that will help your tomatoes mature on time. These tips are so effective that I barely end up eating any green tomatoes!";Permaculture Women's Guild
"At the end of the growing season last year, one of my volunteers remarked, “I think you have given us hundreds of dollars worth of vegetables this fall.” Indeed, growing your own garden often means that you are saving money on produce that would normally cost a lot of money in the grocery store, especially if it’s organic.
However, with the money you invest in compost, seeds, and plants each season, not to mention the time, sometimes the vegetables or fruit that you’re harvesting from your garden seem like they are worth their weight in gold. Granted, there are so many intangible benefits to having a garden and I would never give up gardening because the ‘numbers don’t pencil.’ But, it is also possible to grow delicious and healthy food without breaking the bank.
In my video below, I go over my Top Ten Tips for Gardening on a Budget.

Traditionally, we are an agricultural nation so caring for seeds and for the Earth in general aligns with our cultural values and has been handed down from one generation to the next over millennia. There’s a lineage of people cultivating relationship to their food and to the Mother Earth. We have quite a number of heritage and traditional varieties of corn, beans, squash, sunflowers, tobacco and other plants that have been specifically handed down through many generations over the last several thousand years as a part of our traditional food ways. I have the great honor of being one of the seed keepers of the Mohawk people which means that, together with others, I am making sure that the seeds stay alive and healthy and that they’re given freely within our community, as well as passed down to the next generations.
Sounds like a true passion.
It is a real passion. Due to the impacts of colonization and acculturation many of native North American food systems have been dismantled and unfortunately, they are not a part of our everyday life anymore. As a teenager I didn’t really have access to a lot of the traditional foods and to the cultural memory that goes with them. As a young woman I became interested in traditional farming and wanted to learn more about where our food comes from and to create more sovereignty and freedom through cultivation. That’s how I opened this Pandora’s box of the world of heirloom seeds… and wow!
It turns out that not only do seeds have this incredible diversity — a prism of different colors and shapes and sizes and places where they grow best and communities that they come from — but that they also carry stories and beautiful lineages of relationships.
For Mohawk people agriculture was historically at the center of our culture and I was very curious why it no longer was a significant part of my life and how I could reengage and restore that relationship and connection to the land. So I began to ask people, gather seeds and learn more and more about my responsibility to care for them. It led me on a 20-year-long path to being a seed keeper. Being an educator and a mentor constitutes a central part of this role. I am helping people who are in a similar situation I was 20 years ago — curious but not having access to knowledge or seeds. I am passing this knowledge I received from the elders and mentors of mine within the community because I honor the importance of keeping these traditional seeds alive together with the cultural memory that is attached to them.
Busy life!
It is. I run a seed co-operative. We have a 10-acre farm that focuses on stewardship of seeds and education of people about seed care and growing food in holistic ways. I am also the national program coordinator for the Indigenous Seedkeepers Network — a program of the Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance, which works with a number of different tribal communities to create seed libraries and banks and also to build mentorship networks to leverage resources around policy for protecting our seeds against biopiracy, biocolonialism and patenting. I travel all over North America to see tribal communities and facilitate workshops and conversations around how communities are creating these resources in their lives. So that’s my work in a nutshell. It’s complex and multilayered but it’s also a beautiful path to follow. The seeds have guided me well along my path.
So would you say that seed keeping could be seen as a decolonization movement?
Absolutely.
To me decolonization is the foundation of the seed sovereignty movement. But I also like to put a positive spin on it: it’s re-indigenising.
We are claiming back our traditions and rehydrating those original agreements that we had with the plants and with our ancestors but also with our descendants. It doesn’t happen only in Native American nations. Across the globe communities start to recognize the importance of durable, resilient, local food systems. Local engagement has been growing the incredible momentum in the last several decades. The Seed Freedom Movement is a part of it because we recognize that we cannot have a durable and resilient local food system if we don’t have locally adapted seeds that are a part of it. Seeds are the foundation of agriculture but they also encode a memory of the land, the climate, the weather, as well as people’s cultural values, aesthetics and stories. And now people of all generations are coming together to recognize the importance of seed heritage, to create new ways to counteract the globalization and industrialization of our food systems, to resist monocultures. At the heart of what I do is the creation of the seed literacy. Even if you’re not a farmer or a gardener, seed is a vitally important thing in your life because we all eat.
Among Mohawk people the women were traditionally responsible for seed keeping. Is it still the case within this modern growing movement?
Historically in most cultures — although I can confidently talk only about the Mohawks — seeds were considered feminine. It relates to our own reproductive system — it’s the woman who carries the seed. If you look botanically, it’s the female part of the plant that is creating the seed, so this is a feminine expression of the plant’s life cycle. In our tradition and in many cultures and traditions across the globe seeds have traditionally been considered a feminine aspect of the agricultural system and largely it’s been the responsibility of women to care for them.
In your writing you are using this beautiful word — rematriation.
We’ve been using it in a lot of different contexts. Primarily it’s about restoring the feminine back into our lives through our food systems and recognizing that many of the industrial global food systems are very patriarchal, so it’s about creating that balance. Our traditional knowledge wasn’t about women being more powerful than men or the other way round. The point was to maintain that egalitarian balance between the masculine and the feminine.
Rematriation in relation to seeds is about bringing the seeds back home into their original context and into their communities of origin. Speaking more broadly, rematriation is about restoring that feminine energy back into our lives and our communities.
I learned of the word through a man named Martin Prechtel. In my latest blog post I quote a piece from his book “The Unlikely Peace of Cuchamaquic” — he speaks very eloquently about the idea of rematriation, about that holy feminine being restored back into our lives. Among native peoples we talk a lot about repatriation of things back into our communities. So in this case we decided to use a more feminine word. It’s inspired by the work of Martin Prechtel but also by the legacy and lineage within indigenous communities.
Is it relatively easy to engage young people in such work?
For many years there had been this generation gap. Older people were keeping traditions and seeds alive but younger ones didn’t engage, didn’t see it as relevant. But now I’m witnessing a resurgence of the movement among the younger folks in tribal and farming communities but also in a more mainstream culture. People are waking up to the fact that the monocropped way of life and industrialization of everything is damaging not only to the nature but also to our relationship with the world. Young people these days are inheriting a world that is deeply troubled. In a way they know they have to do something and they are enraged. Stewarding seeds is such a powerful, beautiful and inspiring path to follow. It’s a hopeful form of activism. It’s very tangible and it creates something positive to work for instead of working against something else.
We have to be good future ancestors and responsible descendants, so it’s our responsibility to care for the seeds to make sure that younger generations and future generations that we might not know yet have them.
I have a teenage daughter who’s been growing up on a seed farm so this way of eating is her life from day one. She has a great passion for the culinary arts. She wants to be a chef. There’s a spectrum of ways in which young people can engage in this kind of work. If you’re interested in farming or gardening, that’s great but you might as well be a chef, an artist, an activist, a public speaker. There are many different ways to contribute. A lot of our work in the seed sovereignty movement evolves around inclusivity — how we can acknowledge the gifts that different people can bring to the table and how to make sure that a well-rounded resilient food system has many people contributing in various creative ways so it’s not only about growing food.
You also say that seeds are living beings and our relatives. Can you unpack it a bit for people who haven’t grown up within a Native American community and may have a problem with relating to it?
Sure. All of us — and that includes everyone who is reading it now — descend from a lineage of people who had a very intimate relationship with plants. It’s just in the last couple of hundred years of human history we’ve been looking at seeds and food in general as a commodity as opposed to something that was an integral part of our life that we shared. It used to be a commons, a collective inheritance. A long time ago our ancestors — mine, yours, everyone else’s — made agreements with plants that they would take care of each other. There is this intimacy, there are familial relationships that are encoded in creation stories that are held within many different ancestries and bloodlines.
So when I say that seeds are sacred because they are living relatives, I mean it wholeheartedly. That’s how I view seeds and that’s how pretty much all of humanity saw seeds up to a certain point.
Then it started to get industrialized and commodified and our collective view of what seeds represented has changed. I like to remind people that 200 years ago in the United States and in Europe there were no seed companies. People shared and traded seeds instead. I like to tell people to think deeply about their relationship with their food and with the seeds that make this food. If you trace back different cultural lineages, you’ll see that plants and seeds played significant roles in cosmologies and worldviews. In the Mohawk creation story such foods as corn, beans, squash, sunflowers and strawberries figure prominently. They grew from the body of the daughter of the original woman as a gift to her sons. These foods would then sustain them for the rest of their time here on Earth and they literally grew from her flesh and bones. So in our cosmology we see them as our relatives. We have an agreement with them that they would nourish us every day but we have to give back. That’s a reciprocal relationship.
So now, in North America but also globally, we need to rethink and rewrite the narrative of our relationship with food and seed. At the moment there is a dominant narrative in the Western world that sees plants as dead inanimate objects that we just grow, harvest, mechanize and exploit. But that dominant narrative is really just a shallow facade around a much deeper relationship that humans have had with plants for a lot longer. So in our educational seed co-operative Sierra Seeds we challenge that dominant narrative.
This is a radically different view to the one held by mainstream agricultural companies. You are promoting it now not only through Sierra Seeds in the US — recently you joined the faculty of over 40 women who teach the Permaculture Women’s Guild Online Permaculture Design Course where you run a module on seed keeping. It is not a regular part of the PDC curriculum, is it?
It isn’t indeed. Permaculture is a fantastic curriculum and a beautiful pedagogy — a wonderful system of knowledge that has been distilled down from a much larger traditional ecological body of knowledge originating all around the world and I think many of us within the movement acknowledge that. There is a very particular curriculum of 72 hours of teaching that accompanies the PDC and seed stewardship isn’t a part of it but then… how can it not be a part of it? Seed stewardship should be an integral part of every farmer’s garden and it was — until a hundred or two hundred years ago. So when we’re talking about permaculture and creating holistic food systems, the seed has an inherent place within it. People need to know how to steward seed and how to cultivate seed that’s regionally adapted to a very specific place and to their own unique low input permaculture system. So I approached the creators of this course and said: “Hey, what if we include a module on holistic seed stewardship?”.
The seed is the beginning. It’s so vitally important to the foundation of all food systems but at the same time most seeds available now aren’t adapted to low input polyculture or permaculture systems.
They have been bred and selected for monoculture in a very different farming system. That’s why I think that for people who are meant to obtain a certificate in permaculture design it’s important not to forget about saving seeds. I feel super thrilled to contribute to this course and hold a little corner of that space to really honor the seeds and all that they give us.
One more thing… I’m sure that everyone who got to this point of our conversation feels like me. I buy the majority of my vegetables from a local farming co-operative so the veggies I eat are local, culturally appropriate and organic. But as a city dweller with a small garden I throw away most of these really good seeds and now I feel super-bad. Any advice for folks like me?
The beautiful thing about this growing seed sovereignty movement is that there are many different community projects and initiatives that are springing up wherever people come together to think creatively about how we can develop more access to good seeds within our communities. So in a lot of places, especially in urban environments, there are seed libraries and seed exchange — places where people help to facilitate the distribution and collection of these seeds. So I would recommend that folks, who don’t have a lot of capacity in their life to do a lot of seed stewardship in their own garden or allotment, connect with the wider community. Seed libraries are popping up — it’s worth to look for a local one and share your surplus of seeds there.
The beauty of a seed is that it multiplies exponentially. It is a wonderful example of the natural abundance of the Earth and I think it is also a beautiful expression of the gift economy. Even keepers like myself always have more seeds than we need. It inspires me to be generous and to give seeds outside of my own home farm. The seeds teach us to be generous and to share our abundance with other people and this is really the true nature of things. We live in a society where the dominant narrative is based on scarcity and austerity, so we need to start paying attention to seeds because they remind us of the inherent generosity of the Earth and of our own inherently generous nature.

This old-world skill is best learned experientially, and within a community of fellow seedpeople. But here are some tips to get you started, even if you only have a small garden.
Selection
Some plants are much easier for beginners. This has less to do with ease of harvest than with whether or not the plant needs a large or isolated population to produce viable seed. For reasons we don’t have space to explore in this article, saving seeds from cucumbers, squash, corn and most plants in the Brassica family (kale, cabbage, broccoli) is best left for experienced farmers who have the space and knowledge to make sure those seeds have been bred in a way that maintains their genetic diversity and integrity. On a home scale, I recommend starting with the easy ones: lettuce, beets, carrots, celery, tomatoes, onions, beans and plants in the mint family (most of your culinary herbs.)
Maturity
Most of the vegetables we eat are just babies when we harvest them for the table. But to save seeds, let the plant mature completely. Heads of lettuce will elongate and shoot up flower stalks covered in tiny, yellow dandelion-like blooms. Onions will send up a pointy bud that will open up into a globular white cluster. Beets, carrots and celery are biennial, so their seeds won’t mature until the second year. Tomatoes and peppers, when harvested for seed, should be much riper than most of us prefer for fresh eating.
Harvest and Processing
There are two distinct types of seed processing: dry and wet.
Dry Processing
Make sure the seeds are fully formed and have started to dry. A good test is if they shake easily into your hand. If the seed is still very firmly attached to the plant, it probably hasn’t matured. When you harvest, don’t try to remove the individual seeds in the field. This can cause a lot of waste. Just cut the whole seed-head carefully into a paper sack and move to a sheltered spot where you can clean it.
As soon as you harvest, create detailed labels with as much information as you know. Include date of harvest, date of planting, species and variety names, where in the garden it grew best, where you originally got the seed, and why you liked this particular variety enough to save seed from it. Keep these notes with the seeds, and you will always have the information at your fingertips.
Most seeds mature within a protective coating called chaff. To process seeds for storage and replanting later, we must first remove the chaff; otherwise it will rot in storage and cause the seeds to decay. To remove the bulk of the chaff, pour the seed heads onto a clean tarp spread on the ground or a large table. Fold the seeds into the tarp like a burrito, making sure the corners won’t leak. Stomp, smash and dance on the tarp, and then carefully open it back up. Avoid getting a lot of dirt and other contaminants into the seeds.
Now you are ready for winnowing. On a large scale, this is best done with fans and screens, but on a small scale you can just do it with a medium-sized round bowl and your mouth. Put the seed into the bowl a little at a time and swirl it around, blowing gently. The chaff, which is lighter, will lift up and blow away, while the seed, heavy with genetic material, will sink. Pick the last few specks of chaff out with your fingers and place the clean seed on a piece of paper in a standard electric food dehydrator on the lowest setting (around 96 degrees) overnight. You could also dry your seed on a dark shelf for at least two weeks, but I prefer the dehydrator so I don’t have to worry about mice, ants and ambient moisture ruining my crop.
Wet Processing
If the seed is encased in a juicy fruit, such as tomatoes, use this method to remove the slimy seed coat so that the seeds last longer in storage. This not only gets rid of the slime, it also kills any seed-borne diseases and ensures your seed will survive in storage for up to several years.
Squish the seeds into a jar. Add a small amount of water, place a piece of cardboard over the top to let air in but keep bugs out, and set the jar aside. Pick a spot that is not in your kitchen, because it will definitely stink! Within a week, a thick skin of mold will form on top, and the mature seeds will sink to the bottom. Now, fill the container to the top with water and carefully pour off the mold on top. Rinse the seeds a few more times, until the water is clear, then strain them. Now they’re ready for the dehydrator.
Storage
Store seeds in a cool, dry, dark place. I store mine in paper envelopes inside insulated picnic coolers, available for a few dollars at any thrift store. If you save peas or fava beans, watch out for weevils, which are very common. You won’t be able to tell if your seed has the weevil larvae inside, but store them in the freezer and you can be sure they will die. Also freeze seeds from members of the Allium family, such as onions, leeks and chives, which are particularly short lived — they last much longer when frozen. The longevity and viability of your seeds will be largely dependent on storage conditions, so don’t overlook this important step.

Parece una cosa bastante obvia, pero que si la entendemos verdaderamente (no con la mente, sino con las entrañas) promete abrir muchas puertas que mantenemos cerradas en nuestro interior y que piden ser abiertas: somos Naturaleza. Nacimos de ella y por ella, formamos parte de ella, y cada célula de nuestro cuerpo es Naturaleza por derecho propio. Incluso si vivimos en ciudades y llevamos vidas tecnológicamente avanzadas, no engañamos a nadie: somos Naturaleza.
En la civilización occidental actual, moldeada desde hace siglos por el capitalismo-patriarcado, hemos perdido gran parte del contacto con lo natural: tanto la biodiversidad que está ahí fuera, como la esencia dentro de cada una de nosotras. Con ello hemos ido olvidando saberes ancestrales de vital importancia, conocimientos de nuestros propios ciclos naturales que son imprescindibles para nuestro buen desarrollo como criaturas vivas de esta Tierra. Tal vez seas una mujer en contacto con la Naturaleza, cultives tus alimentos y entiendas bien los ciclos de crecimiento de las plantas y animales a tu cuidado, pero tal vez estés descuidando el conocimiento y cuidado de tu propia naturaleza.
Aunque a menudo se nos olvide, ser mujer quiere decir ser humana, ser humana quiere decir ser animal, ser animal quiere decir ser parte de la vida de la Tierra, que quiere decir ser parte del Cosmos. Nuestros cuerpos y todo lo que existe en nuestro planeta es polvo de estrellas, literalmente. Estamos hechas de la misma materia y energía que todo lo demás, somos Uno con Todo lo que es. Darse cuenta de esto puede dar un poco de vértigo, pero también es una hermosa experiencia de comunión con la Naturaleza que somos y el primer paso para comprendernos mejor y vivir mejor nuestras vidas.
Intuición e instinto: la voz de la Naturaleza
Como mejor podemos entender esto no es con la mente, sino con la intuición y la experiencia, con el cuerpo, los sentidos y las emociones, con la conexión con ese lado instintivo que seguimos llevando dentro. La intuición es la percepción directa y espontánea de la realidad, sin el filtro racional de la mente. Tiene más que ver con el sentir que con el pensar: es la voz de la Naturaleza que nos habla desde la sabiduría de nuestro ser más profundo.
En nuestra sociedad, lo irracional está bastante mal visto, y todo conocimiento adquirido por este medio es comúnmente descartado, por ser considerado mucho menos fiable y legítimo que el obtenido mediante procesos mentales, más “civilizados”. Esto me parece, como poco, escandaloso: la intuición permitió nuestra evolución como especie y nuestra supervivencia individual, y sigue siendo vital para cada una de nosotras, pues está fuertemente ligada a la creatividad y la libertad personal.
Lamentablemente, el ataque contra nuestra animalidad y nuestros instintos es una de las bases del sistema capitalista-patriarcal en el que vivimos.En otras culturas que no se rigen por este sistema, las llamadas despectivamente “primitivas”, la importancia que se le da a la intuición y a lo irracional, deja la puerta abierta a la creatividad, al misterio, a lo mágico y lo sagrado, a lo que nos conecta, en fin, con nuestra naturaleza profunda y con todo lo que es.
Hacer consciente esta conexión con el resto de seres conlleva un mayor respeto hacia la Tierra, entendiendo que sólo somos una parte más de ésta y que la podemos utilizar, pero sólo hasta donde sea realmente necesario y nada más, en vez de usarla para seguir alimentando la autodestructiva rueda del capitalismo.
Ciclicidad: nuestros patrones interiores
Como todo lo demás, desde los ciclos vitales de otros animales, a las estaciones, hasta el movimiento matemático de los planetas y galaxias, estamos en permanente movimiento y cambio, cumplimos ciclos a varias escalas. Somos parte de la ritmicidad de la Vida y somos interdependientes con el resto de especies: todos cumplimos una función esencial.
Nuestro avance no se hace en línea recta, pese a lo que nos inculcan con la capitalista noción de “progreso”. El devenir de los seres humanos y de la Naturaleza se puede visualizar mejor como una espiral ascendente: un ciclo donde Vida y Muerte se alternan a cada momento, en cada fase. No entendemos aquí la Muerte como el fin de las cosas, sino como el fin de un ciclo y la posibilidad de regeneración y nueva creación. La Muerte, a todos los niveles, es tan necesaria como la Vida, como bien sabemos en cuanto nos ponemos a observar los patrones en la Naturaleza.
Es curioso como este ciclo puede ser visto en todo lo que es, desde lo macro hasta lo micro, fuera y dentro de nosotras. Uno de los ejemplos más claros es el ciclo menstrual por el que pasamos las mujeres mensualmente. Cada mes es una oportunidad de nacimiento, crecimiento, decaimiento y muerte simbólica que lleva a un nuevo comienzo. Es muy probable que, al igual que los ritmos biológicos de muchos animales y vegetales, este ciclo esté pautado por la Luna.
La toma de conciencia de la existencia de las diferentes fases por las que pasamos al mes no sólo nos puede ayudar a entender mejor los cambios físicos por los que pasamos en la menstruación y tomar las riendas de nuestra fertilidad y salud ginecológica, sino que además nos da herramientas para comprender nuestras fluctuaciones emocionales, que no son en absoluto aleatorias. Se trata de patrones cíclicos y naturales, es decir, perfectamente normales. Este tema ha sido hermosamente explorado, entre muchas otras, por Miranda Gray en su obra esencial Luna Roja.
Igual que entendemos que las plantas no pueden florecer constantemente, es bueno recordar que nosotras tampoco, que hay momentos para todo y que podemos predecirlos si nos observamos y estudiamos. Y así, al igual que hacemos en nuestro huerto, beneficiarnos del hecho de trabajar a favor de los dictados de la Naturaleza, y no en contra.
Somos un ecosistema interconectado: la salud holística
Así como entendemos la importancia de las relaciones sabiamente entretejidas entre todos los elementos de la Naturaleza, es importante pensarnos de la misma manera: somos un ecosistema interconectado. No somos sólo un cuerpo físico, sino que nuestro ser tiene otras dimensiones igualmente importantes y que trabajan en conjunto para una óptima salud. Somos cuerpo, mente, emociones, energía: muchas partes que funcionan como un todo.
Un desajuste en una parte de este sistema acarrea problemas en las demás partes, y “no hay ninguna enfermedad que no sea simultáneamente mental, emocional y física”. Esto es así porque “nuestras emociones y pensamientos están siempre acompañados por reacciones bioquímicas de nuestro cuerpo” y viceversa (Christiane Northrup en Cuerpo de Mujer, Sabiduría de Mujer).
La medicina alopática (la normalizada en Occidente) es parte del sistema patriarcal-capitalista, y suele ver al cuerpo como campo de batalla contra la enfermedad, sin tener en cuenta que nuestro estado natural y normal es la Salud y sin considerar las otras partes de nuestro ser a la hora de prescribir un tratamiento.
La medicina que sí considera la sanación del conjunto físico-mental-emocional se conoce como medicina holística (del griego holos: todo, entero), y se caracteriza por ver más allá de los síntomas y buscar las causas profundas de la enfermedad a todos los niveles. Dando con el problema, se encuentra la solución.
Además, somos un sistema abierto, somos parte del ecosistema a mayor escala, por lo que los cambios en nuestro entorno también nos afectan. “Nuestros cuerpos son campos dinámicos de energía en permanente cambio, no estructuras físicas estáticas”. Somos afectadas (y afectamos) por lo que tenemos alrededor, ya que “no acabamos donde acaba nuestra piel” (Christiane Northrup).
Al igual que nos alimentamos con la comida y el agua, lo hacemos con la luz y el aire, y la energía de los seres que nos rodean también nos influye. De ahí la importancia de vivir en un lugar saludable, en contacto (literal) con la Naturaleza de la que somos parte, en espacios abiertos, y de crear un círculo afectivo sano y una manera de relacionarnos con los otros y con el medio que sea positiva para nuestro ser en conjunto: el cuerpo-mente-emociones que somos y la Vida que formamos entre todos.
Ideas para interiorizar nuestro ecosistema interior
Para volver a conectar con la pulsación natural de nuestros cuerpos y emociones basta con observarnos. Así como funciona afuera, funciona adentro, por lo que observar los ciclos, patrones e interconexiones de la Naturaleza también es de gran ayuda si los ponemos en relación con nuestro interior.

They say the best way to avoid your own tantrum is to count to ten.
It’s never worked for me.
This is how it goes:

If you’re like me, read on.
Here we go: Partner gave you the ugly look early in the morning, toddler smeared jam on your pants, cat pooed in the plant pot, your idea got shot down in the meeting, your teenager called you the worst parent ever and you cannot even get the damn cheese pack open. Forget breathing. There’s not enough air in this world to breathe all that crap away.
This is what works for me instead.
See yourself and the situation in the movie. If that alone is not funny enough, make it funny. Turn it into a cartoon. Exaggerate it. Blow it up into the ridiculous.
Hubby or wifey gave you the bad eye: Boooooooooooo-end-of-the-world-hooooooo! How can she do this to me? This is the end! My life is over! I will never love again!
Do it. Until you laugh.
You missed the train? “Oh no, not I, I will survive!” (Gloria Gaynor)
You accidentally dropped your coffee on your pants? “You’re simply the best! Better than all the rest! Better than aaanyone.” (Tina Turner)
Christmas time and you’re upset with your partner? “You’re a bum, you’re a punk. You’re an old slut on junk. Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed. You scumbag, you maggot, you cheap lousy faggot. Happy Christmas your arse, I pray God it’s our last.” (The Pogues with Kirsty MacColl)
 Sing out loud.
Our egos have a tendency (ahem) to blow things out of proportion. Usually, we see that after the damage is done and the day is ruined. How about we look at it before?
So, the boss said you have to rewrite that proposal. The one you’ve worked on for three days into the night.
Imagine yourself: You’ve been through rehab and spent the last two years in an institution. Today you have another conversation with your favorite therapist.
Therapist: “Now dear. Do you think you’re ready to return home?”
You: “Dunno, doc. I mean it’s tough. It’s really tough, you know? [start blubbering] I worked so hard on that proposal [sniff, sniff] and then she came and just brutally.. [sneeeeeze], brutally… [can’t continue, sobbing]” Therapist throws a pill and breathes deeply.
You get the picture.
I just did that today, when I consistently failed to open a Gouda cheese package: “Sad: Woman Starves Next to Full Cheese Package.”
Stressed by a particular person or a whole group? Holidays are coming up. You find yourself in the company of people that do not make you happy. (How dare they?)
Here’s what you do. What animal represents them best? When your father, mother, sibling, in-law starts doing what annoys you most, picture them with that animal’s head. Takes the edge out of it, doesn’t it?

One of the most impactful books I have ever read was The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which is a memoir transcribed to a personal assistant by a French Journalist, Jean-Dominique Bauby. Where the autobiographical tale picks up, he had spent several years with a rare and completely debilitating condition called locked-in syndrome. It is a beautifully recounted, brave and soulful work.
It hit a deep chord because I was also working as a personal assistant for a man in his mid-thirties who had become tetraplegic in his late teens. He had been unable to move anything below his neck after diving into a too shallow swimming pool. There was so much that broke my heart about his story and taught me grace and humility in catastrophe.
Something profound can happen when a world shrinks and its not always an immediate light-filled growth opportunity. I don’t think mindless optimism gets us there either. What shines through this book is the authors growing sense of enchantment and awe at the small irreplaceable, ordinary details of his life. There is a deep affection for people and places that is contagious, palpable and so obviously alluded him in his previous life, before the illness.
He had been attractive, successful and ambitious: a go-getter with the world at his proverbial feet. But, nothing had ever quite been enough. There was always more to gain the next conquest; the new challenge which negated any real connection with all the abundances which surrounded him.
I am on day three or so of very little normal social too-ing and fro-ing, and as I was walking today in the still chilly spring sunshine, this book came back to me. It struck me as the perfect metaphor for our current situation globally with all the distancing and what we face interculturally, around the world in the face of lockdown in this bizarre new set of circumstances.
Our dominant narrative is currently silent or at least muffled. We don’t know how long for or if anything will go ever back to “normal” or what we have come to believe is normal. Our overriding myth for so long has been one of “more” and ruthless progress. Even if you know this to be a false one, it’s hard not to follow along. Likely the big top-down answers will start to filter in soon with this domination obsession before too long. And it could be a painful, dangerous pause for many.
But, we have an opportunity to take a moment to connect to what is alive within us and surrounding us. To release what isn’t whole or needed and consciously make time for those things that are still living. For me today, it was the softly breathing earth coming back to life after winter and the faces of my children still softly wrapped in childhood.
It could be a time to appreciate the abundances and heal the hurts we have had and carry this pause with us and start to let in the droplets of beauty and connection that are waiting to quench our hunger. And, begin to shape our own stories.

As always, I was fascinated by what happened in Davos this year. If not necessarily encouraged. Donald Trump criticised climate ’prophets of doom’, pronouncing the amazingness of the USA and promoting their fracked gas as a safe solution to energy security. On the same stage, Greta Thunberg gave all the adults in the room a good talking to about the rapid action needed to tackle climate and ecological breakdown to provide her generation with a future that they can thrive in. HRH The Prince of Wales told us that we have just ten years to get our act together. And an interesting BBC documentary on population, consumption and the outlook if we keep growing both. Which was a first and, in my opinion, welcome discussion of the issues.
It seems to me that population and consumption growth are at the heart of our current crises. And talking about them is still a taboo. In right wing circles it’s an excuse to lay the blame for the world’s problems at the feet of poor countries with high birth rates, whilst frowning on contraception. On the left, it’s impossible to discuss without being accused of wanting to deny fundamental human rights to reproduce and live well. And there are endless discussions about becoming more efficient and changing consumption patterns to accommodate more people. When we know, deep down, that this only slows down progress to the same destination. See Sheri S Temper’s excellent book ‘Beauty’ for a frightening vision of what this future could look like. Surely it is time to think a bit more rationally about this? After all, physics would suggest that we can’t continue to expand without breaking the system at some point. Which means we need to rethink our assumption that we can have what we want, when we want it, with no thoughts to the consequences. And being intentional about bringing more people into the world strikes me as a good place to start.
From a personal perspective, I am purposefully childfree. Both in the sense that I chose not to have children and that I am using my childfree life to do my best to help create a world where all children — human and other species — can live well, now and in the future. It was a hard decision to make and an even harder one to stick to. I had always wanted to be a mother. I didn’t think life could be complete without a family of my own. But as I became settled and started to feel ready to become a mum, my husband and I realised that we couldn’t bring new people into the world. Not at a time when we seem to be hell bent on undermining the life support systems we depend on. When the last thing it seemed the world needed was another spoilt English kid. Let alone thinking about what their future might look like with nature stripped bare and getting on for 10 billion people by the time they are thirty. So, we don’t have children. Now, as I move into my late 40’s, I can start to appreciate what I have developed and become as a result of being childfree. But I have gone through a full process of grieving for the children we never had, coupled with such strong biological urges to have a baby that it was incredibly painful at times. I still feel wistful on occasion when I see families having fun. Less so when I witness toddler tantrums and teenage rebellions!
It is not for me to judge or to tell others how to live. Children are a joy and reproducing important for the future of humanity. But I know that women (and the men in their lives) are increasingly worried about having children in a climate emergency. (Thanks to my friend, Catherine Van Loo for letting me use her photo from the September Climate Strikes here!) My question therefore is how can we make it less of a taboo to be childfree and enable people to feel good about putting their energies into birthing and raising a new way of being in the world, rather than their own families? I know I have experienced too many upsetting conversations where people with children have questioned my decision, told me I’m wrong and will regret it, am selfish and not a proper woman. Even relative strangers. So how can we all support each other so that we can create a better world together?
I believe that the Dalai Lama was right when he said that western women have the potential to save the world. And I feel that childfree western women have a special contribution to make.
Whilst our sisters invest their energy into nurturing the next generation, we can focus on changing memes and nurturing a culture that will start to restore the health of communities of people and nature so that the next generation can look forward to their future. Step into our uniquely feminine powers and develop new ways to lead, at home, at work and in our communities, so that we can bring balance and a different perspective to important decisions that need to be made in all spheres of life. To own our roles as equals in the world and make our voices heard. The role of women has always been to nurture the future. We need that now more than ever and for some of us it involves not having children and finding our own unique path to fulfillment and contribution. But most importantly, we must support each other, with kindness, understanding and appreciation — whether we are mothers or not. We can be the change we want to see in the world, with a little courage, faith and solidarity. Let’s do it!
If any of what I have said chimes with you, please do get in touch. I have created the ‘Purposefully Childfree’ network with groups on Facebook and LinkedIn and am starting the 21st Century Grown Ups project, figuring out how to design a good urban life that maximises my contribution to tackling our shared social and environmental challenges. I have created a free guide to boosting your wellbeing in a climate emergency that you can find at my website — www.gudruncartwright.com. I look forward to connecting.

What do we do with emotions that feel bad? How do we turn our miseries into rich nourishing resources, into love and constructive action?
When we try to throw things out that smell bad, they don’t go away. That applies to emotions as much as food scraps and poo. We put our ‘waste’ in the compost heap so as not to waste rich resources: we know it transforms into nutritious soil. You gardeners and permaculturists, isn’t compost our greatest delight and joy? How many happy hours have I spent discussing our most exciting creative endeavour, compost toilets?
Can we love our heart’s compost with equal delight? Can we rub our hands with glee and say, oh great! all my despair and misery will produce lots of rich emotional soil, and that’ll feed everyone else too!
HOW DO WE COMPOST HUMAN EMOTIONS?
WHAT IS COMPOST IN A HUMAN HEART? Our heart’s pains, grief, anger, hurt, loneliness, we often reject like waste, and don’t want to know about.
Climate change is bearing down on us. More and more of what goes in our compost heap now is climate change fears, fury and powerlessness. I’m freaked out about methane levels right now. Has it gone out of control?
We often call these ‘negatives’, and pretend they’re not happening; we should be able to cope better, should be more ‘positive’. People fear if they give voice to such emotions, they might be overwhelmed, and not able to find their way back to happiness. It’s hard to see how painful feelings could produce new growth.
Compost is nature’s ecosystem way to recycle. Ecosystems include dark, light, beauty and shit. As gardeners and permaculturists we embrace all that. How do we embrace our dark and light emotions? Not cut off our pain or joy, and treat them all as nutrients, to help us flourish?
We can take our emotions through a transformation process. Composting emotions is an inner process, in each of us; and we can help each other do this by how we relate to each other’s difficult feelings. The same approach applies equally to how we care for our own hearts, and how we care for others who are suffering.
THE COMPOST HEAP
What dies rots, and feeds new life. A compost heap or worm bin provides good conditions for rotten smelly stuff to decompose, with the help of worms and bugs, and transform efficiently into rich nutritious soil to feed the veggies.
THE HEART-COMPOST HEAP is a safe environment to support and encourage our emotional transformation process to happen. Rather than feel destroyed and overcome by difficult emotions, we can emerge happier, wiser and more loving, ready to try practical solutions to problems that might appear overwhelming.
Good places for composting are friends who know how to listen, who understand the composting process; or cocounseling, or a form of meditation which teaches us to listen to ourself deeply.
A Joanna Macy workshop is a great heart-compost bin — she’s developed safe ways to feel and express our grief and anger over climate change, environment and nuclear power. We contact the care beneath pain, and turn our strong feeling to good purpose and constructive action.
Composting is not an overnight process; it’s the same with emotions. The work may take months or years; it’s the ongoing work of a lifetime: especially now climate change and looming economic collapse present us with larger challenges than we were bred to deal with. There’s always room to extend our strength and emotional resilience.
TRUST THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESS
The essential thing that makes a safe environment for heart-composting is our trust in the transformation process. Gradually we build up experience of this, so we know it works. We may never fully comprehend it — the human psyche is deep and wise beyond our conscious understanding.
In this safe environment of trust, we can allow anger, grief and loneliness to be seen, let ourselves feel the feelings, and perhaps express it to trusted friends or counsellors.
We don’t indulge in blame and ranting. We don’t hurt anyone. We don’t express anger, or whatever emotion it is, for the hell of it. How do we treat pain in an affirming way, and be constructive about it?
WHAT ARE THE WORMS AND BUGS IN A HEART-COMPOST HEAP?
In the dark compost heap, little worms and bugs eat our rotting stuff. They are the first to be fed by it, and their enjoyment makes transformation happen. Worms are happily nourished as they process waste. That reminds us not to be goal-orientated. The results are also in the process itself, not just the freedom afterwards.
Essential conditions (worms and bugs) for heart-composting are –
Trust in the transforming process.
Treat anger, grief, misery and loneliness as a source of growth and healing: rich resources, not bad stuff to deny.
Motivation to transform it into nourishment.
Listen. Compassionate awareness is key. Affirming pain is true compassion.
In a fundamental way it’s the same for the one who experiences pain and for any person assisting. With compassionate awareness we listen to our own pain, or listen to someone else express theirs.
I’m not offering details of techniques here, such as listening skills (though it’s important to learn and practise those). This is about our attitudeto misery, and our motivation: to approach it with compassion, and affirm it so it transmutes.
For the one whose pain it is — let the pain be there — acknowledge and affirm it; allow the experience, express it. It will still hurt: notice how it hurts, stay present with it; it needs simply to be seen and felt, so the bugs can start on it.
Watch it ‘decompose’. You may feel your body physically letting go, deep sighs of relief, feeling lighter, more energy flowing in the body, new insights welling up.
As the one assisting — you may be assisting yourself, or someone else. Listen. That’s all you need to do: stay present, compassionate and open, and listen, without judging. This is the equivalent of worms and bugs eating and digesting food scraps. Listening is our digesting process.
Compassionate listening affirms the feelings. To affirm is to meet the reality: when there’s pain, there’s pain. Recognise and acknowledge it with compassion. Listening to others, or ourself, deepens our compassion; it’s a transforming process in itself, like the worms enjoying their feast.
If you’re listening to your own pain, in meditation for example, be compassionately aware of sensations in the body that go with the miseries. If you’re listening to someone else, your compassionate presence is the most important thing. What you say is extra. There are many good instructions for active listening: ‘I understand you feel this way’. Help the person simply feel the feelings, with ‘I statements’, not blaming others.
Nobody said it’s easy. Helping people with practical problems is emotionally relatively straightforward. It’s hard to stay open and kind with intense emotions, perhaps especially when it’s our own. It can feel full of peril. ‘I don’t want to feel grief and desperation, or be sympathetic to someone else’s anger. The storm might drown me. I might be overwhelmed.’ To listen to pain requires stamina and trust in the process.
COMPASSION IS THE RICH SOIL
Why would we feel frustrated or sad if we didn’t care — about the earth, about someone else, or ourselves? When we allow ourself to feel sad when whales die, it’s not hard to identify how precious they are to us. We affirm pain or anger to find the love beneath, love that makes us care enough to suffer about it. Our nutritious composted soil is compassion, love and caring.
When pain transforms, and we feel the caring within it, its locked-up power is released. We have creative energy for constructive action. It’s empowering to feel the desire to act that comes out of the emotion-transforming process. It feels juicy, like the rich soil of matured compost.
WHAT PLANTS GROW IN THE SOIL OF LOVE?
A lot — not all — of new growth and wisdom comes through pain. Also, getting in touch with our caring has practical results. We put to use the creative energy we released, explore new ways to do things, and relate to people. How do we affirm the people around us, and build robust functioning connections? How can we affirm the importance of Mother Nature? What can we do to care for her?
‘POSITIVE’, ‘NEGATIVE’ AND NEGATING (pic NEGATING MANDALA
Let’s look briefly at what happens when we don’tlet the listening-worms loose on our distresses. This is the real‘negative’.
There’s a tendency these days to want to espouse only the ‘positive’, sweetness and light. The ‘church of positivity’ calls pain and difficulties ‘negatives’, and tries to shut them out.
It can be unkind and judgemental: you should be positive, being negative is bad. How often have I been told I’m being ‘negative’, when I expressed pain? I did it trusting the transforming process; those who called me ‘negative’ didn’t see the worms feasting; they thought I was choosing to indulge in negative view, and that’s what caused me to suffer: if I stopped doing that, I’d earn more money and life would go perfectly for me.
I heard someone say recently, ‘Don’t think about climate change, we don’t want to have negative thoughts.’ That’s the new age version of heads in the sand. While we ignore climate change, it only grows worse.
This attitude mistakes what ‘negative’ is. Sure, we don’t want to be lost in unhelpful destructive thoughts. However, pain itself is not negative. The real Negative is negatingpain, trying to avoid it. Negating is denying our compost.
If we don’t compost or recycle waste, we put it into landfill, where it leaks into the groundwater and pollutes it. Or our poo: Rotorua city put its sewage into its lake, and all the lakes down the line became polluted too. My parents lived on one of those lakes, Rotoiti, so I saw the whole process. Lakeweed clogged up the water till boats couldn’t get through. So they sprayed poison, paraquat, to kill the weed, and the frogs and baby birds died too.
The same sort of thing happens when we negate and deny rotten smelly emotions. We say no no, you’re being negative, and suppress them. Shutting them out is like sending them to clog up the town sewer and be poured into some pristine lake. It wastes precious resources. We get isolated, depressed, tense, and prone to ill health: the emotional equivalent of dirty water and dead soil.
COMPASSION IS POSITIVE ABOUT ‘NEGATIVES’
A compost heap is positive. It’s positive to trust in the transforming process. We don’t have to try to be sweetness and light to affirm life. We need to be positive about so-called negatives too. It’s all part of our egosystem.
We even need to be positive and affirming when we realise we’re denying pain — and not deny that we’re denying it. Then we can begin to unravel why we feel the need to do that, and what we do to deny pain. We can explore how to befriend pain — not wallow in the mud of pain: dissolve resistance, which is the real negative, till we distil the love, and its creative power.";Permaculture Women's Guild

Lambing in 2020 was “interesting”. We came into it not only after 3 months of severe storms with high winds, flooding and even landslides in some places, but with lockdown starting due to Covid19, plus an unexpected heat wave and drought.
Juggling all these different emergencies, I forgot to get basic things ready so I decided it was time I had a list to remind me what I need to do or have ready before lambing starts.
Before lambing starts
The main decision is whether to lamb indoors or outdoors. Often this decision is made for farmers simply by the fact of not having a shed large enough to lamb indoors.
The main advantage of lambing indoors is that it’s easier to deal with emergencies quickly when the ewe is already in a pen. It also protects the newborn lambs from foxes.
The main disadvantage is the increased risk of infection.
My shed is too small to bring all the sheep in at once. I have room for about half the flock. There are a lot of foxes in my area, and restoring hedges and creating shelter-belts has a side-effect of increasing cover for foxes. As a result, I compromise by lambing outdoors unless a ewe is in difficulty, or has a history of difficulty, but bring the ewes and very young lambs indoors overnight for the first few nights until they are strong and fast enough to get away from foxes. Four or five nights indoors makes all the difference.
Even if you are lambing outdoors, get the lambing shed ready in plenty of time:
Make sure you have plenty of places along the wall to secure hurdles and pallets. A flexible system is always useful.
Make sure that any hurdles or pallets not in use are also secured well, even if you’re only putting them to one side for a couple of minutes. You don’t want to find a lamb injured or dead under a fallen pallet.
Make sure hurdles are secured top and bottom with baler cord. Don’t rely on the hurdles slotting together. Adventurous lambs and hungry ewes can dislodge hurdles and squeeze through small spaces and become trapped, separated from each other.
Use shallow buckets or buckets you can hook over a hurdle if the ewe hasn’t lambed yet. You don’t want her to drop a lamb into a bucket of water.
I use neat vinegar as it dries quickly.
In an emergency where there’s an immediate turn-around, I add sawdust or woodchip on top (pine wood in particular has some antiseptic properties), and then the bedding.
Collecting enough rat-proof feed bins saves having to make trips for more feed during lambing. Old freezers work well: watch out for them on places like freecycle.
To avoid GM ingredients, I mix my own feed. Depending on what’s available, I mix barley or rolled oats with either sugarbeet or flaked maize.
I find that molasses mixed in with the first feed immediately after lambing gives the ewes an energy boost. It’s also useful for ewes at risk of twin lamb disease.
Mineral blocks are important too, both in the run-up to lambing and afterwards. Check the ingredients: some only provide energy, not minerals, and some include GM ingredients. Find one that provides the ewes with calcium, and with any minerals that are lacking in the soil where you are.
Toolkit
Torches plus chargers or spare batteries
Alarm clock plus back-up alarm
Lubricant gel
Colostrum
Bottles, sterilising solution and a container for sterilising bottles and teats
Hot water bottle in case a lamb is really cold
Castration rings and applicator
A few different coloured sprays
Phone numbers for:
Don’t forget to watch out for ways you can help neighbours in return, especially if you’re a novice at lambing and are relying on them for back-up
Pen and paper for:
Medicines
Iodine spray, for the lambs’ navels
Twin lamb drench
Calcium injection
Antibiotics
Many farmers have some antibiotics ready in case of emergency, but this does result in some wastage once the drugs have gone past their date.
Some vets will provide antibiotics as needed, drawing up a syringe with the necessary doses, to minimise wastage (and unnecessary use)
Sharps box
Homeopathic remedies
Many farmers use homeopathy, partly as a way of reducing reliance on antibiotics.
If you don’t want to use homeopathy, simply ignore this section.
If you are interested in using homeopathy, by all means read this section but don’t use it as a prescription: go on a course! In Britain and Ireland, Homeopathy at Wellie Level are the people to contact.
Note: I am not a trained homeopath nor a vet. This list is not medical or veterinary advice.
It is a personal list of what I have found useful when I have been lambing, shared here in case it is of use to others who also use homeopathy.
Arnica: I give some to each ewe after lambing to aid recovery. If the labour has been difficult, I give Ruta and Rhus Tox as well as Arnica.
Twin lamb disease: As well as twin lamb drench and calcium injection, I use Lycopodium. When the ewe has been slow to regain any energy I’ve found Phosphoric Acid helpful.
Prolapse: As well as putting a harness on the ewe, I use Sepia.
Slow labour: I have used Caulophyllum to help when a ewe’s cervix is slow to open. Apparently it can be used in Ringwomb (when the cervix fails to open) but I’ve not used it for this (yet). Caulophyllum is the Latin name for Black Cohosh, a herb often used by women for severe period cramps.
Bleeding: I use Bufo when a ewe is bleeding after labour.
Mastitis: I use Belladonna as soon as I spot any inflammation or soreness in a ewe’s udder.
Other infections: I use Hep Sulph for most infections. If it’s a bad infection I add in Pyrogeneum and Gunpowder (the remedy, not actual gunpowder!).
When things go wrong, I use Aconite for fright, Arnica and Rescue Remedy for shock, Hep Sulph for a ewe that is stressed, angry or suspicious of me and Ignatia for grief.
Post surgery, I give Arnica plus Bellis and Staphisagria
Remedies for lambs:
I have Carbo Veg on hand for flat lambs as it has a reputation as a reviver due to its ability to promote oxygenation.
I find Aconite useful for lambs born outdoors who have gotten chilled by a cold wind.
After a difficult birth, when the lamb has had to be manipulated and pulled, I find Arnica can be useful. Following one particularly difficult birth that left the lamb with a sore shoulder I found Eupatorium helpful.
I use Arsenicum for diarrhoea, or China if there is dehydration.
Looking after yourself
Stock up on essentials such as:
Include:
Sleep
Most lambs are born either early in the morning or late at night, but of course they can be born anytime. On a large farm with a number of people sharing the work shifts can be organised so everyone gets some sleep.
Lambing on your own is a different matter.
Most small farmers and smallholders check sheep 2 hourly from early morning til late at night, and only stay up later if a ewe is showing signs of going into labour at the last check.
This is still quite tiring, and if a lot of lambs need pulling out it can get exhausting. Farmers can become run down by the end of lambing.
One solution is to teach volunteers the signs of labour and get them to do either the early or late checks, on the understanding that they must wake you if a ewe is going into labour or even if they are just not sure about something.
In the UK the National Sheep Association has a list of farms looking for help. This is often used by vet and farming students looking for experience.
During the coronavirus lockdown, of course, it isn’t possible for family members or volunteers to travel to the farm to help. Last year, I found a workable compromise was to try to head back to bed between at least one pair of the 2 hourly checks, usually in the afternoon when it was quieter.
I find that, if I’m not too tired, some gentle stretches before going to bed can help me sleep better.
Once lambing is over, there is pressure to catch up with things and rush on with other jobs. Try to make some time to rest and catch up on sleep.

We usually think of accessibility in terms of adaptations and adjustments that have to be made because a particular person has a disability and needs access. 
You can almost hear the sigh at the thought of the expense and inconvenience…
But what if we simply design places so they are already accessible to everyone?
In this article we are going to look at accessibility in a garden, but the principles and the process can be used in any space.
Even if your garden is a private space and you don’t think it needs to be accessible to anyone else, including accessibility in your design is part of planning for the future, and being prepared for changes and disasters. Don’t forget, if you are planning to live somewhere long term, that becoming less mobile and becoming disabled is often a part of growing older.
If you or someone in your family has to have a leg in plaster for 6 weeks, or develops a health issue, an accessible space can make all the difference.
It’s much easier to include accessibility in your design now, than to try to adapt the design when you are ill or in pain, and are unable to think straight or do heavy work.
Still not convinced? Think wheelbarrows!
Most garden paths need to be wide enough for a wheelbarrow, and it’s much easier to push a wheelbarrow if the path is level or gently sloping and step-free.
The simplest way to start any design is with a base map. This can be on paper or on a computer, and simply shows where everything is that can’t be moved or changed. This article by Heather Jo Flores explains how to make a base map.";Permaculture Women's Guild
"Once you have a base map you can add layers to it for different aspects of your design.
Start the accessibility part of your design by making a new layer in your maps. This can be a new layer of tracing paper or a new layer in an online programme. Either way, your base map is visible from below and doesn’t need to be re-drawn. Whew!
Mark observations about accessibility in your garden on this new layer.
At this stage simply notice things about the space. Don’t jump ahead and start planning changes or adaptations.
Try to imagine different types of needs, such as mobility difficulties, back pain, visual impairment and general weakness or fatigue. A medical diagnosis isn’t important here – it’s the accessibility needs an individual may have as a consequence of their health issue.
Note where accessibility is good as well as places that are currently difficult to access.

Things to include
Gradient of the garden. Is it on a slope?
Distance between key points in the garden.
Paths
What are the paths made of? 
Are they slippery or uneven?
How wide are they?
Are they sloping?
Path gradient
Work out how steep paths going up or downhill are.
A spirit level is useful for measuring this.
Steps
Handrails
Garden Beds
Water
Access to the garden
Having mapped out accessibility as it is at present, the next step is to make a plan for any changes you want to make to improve accessibility.
Include a plan of when changes could be made e.g. if you are making a new garden bed, that is a good time to think about the path beside it, as well as the shape, height and width of the bed.
Garden Bed Design
Think about creating a raised bed near the house so if you are incapacitated for any reason, e.g. back pain or an injury, you can still use these beds. Growing herbs and salad plants within easy reach of the kitchen is a good idea anyway for convenience, and a raised herb bed surrounded by a low sitting wall can be a relaxing spot to sit with a cuppa.
Be aware that the term raised beds is used in two different ways. It can either mean a no-dig bed where the soil is slightly higher than the path because it is mulched regularly. Or it can mean a bed that is built up anywhere from a foot to a metre or more to make it accessible. In this article I mean accessible beds.
A lot of accessible raised beds are simply the usual long straight bed made higher. But a long straight bed isn’t that easy to get around if you have mobility difficulties.
If you are making a raised bed, stop for a moment and think about what height and shape would be most useful and easily accessible.
Most raised beds are made of wood. But wood rots over time, and if it is holding a lot of soil, a rotting side to a high raised bed can be dangerous – and in wet climates they are also a haven for slugs!
Think about different materials you could use.
Re-use someone else’s waste: builder’s dumpy bags are often single use for deliveries of sand, for example, but are still strong and if used at full height may be an excellent height for someone who struggles to bend. The downside is that when the builder’s bag decays, it will shed bits of plastic into the soil.
Earth bags (like sand bags but filled with subsoil) can be used to create rounded shapes. Similarly tyres can also create interesting layouts, and have the advantage of keeping roots damp and well-insulated from frost, but the jury is still out on what chemicals may leach from them, and whether or not these are taken up by plants.
Think too about introducing some flexibility into the design by using pots and containers at least initially as this will give you a chance to try out different heights and layouts before making a more permanent raised bed.
Remember that raised beds will need to be half the width of a ground level bed if you need to be able to reach everything from one side.
A horseshoe shaped raised bed that someone can sit in the middle of means a lot less manoeuvring around than a long straight bed that has simply been made higher.
Don’t forget that not everything needs to be raised up!
Plants like raspberries, blackcurrants and cordon fruit trees usually fruit at an accessible height when planted at ground level.
Paths
Gradient
Benches
Steps
Colour
Scent
Water
Your overall design for the garden should include water anyway, as water is an essential component of any garden, and ideally will be designed so the garden rarely needs watering.
But think about water and those places that may need watering sometimes from an accessibility perspective too.
Ergonomic tools
Well designed tools are better for everyone but can make a huge difference for someone with painful joints, muscle weakness or chronic fatigue. Thrive, the gardening for health charity, have a lot of advice about tools on their website.
In a community garden, visually impaired gardeners may appreciate having a post at one end of the bed to slip the harness or lead over so they know where to find their guide dog. Providing water for support dogs may be appreciated.
Consider distances between raised beds and the toilet, and how accessible the toilet is.
Check if paths that are a dead end have space for a wheelchair user to turn round. Remember also that people need to be able to get past each other without someone working at a bed always having to move out of the way.
It’s good to encourage cyclists but do be aware that many people with disabilities will avoid walking along paths shared by cyclists and pedestrians. Consider if this might be an issue on the path leading to the entrance to the garden, and what possible solutions there might be.
Accessible design and adaptations are important but they are only one half of the story. Including people with disabilities – i.e making the garden inclusive – is also about creating a welcoming space, which also benefits people without disabilities.
Notice how easy it is to get to communal areas where people can meet and chat over a cuppa. Are communal areas in a warm sunny spot, sheltered from the wind? Is there any shade from the sun?
Inclusion is also about attitudes.
For example, are people believed when they say they can’t walk that far? Women and people of colour are often less likely to be believed when they say they are in pain or have limitations. Women of colour, bearing the brunt of both prejudices, are even less likely to be believed. Those whose condition is variable also face disbelief when they can’t do today what they did easily yesterday.
It’s also important for community projects to be mindful that many people with disabilities are aware that they are particularly vulnerable to Covid and may still be taking precautions.
Finally, use the information from your initial observations to make an accessibility statement about your design.
This is simply a short list or a clear map that tells visitors the key points about accessibility in the garden as it is right now. 
I recently visited a public building that had an accessibility statement that was several pages of small print. I couldn’t take it in, and most of it didn’t seem relevant to me anyway. I did notice that it said the ground floor was wheelchair accessible. And it was true – the layout made it very easy to get around inside. But only if you could first somehow get yourself and your wheelchair up a flight of 12 steps!
Include the Accessibility Statement in your design. Including it in the website for a community garden or public space is good practice too. Remember to update it as things change. ";Permaculture Women's Guild

At Emergent Abundance Farming Collective, we grow both annual vegetables and perennials in a diverse landscape on approximately half an acre of land. The land came with a challenge: the presence of Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense). 
In the power-over paradigm of our dominant culture, the presence of thistle can’t be tolerated. I can hear the voices in my head: Eradicate ALL weeds!! As we use a minimal tillage approach and no herbicides, I might at this point in our short history on this land have thrown up my hands high in the air – and given up.
Instead, I decided to ask questions.
What if I asked the thistle what it has to teach us?
What if I asked myself to shift my mindset? What if I didn’t call the thistle a weed, but a perennial cover-crop? What if I looked at the thistle as a living mulch plant much like comfrey which we plant intentionally in permaculture settings?
What if I took the time to observe and evaluate what the issues actually are, case by case, crop by crop?
So, what are the issues of having thistle present in a field? I can see mainly three problems: Thistle outcompetes many crops for light. Thistle outcompetes many crops for air-flow (which is a pretty crucial element in the humid summers of the mid-atlantic US). Thistle also spreads quickly into new territory, covering the soil in dense patches.
Thistle is known to be a healer of soil. It is said to disappear once the job is done. As I am a migratory farmer, I have not had the honor to be in the presence of the same land long enough to be able to verify this statement. But I am assuming that it may as well be true. And I can also deduct from it, that even in a shorter time-frame, a healing effect will be experienced. 
In my observations, annual vegetables thrive in fields that are inhabited by thistle. My sense is that the way thistle interacts with the soil creates a perfect bacterial-fungal balance and pH in the soil to promote vegetable growth.
There is more: as a perennial cover crop, thistle maintains microbial soil life by actively penetrating the soil with its roots, feeding microbes on its root-surfaces. Thistle continuously sinks carbon into the soil. Thistle promotes good soil structure, the absorption of water and the availability of air in the soil. Thistle is an engine of biomass production, which can be used right there in the field as a mulch further feeding soil life. Thistle taps deeply into the soil bringing up nutrients. Thistle is rich in silica which contributes to general plant health.
Then there are other effects, such as an early infestation with aphids on thistle which in turn invite the beneficials to the party: last year our field was buzzing with ladybugs, parasitic wasps, gall midges and lacewings by early May. From then on, we didn’t see a single aphid outbreak on any of our vegetables – while other farmers in the area had their share.
And then there are the more personal teachings: thistle tames my ego, softens me, allows me to move out of the power-over paradigm into a power-with mindset.
Befriending the thistle, with its abrasive texture, with its spines in the tips of my fingers, invites humility into my soul and into our garden space.
Since the issues stated above are real, the thistle clearly needs to be managed if we expect any yields from our vegetable crops. We can do this in a way that we can reap its benefits while managing the more problematic aspects of its presence. What exactly needs to be done, depends on the crop and the timing.
Taking the fava bean as an example. The fava bean is a fast growing sturdy plant, with large seeds that are seeded early in spring. We seed no-till, maintaining the integrity of the soil. The presence of small, re-emerging thistles creates a protective microclimate that aids the germination and protects the plants in the cool nights of early spring. When the thistle starts to outgrow the fava bean, we go through, topping the thistle with gloved hands, leaving the leaves in place to decompose. These provide nutrients to the beans and excellent soil microbial food – maintaining a beneficial bacterial-fungal ratio in the soil. This will have to be repeated every few weeks throughout the growth of the bean plants until the beans are large enough to outcompete the thistle. The work is thereby distributed relatively evenly over the course of the crops life, never requiring any back straining digging or hoeing.
For smaller plants that germinate slowly – such as carrots, it seems more appropriate to try and remove the thistle more deeply with as much root as possible – giving the carrots a head start. After that, the same method can be used as described above with the fava beans.
With respect to the third issue listed above, the ability to spread wildly into dense clusters, covercroping to provide continuous competition is very useful. The aim is not to completely eradicate it, but to keep it manageable. This is an important difference. We can accept the continuous presence of thistle in the field, fluctuating in intensity in different parts of the field throughout the years. Once thistle is present, if nothing else is planted, thistle will take over, completely dominating the land, covering the soil, claiming all. But if we seed winter rye or a clover, the thistle will still be there, but sparsely. Here and there, not spreading, not dominating.
The thistle becomes our friend, stepping in when we neglected the need for covering the soil, offering food and sustenance to many small life forms.
I am grateful for this fecund teacher – patiently helping me to integrate my thinking and my farming practices into more holistic, earth-loving, life supporting ways. And – honeybees and butterflies are grateful for the blossoms, too.

As I have traveled through Central America, I have come to recognize that part of my calling is to embody environmentalism in my lifestyle. I have seen firsthand how capitalism devastates communities. I have seen how greed for money and resources wins out at the expense of people’s livelihoods, land, and water. I have witnessed how people in the so-called “third world” are living in community and sharing resources. 
The relationship between the earth, community, and nature reflects our relationship with ourselves. 
One of our most exciting blessings is the power of choice. We choose what to eat, drink, wear, accept, say, do, make, and buy. We choose with whom we work, play, converse, dance, and date.
With such a plenitude of options, it’s sometimes difficult to make an intentional choice these days. As you consciously consume foods, clothing, and other retail products, ask yourself: Is your choice a great one for you, your family, and the planet? If you are unsure about the environmental consequences of your actions and lifestyle choices—research, discover, learn, unlearn, dig—and then choose.
I believe zero waste requires, first and foremost, an empowering shift in mentality. In opening our mind to new ways of living and regenerating, we learn to challenge the status quo and tread our own path to happiness.
As we think about old, linear systems of production—“take/consume,” “throw away,” and “out of sight, out of mind”—it is clear how this way of life pollutes the earth, leaving it much worse than we found it. Plastic, for example, takes decades to break down and even then continues to release microplastics and toxins into the environment. 
Waste can be defined as something that doesn’t have a use. The “zero waste” movement is about finding a use for everything. Focusing on waste prevention, the zero waste movement encourages the redesign of resource life cycles so that all products are reused, closing the loop and ultimately decomposing into the earth. 
Circular Economy is based on three principles:
“The circular economy is a model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible . . . . In practice, it implies reducing waste to a minimum. When a product reaches the end of its life, its materials are kept within the economy wherever possible. These can be productively used again and again, thereby creating further value.”
—European Parliament 
In a circular economy, activity builds and regenerates itself. Regeneration is about the entire cycle of life—from life to death. 
I am still on my journey to zero waste, and I get frustrated when everything is wrapped in plastic at stores. So, I try to boycott going to grocery stores as much as I can. I am happy to compost my food scraps. In our household, we produce one to three gallons of food scraps per day because we eat primarily from local farmers and our garden. Even our poop is reused! We have a “humanure” compost toilet that enables this precious waste to return to the land to fertilize our fruit trees after two years, during which time it safely decomposes back into soil. 
Our family uses eco-bricks, too. We push all our plastic waste into bottles (I like to use an empty gallon container from our laundry detergent), which become plastic-filled “bricks” we can then use to build structures. We consume our own crops, which then become poop, which we compost for two years before giving it back to the earth to nourish another cycle of food production. 
Our connection to the earth is related to everything else in our lives, and so my new book offers suggestions to regenerate yourself, your communities, and the environment.

I met Marina during the times of the Occupy movement, at Occupy Lisbon, with a very fierce voice on issues of solidarity and ecology. But we’ve seen each other here and there, long before when there was only one known Permaculture project in Portugal and we were at the forefront of the new ecological movement. In fact, we already know each other, but I think we only talk about it once or twice at a party somewhere… We met again on Facebook because I looked up her project to get some information and I needed help, so I found her behind Reflorestar Portugal, a project she co-founded with Susana Guimarães, her friend and business partner. I talked with her for an interview because I was amazed at her recent work.;Permaculture Women's Guild
Our paths had been synchronizing for a long time, we walked on the activism side, the ecological side, and also the alternative therapies side, going to the same school and meeting the same people. Paths that must be found are found, and that’s it. So I want to give this recognition of the work that a woman does, a mother, an activist, a businesswoman, and with a lot of ferocity to it. Our conversation had incredible energy that carried me into the next day.;Permaculture Women's Guild
Part I — November 19th, 2021;Permaculture Women's Guild
In 2017, there were major fires in Portugal that became news, the most recent ecological catastrophe here. Marina was in Australia to learn Permaculture, Syntropic Agriculture, Sociocracy, and many other things, felt a call to return to Portugal and help and found funding for a project, to start implementing “cells” of people who could support the reforestation work in Portugal. With many tribulations along the way, the project continues to work and she continues to coordinate it, alongside Susana Guimarães.;Permaculture Women's Guild
Collecting seeds is something that many of our young people are not used to, which leads us to talk about how Reflorestar Portugal wants to educate and educate people about it. They recently held an educational Reforestation action at the Primal Gathering event to educate more people about the issues we are talking about.;Permaculture Women's Guild
"We talked about how life drives us to do more for each other, because this ecological cataclysm that is happening to humanity, as Marina called it, is possibly the biggest challenge so far in terms of unity, uniting efforts, and people. We talk about how patriarchal the “world of ecological activism” is, and I keep thinking how different it feels than, say, 5 to 10 years ago, it’s still a lot like that. Paul Hawken, who, recently with the Pachamama Alliance gave a talk that I’m still looking forward to seeing the replay; he talks about 50 million people doing “the job”, Marina, I and many others are doing it. I’ve worked with soil before, but since I came to southern Portugal it took me a while to understand the cycles of an arid climate, to understand deeply how different it really is in different parts of the same country, and how the work changes absolutely accordingly, with other needs. This is obvious to us here, but to any other reader, it might not be. We might think — just put the tree on the ground, but in many situations, it takes more care than that. Knowledge about this, and much more, like the soil and its nutrition are essential.";Permaculture Women's Guild
“Besides choosing suitable trees and shrubs, local regeneration, how to prepare the hole, work with cacti… summers are very dry and tree maintenance is crucial…;Permaculture Women's Guild
so sometimes there are reforestations that work with very demanding plants, with “future trees” or “trees of the future” and if these trees are not cared for by human hands, the percentage of survival is very low.” Marina;Permaculture Women's Guild
In its Reforestation actions, Reflorestar seeks to implement the trees in places where there are “Guardians of the Earth”, local people who are dedicated to caring for and maintaining the intervened areas to increase their survival rate. Part of Reflorestar Portugal’s efforts is precisely to educate and train new Guardians with the knowledge necessary for ecological regeneration.;Permaculture Women's Guild
Marina said this is a project for the future. There is a huge need for reforestation in Portugal, but also for the inclusion of people and their natural selves in the ecosystems. That we cannot see ourselves as parasites of the ecosystem, but rather as those who guard and maintain the ecosystem in good condition. I would add that it is important to look at the reforestation approach so that we can start thinking about a more comprehensive future project in Portugal in a way that is consistent with local needs because reforestation involves all living organisms that live in the area. That’s the spirit of the thing. Ernst Gotch talks about permanent inclusion zones, where we learn to reconnect and function within the ecosystem. For the collective to be in sync, we need to work at the individual level. When we know what we do, we act within consciousness, so in the future, we can all be Earth Guardians.;Permaculture Women's Guild
I find it interesting at this point to remember how much things have changed since we discussed these issues at Occupy — the world has shifted to an ecological society, and we here at this magazine, and Marina too, are at the forefront.;Permaculture Women's Guild
Seedlings, water cycles, tree and weeds, shrubs, and the surrounding vegetation, in general, all sustain the energy and spirit of reforestation to thrive. Based on their experiences, it is always better to reforest with seed, which Marina adds is not always the quickest or most viable form of financing. Seeds know when to bloom and what to do, and forests know how to reforest according to their needs, bird migration supports this, and the more biodiversity there is, the better the reforestation process will develop. It is very interesting to note that this reforestation process takes place in synchronism with the forest itself — the communication of the trees and the water cycles are in harmony with the entire process.;Permaculture Women's Guild
Marina spent all these years dedicating herself to tuning the project to the needs of the population — “organic cells” of people who work to reforest — and also focusing on educating people to the knowledge of what it means to get their hands on the soil and understand- it to help the soil transform the seedlings into the forest. Education on this subject is one of the most important things there can be, we both agree and work on it, and above all, we agree that there is a lot of misinformation on this subject — from the health and viability of the soil, to the water cycles not being properly understood, how trees communicate and the different types of communication between trees. It’s very understandable, once you spend a lot of time working on this type of project, but if you’ve just arrived, it might be a lot to absorb.;Permaculture Women's Guild
With this, even if in a reduced diagram, we can see that water flows much more in a spiral than circular, as we are told by schools and most universities. Soil and root health remains and is often a very poorly understood problem. I continue to tell this story: there is a saying in my village, “you just have to water it and it grows”. Soil absolutely depends on water and the forest, and it also depends on the human condition to be a viable part of the ecosystem — something that is my field of work. And from there, human support, together with other support from fauna and flora, can be of immense help to understand the flows and support the reforestation process.;Permaculture Women's Guild
Fire crevices and swales are also important parts of the process. Species can be brought in by migratory birds or introduced by human hands or the wind. I have a lot to say about “invasive” species thinking, perhaps for another article. If a species exists in a given place, it exists for a reason, mostly it is about the historical context of the forest, and of course, if the species thrives, it can withstand transitions and be helping what is there in the first place. As already mentioned, there is still a lot to learn and a lot of misinformation. As an example, in a forest that has only had eucalyptus trees for 100 or 200 years, perhaps an oak tree could be considered invasive. It’s a matter of perspective. The flora changes a lot depending on the location, and the more biodiversity there is, the generally better.;Permaculture Women's Guild

Social narratives are not always congruent with the reality of things. So when we meet people like Brigid and Mattias, there’s a deep breath of sanity that runs through and showers us with a deep innate feeling of being alive.
I’ve been having a running thought in my mind about how to include sanity in my outward life, or how to show those in my immediate life what there is to know, more than it has been shown, or feels allowed to them. From dealing with decades with living in a not-so-healthy environment and finally being able to live my dream now, and start creating my own opportunities, meeting Brigid and her smile and sweet eyes of those who already breathe the-happened-change, is far-reaching into the depths of my fears into an open conclusion about the future we are building together.
After watching the film, I felt everything was already said in it. I didn’t have questions, I just wanted to know the dynamics between them and understand how to transpose that dynamism to a written text that shows how much clarity there is in living life the way life truly shows herself to us. Always beautiful, sometimes confusing, and an epiphany-giver after some dwelling on what it all means.
I felt the tenseness of first meeting someone dissipated when we started an honest and friendly dialogue of those who know what type of change needs to occur and how to make that happen, so the conversation could’ve gone on for hours on end if Mattias didn’t say “Hey guys, I need to leave in 10 minutes”.
I only asked them about what’s behind the passion of both doing films such as the Campfire Stories films, particularly this one, and what’s the passion behind living this way. I honestly felt that they were not good enough questions, but I did and do want the film to speak for itself, and to get to know them a bit better instead of the usual convo of the interviewer of a filmmaker and its “study subject” that bothers me so much.
Mattias spoke of exploration, such as intuitive guidance to the answers that he seeks to film. That something as seemingly small as the wanting to learn more about pickles opened a door to one of the most heartfelt documentaries about this subject I’ve ever seen. He spoke about their connection and the learning that takes place when people meet, and I find that this truly human connection transposes perfectly in the film — there is an acuity of being present and knowing how to be. This intuitive guidance that started with Mattias meeting Brigid out of trying to know how to make pickles turns out to translate perfectly what true regeneration means, by connecting first and exploring intuitively until there is some sort of flow of epiphanies and the learning how to be in life.
I somewhat feel that what I’ve spoken in my last 50 articles, could’ve been reduced to a mere two hundred words on Into the Soil and Mattias and Brigid.
I was truly excited to speak to Brigid, and I somewhat felt a little girl trying to ask the why’s of the world to a grown-up, I couldn’t utter actual questions, because as Brigid started speaking about her life, immediately there was a sense of flow in relation, meaning I didn’t want to ask questions anymore, I was drawn to the act of conversation and finding that beautiful meeting ground.
She said something in our conversation that I don’t think I’ll forget. She said that in her life she witnesses the “coming of life”, and I think that is one of the most beautiful ways to describe what we participate in, whatever the facet of regeneration we take part in. The coming of life for me as a spectator of Into the Soil is how the inherent natural culture of what being human means, is directly experienced as some sort of magical constant transformation that, as Brigid said, the key to it is not having a fixed destination. We just keep going, and going, and going, and participating the best we can. As the Earth revolves and creates alongside us and through us.
There is a sweetness to this film. A kind of genuinity that is not only honest as it is imperishable. I was drawn to it like a participant, not as a spectator or a mere critic. There is nothing to criticize. The sweetness I’m talking about is the inherent goodness of what it means to be human.
The wholeness of the film speaks to us about all we discuss in our gatherings and is like a lightbulb of “hey, look at this” that left me in tears when watching the film.
When we watch a film, speaking here as a filmmaker myself, I find the passing of images and the soundscape, alongside the narration of the documentary tone, can sometimes lead us to a sort of manipulation of the senses. In this case, I felt drawn in, it sparked my curiosity and my innate childish joy to be a living being. That sort of feeling is very rare in any documentary or film.
If you follow my work as a writer you know I often draw parallels into my own life, like bridges to cross into getting to certain types of mutual understanding. Here, I can only say that what I was looking for, to transpose and be clear about, what the actual future holds and what we are all building together, it’s all in this film.
So, all I have to say as a reviewer is, watch it, allow yourself to be tearful like I was, and let’s grow together like leaves, allowing the bees to rest on us, in our communities breaths, and in our blood flowing alongside the rivers. Let us count the blessings and rest on knowing that we are the future happened.";Permaculture Women's Guild

In the quest for novel but useful plants for our permaculture-based farm, I stumbled upon Northern Bayberry (Myrica Pensylvanica) which has the potential to be both a hardy addition to the landscape and provide a small source of income. While not edible, the berries of the Bayberry have the unique feature of producing a fragrant candle wax. Additionally the plant itself has a sweet aroma and the leaves can be dried and added to potpourri or dried arrangements. That was enough to sell me on the usefulness of the shrub, but it is also a nitrogen fixer, stacking yet another function for the permaculture farm.
In the early years of North American colonization the berries were used for candle-making and there was a tradition of burning one of New Year’s Eve (or Christmas Eve) for good luck. While the berries only produce a small amount of wax, the tradition requires that the candles are lit before midnight and burn themselves out after midnight in order for the “luck” to be imparted. For the fun to be enjoyed with the least hassle this suggests that these candles be very small- votive or tea-light sized so they burn themselves out quickly. This also means that the problem of the small amount of wax isn’t a conflict, unless you’re trying to produce a significant amount of candles.
Alternatively Bayberry wax can be combined with another, like soy, to produce candles that still have the Bayberry scent while stretching the wax to a greater output. With its popular scent, it can also be used in soap-making. 
Lesser known among the nitrogen fixers, Bayberry is hardy in zones 3–7 (some sources say zone 8) and tolerant of poor soils- including clay, occasional flooding and salt spray. With a mature height/spread of 3–8 feet, Bayberry can fit easily into a landscape and provide for several uses in the permaculture system.
Beyond human use, the fruit are attractive to many bird species and other small mammals. It’s noted to be deer resistant, but other reports indicate that deer like to browse the shoots, so pretty typical deer information- if they’re hungry they’ll eat it. It’s semi-evergreen in its northern range, providing winter cover for birds. 
For berry production at least three should be planted to ensure growing a female. It prefers to spread on it’s own by root suckers, is slow-growing and easy to manage with very little pruning.
Stacking nitrogen fixing, wildlife use and a cash-crop, Bayberry is a great candidate for anyone looking to diversify their plantings. The novelty of the Bayberry candle tradition offers a nice opportunity for a value-add crop that provides an income with on/off farm sales that are somewhat seasonal, but also not perishable. Once the work of boiling the ripe berries in late fall is complete the wax can be held for later candle-making. Any unharvested berries may be enjoyed by your local wildlife.";Permaculture Women's Guild

What to call the echoes of love, if not love? Why add a system to it, as if it was so mechanical that we feel confined to be binary or dissonant? “Forever” searching for the meaning of consonating ourselves in perfect harmony with life and everything living.
There’s something magical about the soil itself, it smells beautiful and it teaches us to be perfectly in tune with the love that we actually are.
People in denial about love are sometimes so stubborn to understand that when we are aggressive to one another we release the burden of connecting. Is it a burden to feel love? I don’t think so.
I don’t think loving is that difficult when we love ourselves.
I was mistakenly sent to a cult once. I subscribed to a class and I went with friends, it seemed interesting and different — about spirituality and Gnosticism. It was a cult, and it was hilarious. They have a lot of understanding about how love connects, and what disconnects us from one another.
Everyone expects perfection but we often dismiss that perfection is not about having flaws or not, is about walking the path of freedom and peace, love and compassion.
That’s why, also, when we expect friendships, we must be open to some sort of turmoil to understand what we need to consonate. I mean, the opposite of dissonance is consonance!
I found Richard Maddock, a wonderful pianist on Facebook. He plays my lullabies.
I love myself enough now to be able to tell my story sometime. It will be a beautiful book, I’m sure.
Have you noticed, those of us of good are also those of us who give love and love to everyone? Is it a mistake to love others?
We never love in detriment, but in consonance and absolute freedom.
Hmm…
Maybe the question is the offering of body, peace and patience.";Permaculture Women's Guild

Amongst other things I do for a living and for pleasure, such as studying complexity, systems, and the future in a scientific non-astrological way, I’m also a herbalist. It started more than a decade ago, I always enjoyed making my own products. Store-bought stuff was never completely pleasing and it came to a point where it actually really degraded my hair and skin. It is in fact more environmentally friendly to reuse what you can and make your own, but it just started out of curiosity over how ingredients mix to make a perfect concoction to one’s physical attributes.
Because of mental health issues, I really let myself go for a while there. At one point I was losing so much hair due to medication, my trademark curls became like this limp shower curtain. So I cut my hair above the shoulders and that helped for a while, but it was kind of limp and without the real volume of nourished aspect to it. I started investigating traditional African methods, after spending some time studying Chinese Traditional Medicine and Western Centered Herbalism, basically based on Celtic ancestry with Arabic influence, where I live. So I learned a lot about botanicals, what we call herbs and some non-sensical people refer to as weeds.
When I go walk my dogs, I stop along the way to inspect certain wildflowers or wildlings growing along the path. I usually bring some home for further investigation and it’s fun to spend some time just observing each part of the plant and thinking what I could do with it. I also do natural dye for homemade clothes but to that another article.
So I started investigating what to do with certain leftovers, like coffee that no one likes or some fruits or veggies that are beyond the eating phase, the only stuff I really needed to buy was Shea butter, Castor Oil, and Vitamine E, all the rest is easily made at home here or can be found in any supermarket. Reminder, I live in a very very small town in the interior with half an hour access to a very small city that does not have organic stores where these products are easily found. When I lived in Lisbon, it took a walking route to find these ingredients. Anyway, depending on what you’re making and if you are a Pinterest idea buff like me, you can find solutions to not having these ingredients.
My hair was really damaged by the years of product waste and neglect, so I started my own treatment done in central and south Africa for curls to stay in place, I skipped the flaxseed gel part and stayed only with the oil-creme that I use as a weekly treatment for strengthening and softening. In fact, I started really small at first, I started with simply macerated concoctions for skin, with coconut oil and hibiscus, which I really recommend for dry and aging skin. From there on out I’ve moved from skin to hair products to shampoo and conditioner. I’m not a big make-up person, but I’ll get there eventually too.
I have my own skincare, self-care routine that helps me relax after a long week and just spend some quality time taking care of myself.
I upcycle old product packaging so I don’t need to go into the mason jar buying craze, and after it’s done I simply reuse the same packaging. I started doing small things for others, osteoarthritis pain capsicum creme, or insomnia treatments, and some people come to me for advice on what to use for their skin, hair, or problem. Being a herbalist is fun because I get to be that person that complains about modern medicine and people actually trust what I say because they’ve benefited from my products. The jewel of the crown has been really the osteoarthritis pain medicine because it really is miraculous where modern medicine fails.
And the title of this article is about how these simple skin and hair products become their own justly entitled medicine. I think people, particularly those who care way too much about appearing a certain way, forget that the skin and hair are parts of the body, very needed parts of the body, and if they are constantly being filled with weird chemicals to perform circus tricks, they will become depressed and lonely, and if we rely solely on the beauty aspect of a certain beauty pattern, we often forget how to take care of ourselves.
I’ve been a bit against the whole bad smelling hippie thing, because it is really not needed to smell bad to be a hippie. A bad smelling hippie to me smells of sweat and booze and marijuana, which is fine if that’s your thing, but it’s not in any way a healthy path to take in terms of immunity and body systems support.
Just like in any other system, a body functions well when the entirety of it’s parts functions as well, and if you damage your liver and brain with too much alcohol or drugs, somewhere along the way you’ll realized you payed a heavy price for being a bad smelling hippie, when you could’ve integrated self-care routines with sweet scented hippie bar soaps. Just saying.
Anyway, with that out of the way, the whole thing about these cosmetics being part of the body’s medicine, comes with the intention that when you make your own, you’re not only doing it for yourself, but also to your own body’s needs. What your hair needs and what your skin needs, what your organs need and what your soul needs. Cosmetics as medicine comes with the caveat of making a facial tonic that protects your skin from the sun as well as helping you sleep well at night (simple Rose Water with Geranium essencial oil before bed will do the trick) and how a warm cup of matcha will help you balance your emotions in the morning before a big work day, if you still have one of those, and when the matcha is applied to the skin it can help bring out the best properties your skin has to offer to replenish itself.
So this approach of medicine cosmetics is not entirely new, in the old days cosmetics were an essential part of a medicine cabinet, and like I usually say, they also helped to ward off evil spirits — salt baths or red lipstick.
It’s really interesting how in today’s society it’s almost like this esoteric, new age thing, to do your own stuff. What I’ve come to see is that a lot of people, across genders and cultures really value this type of knowledge. So I’m writing my own little book of cosmetic medicine recipes and tips and tricks. Let me know via e-mail if you’re interested in getting a copy.
To really go into this subject it has been my favorite thing to study the whole food as medicine and cosmetics thing. As you can see above in a small bottle, there’s a little avocado oil serum with a few essential oils that are good for the skin that really helps maintain hidration. The health benefits are immense, mental health wise as well. The fact that I take the time to take care of myself, and do my own products, helps me also maintain sanity in these hard times. Doing it for others is a blessing, but mostly I do it for future generations, so this knowledge is not lost.
At home, everyone uses the same big cream that I make, that helps all skin types and makes us look like we’re just out of a very happy teenage years phase. I make big quantities of it because it’s really the most miraculous cream ever, and it really helps with both oily or dry skin to level out the essential oils of the skin itself. It’s also great for marks and a natural sunscreen.
The damage done on my hair and skin by half a decade of medication that really unbalanced my hormone levels and all kinds of weird stuff, is now being in treatment and with great benefits. I look with pity at those supermarket shelves full of weird chemical products that are used once or twice and thrown out for lack of efficacy, when it’s really easy to make your own.
The whole medicine cabinet filled with prescription med for all sorts of issues, really goes down when you use the right products for the largest organ in your body. What you choose to ingest as well as through the skin really helps with maintaining your health levels. If your routine includes taking care of your appearance in a way that is healthy, it is also taking into account the benefits of how you, as part of nature, can be in tune with what nature has to offer. If everyone thought like this, it would be a very different world.";Permaculture Women's Guild

It started in Wuhan….
Or did it?
It started with the pangolin, or the bat…
Or did it?
Or is this virus a symptom of a much larger problem? A problem that we have created over many generations, where our Earth systems are being pushed to the edge. Squeezing the life out of natural systems, wanting more for less, disconnecting ourselves from the true costs of anything and creating the conditions for the virus to morph and spread as it has.
The global industrial food machine that fills supermarket shelves brings us food without life.
This food is made in factories, the vegetables are sprayed with toxins and the animals are crammed into sheds and given antibiotics to keep them alive in such conditions. Whether it be animal or vegetable — it has been fed and altered to require the least time and inputs for the biggest outputs. Our disconnection has allowed this hideousness to grow, while our feeling of connection and belonging evaporates.
Can we account for the true cost of such a system? Poisoning the waterways, tilling the soil, erosion, shrinking wild spaces, dependence on fossil fuels, ignoring traditional methods and indigenous wisdom and so much more…?
Is there another way?
Is there a way to live which values life… and death and the cycles that continue to bring new life. Is there a way where there is no waste; where we learn from what has happened before; where ecosystems thrive and so do we. Is there a way to live on this Earth as part of it? A way where you truly get out what you put in; where you are valued for you, not because of your birth status, your bank balance, skin colour, gender, species etc.
For those of us in a position to use some of this time for thinking and growing, we must. We must reimagine how we do things on a day to day basis. Reimagining how we meet our basic needs and our community needs and making sure that corporations and governments listen.
This pandemic has made the class divide abundantly clear — when stores are sold out of basic food items like pasta and rice what happens to those of us who live week to week. With many folks losing their jobs, how do you then afford rent, or repayments. What if you don’t have a fixed address? How do you isolate at home if there is no such place? Or if that place is not safe?
There are so many flaws in our current system that it can be hard to see where to put our energies. For me, I found that the only way I can continue to wake up most days feeling any hope is to put much of my energy into the things that make me tick. Finding the places that are shifting the system and invigorating me at the same time.
For me, that’s food! Growing, foraging, gleaning, cooking, preserving, sharing… taking responsibility for some of my basic needs, getting out of the extractive capitalist system and enjoying it. I love spending time in the garden and sitting on the Earth — it invigorates me, it gives me time to listen and observe. I love spending time in the kitchen, making something delicious from the garden and farm seconds and sharing this! The sharing is such an important part of it for me. It helps me feel connected to my community, and helps me feel my community is connected to their food.";Permaculture Women's Guild

And whether you are a devoted foodie with a well-stocked fermentation station on your kitchen counter or just somebody who loves a Reuben sandwich, one of the simplest and most satisfying fermented foods to make at home is good, old-fashioned sauerkraut.
If you’ve never experimented with home ferments, homemade sauerkraut could be the gateway. It is easy to make, hard to mess up, and once you’ve got the hang of how to make a good kraut, you’ll be set up with the tools to branch out into more complex recipes like kimchi and kefir.
Myself, I prefer kraut to all the rest. I learned this recipe for homemade sauerkraut during a hands-on workshops with fermentation guru Sandor Ellix Katz, author of The Art of Fermentation and The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved. For a labyrinth of delightful fermentation recipes, visit his website www.wildfermentation.com.
Supplies:
All of your supplies should be freshly cleaned in hot water. Don’t bleach them but make sure they are free of dirt and debris.
Large stainless steel bowl
Sharp kitchen knife, not serrated
Large cutting board
A ½ gallon Mason jar, wide-mouthed
A smaller glass jar, narrow enough to fit easily into the mouth of the larger jar
A sanded and boiled 2-inch-wide, 10-inch-long wooden dowel or a clean, empty Tabasco bottle with the label removed
A clean, lightweight cotton cloth, such as a dish towel or pillowcase.
Ingredients and method:
1 large head of green cabbage
1 medium head of red cabbage
3 tablespoons non-iodized natural sea salt
(Optional ingredients could include juniper berries, radishes, daikon, carrots, garlic, horseradish, bok choy, onion, goji berries, currants, hot peppers or any range of small fruits, seeds and veggies, but I recommend starting with just a simple kraut of only cabbage and salt and then experimenting with other ingredients later on down the line.)
​Wash the cabbage, remove the largest outer leaves and set it aside. Slice the cabbages in half and carve out the small, hard core. Some people include this in the kraut, but I find it doesn’t ferment as well as the rest.
Taking your time, slice up the cabbage into very thin strips. Mix both colors into the large bowl, adding a dash of salt to each handful of cabbage.
When all of the cabbage is in the bowl, sprinkle the remainder of the salt over the top.
Squeeze and rub the cabbage with your hands, using your thumbs to work the salt into the leaves. Keep doing this until the cabbage feels wet and slippery, and the colors darken. This is the “cabbage massage” — the most important part of the kraut-making process.
DO NOT add water, vinegar, or any other liquid. This will cause your kraut to mold. Use only vegetables and salt.
Pack the cabbage into the large Mason jar, using the wooden dowel (or Tabasco bottle) to smash down each layer. If you have been thorough with your cabbage massage, a foamy liquid will start to form around the leaves as you pack them into the jar. Keep smashing and packing until all of the cabbage is rammed into the jar. Leave an inch or two of space at the top.
Rub salt on both sides of a few of the large cabbage leaves set aside at the beginning and place them over the top of the packed cabbage to create a leaf-lid that sits just under the top of the liquid level.
Now fill the smaller jar with water and seal it with a tight lid. Place this jar inside the mouth of the larger kraut jar to weigh the large leaves down on top of the kraut.
Wash and dry the steel bowl and place it under the jars to catch any liquid that overflows during the fermentation process. If you have ants, put a little water in the bottom of the bowl to trap them before they can crawl up into your kraut.
Drape your cotton cloth over the whole contraption to keep out bugs but allow in the happy ambient yeasts and bacteria that will help your kraut thrive. Keep it in a cool, dark place. Warm temperatures speed up the fermentation process, cold weather slows it down and super-hot weather could kill it.
Once or twice a day, uncover the kraut and remove the smaller jar and large lid-leaves. Smash the cabbage down. Smash, smash, smash! Wipe away any overflow liquid, replace the lid-leaves and smaller jar, and re-cover.
After about 5 days, begin tasting the kraut. My preferred flavor usually happens around 7 to 10 days. Longer fermentation time will usually yield stronger flavor and softer kraut.
Shorter time means lighter flavor and crunchier kraut. But if you let it go too long, it will get mushy and not so yummy. When it gets to the place where you love it, cap the large jar with a snug lid and refrigerate it.
If a murky film or fuzzy mold forms on the top or sides of your jars, don’t worry. Just wipe it away with a clean cloth or carefully remove it with a spoon. If the kraut seems too dry, smash it more and perhaps add a pinch more salt.
That’s it! My favorite way to eat it? Try mixing 1 part fresh kraut, 1 part chopped avocado and 1 part grated beets. Scoop this mixture into a boat of Romaine lettuce for a delectable, rainbow-colored, crunchy raw food snack.";Permaculture Women's Guild

So many times we ask ourselves: “How can we engage people?”, “Why do people seem not to care, not to be aware of the same things I see happening in the world?” or “How can we possible share a vision when what I see is each one for her own (own business, causes, interests, goals, etc.)?”
This excellent article by Khatarine Burke from the last issue of the WTR Deep Times Journal says it in simple but powerful words: we each speak from a different “frame” or story, that is our imperative: we may be coming from the personal imperative (focused on our personal or close circles needs), from our economic (focused on our financial needs and wants and those of the culture and/or community we live in), or we can choose/be empowered to embrace a bigger frame: speaking from the ecological (Earth-based) imperative, which includes the other two.
To be clear, nobody and no economy or system of any kind survives if the Earth systems (the ecology) are diminished to the point they can’t deliver what’s needed to support life. This means that no technology (no matter how advanced) and no amount of money (which is a human created, made-up system) will make us survive if the ecological systems collapse.
And they are doing exactly that: collapsing under the continuous pressure of “more”: digging for more resources and energy, pushing for more production, producing even more waste and toxicity, depleting even more the systems that support life, allowing for even more human beings to be born and more cattle and domestic animals or monocrops while less diversity and less of other species is allowed to flourish.
But not everyone understands, feels and is able to come from that imperative as a first (to be clear, we must think on any decision from an ecological imperative first, then from a social-economic one, then from a personal one, if we want not only to be sustainable and regenerative, but if we want to survive and thrive).
Why this happens?
One of the reasons is what the author shares in her article: if we are disconnected from natural systems at the emotional/spiritual/body levels and if we don’t have the basic information on how ecological systems work, we may be coming from any other frame/imperative due to ignorance and lack of connection. In these cases, reconnecting people with nature and her systems and educating them will certainly help them to see through other “lenses”. This is what permaculture, Nature-connection programs, ecopsychology, ecotherapy and similar approaches do, both at the philosophical/spiritual and the more hands-on/practical levels.
But there are other reasons, and those are the core of my concerns: there are real reasons why many speak from a personal imperative: when people’s lives and livelihoods completely depend on a complex system that is bigger than themselves, when they see (or there are, which is most cases) more challenges to change their frame than to keep it (for example, how many have the luxury of walking away from BAU/IGS (Business as Usual, Industry Growth Society) and staying safe, able to feed and protect themselves and their loved ones? How many can truly change their “worldview” and embrace the ecological imperative without risking not only being shunned, rejected or punished but risking their livelihoods and even, sometimes, their lives?
That is why as someone from the WTR program for facilitator said “we need all”. This is an “all hands on deck” situation we are in: this is not the moment to judge and leave out initiatives because they don’t seem “perfect” or systemic enough.
We need it all: we need more programs and approaches like permaculture, Nature-connection, the Work that reconnects, radical ecopsychology and its practical side: ecotherapy to be spread and become accessible to more and more individuals and communities around the world and not only to exclusive elites or the retiree-young and mostly middle-class who populate these movements…but we also need that those who can and have privilege (to access land, leave their mainstream lives and jobs behind, afford these courses, retreats and programs, etc.) use their privilege to facilitate the access to alternative ways to live and support themselves…
As Katharine wisely says in her article: “It is difficult to imagine that all of the change that is coming can be presented realistically or honestly or compassionately as an economic or personal plus.”
The reality is that there will be, and there currently are, challenges, suffering, loses and sacrifices. Anyone who comes with a story of win-win is deluded or has not been paying attention…or worse: is trying to mislead others and avoid the responsibility for what’s ahead.

Lets start with a great concept that is gaining momentum in public sectors of education: collaborative learning. Collaborative learning rests on the assumption that collaboration over competency reaches better results, to the individual and the collective, developing at the same time the competencies of each. What does this mean in practice? That the way in which children and adults collaborate can lead to better results to the proposed goal, whether it is understanding of information, whether it is collaborative notions in the workplace. Collaborative learning is a way in which through the introduction of concepts via group workshops, it is designed an idea that has metamorphed from a single individual, through other ideas of the collective. This idea is gaining ground in all sectors of education, from infancy to adult education and higher education. The premise behind it is based on solid research over developmental methodology through assessment of learning outcomes. So, a group understands concepts better, individually, than the individual working solo. This is one of the basis of the second permaculture ethic, resting on the care of the people.
An example is a course I’m taking in adult education, that focuses on team workshops and competence building through collaborative work. The results are incredibly higher than my attempts in solo work — I tried both. In any case, the idea that we can work together for a common objective is one that can be inculcated since the child’s early years.
Jumping back to the first ethics, I’ve been dabbling in a myriad of courses from philanthropic organizations, tip toeing around social entrepreneurship, theory of change, and other subjects, and one issue that I found ashtonishingly disconnected from these things is sustainability and ecology. The building the benchmarks for future social designers in the normal-people land is also building a trade in what we can accomplish and the financial abilities of each sector, which will respond to profit margins instead of results. One primary thing taught is how to build a project that, despite good results, does not fail due to lack of funding. And it always goes straight to breaking one’s back over funding.
A particularly distressing piece of information for me, is how the new generations of philantropic volunteers are distributing GMOs for free and how that is regarded in that “world” as something to be revered.
But what does this have to do with public education anyway? The truth is, the longer we take to engage the children of today in sustainable efforts, not just in taking care of the schools’ green spaces or understanding a bit about how to plant carrots, but in being actively engaged in social transformation through the SDG’s that… well… are taking 30 years to be in effect (it’s a bit laughable sure, but only because we’ve collectively given up on it, maybe not individually, but the kids of today see it as a valid solution), the longer it will take to actually implement change. Kids are eager, we’ve witness the 2019 Climate Change Protests, new 15 year old activists and we witnessed Greta saying what we want to say to the UN, but is the UN the right tree to be barking at? That’s the issue.
A complex problem exists from the fundamental level of the person, to a social level, to an institutional level, to a secotorial level, and then to the systemic level. To reach a systemic change, we need to go through all the remaining levels. And the UN is as far from the actual system than the US government allows it to be. An adolescent can understand which doors to knock on if it understands the local issues of their complex system problem, such as Climate Change. There’s no point in arguing with the UN, if the people there are already commited, but need to respond to certain institutional and sectorial aspects which are commited to the contrary.
With this we reach the first ethic: Earth Care. Getting kids involved in actual solutions. And it’s already a practice in most of our Western society, but not all, and what I mean isn’t making this solution homogeneous to each public institution, but to provide local solutions to the public sectors in education. I mean, I was writing down a project objective, and I realized it’s more of a national objective and I’m here working solo thinking I’m going to single handedly change my country’s culture? I either overestimate myself, or I need help. With the involvement of the newer generations that are more keen to understanding these issues and actually want to take a part in it, it is possible to reach our desired goals in 10, 20 years time… kids grow up and become responsible adults, at least most of them. If we teach them segregation, inaccurate history and most of all, national pride over ethics, we can’t reach any sustainable objective at all.
And there’s the tough part… since the other two are already in trial application. The fair share part of the third ethic. Two words: solidarity economies. “Ouch, you socialist!” Hear me out…
There is a bigger issue here, that is not to completely change the way we look at solidarity economies, but if covid-19 taught us anything is that we can expect a lot of good things coming from gift economy. Pay what you can, be collaborative and work on ecological matters, must be the pinacle of education anyhow, with education being free in most places, it’s genuinely a breeding ground for good permaculture ethics from the ground up.
How then to apply the third ethic to a more fair and inclusive of ecological matters, particularly in an economic perspective. For me, capital could be abolished, but I do not represent the majority of the population and to reach the majority of the population we should be deeper into what the concept of well-being and how having a fair share of what is produced, including housing, electricity, food, and education, can be through solidarity and collaborative working and learning.
It’s a way we can socially work towards equality: by working together, taking care of the earth and having solidarity between us. Inculcating these ideas in the public sectors of education, can cause more good than harm.
The issue with teaching ethics is that is a realm of Philosophy, which is not properly studied unless you follow a Philosophy major in your higher education pursuits. Besides, each public sector of education in each country has the inculcated belief system of each culture. I seriously had a History teacher trying to run me over with his car when I fought for the teaching of my country’s role in slavery in our classes. I know how hard it has been in my circle of acquaintaces to actively be engaged in changing paradigms, I’m met with silence and paternalizing comments, or complete disregard. But I haven’t put myself in an echo chamber, and maybe that’s good.
The way we attribute power is also important, I don’t deem the silencers or the paternalizing as the powerful, I deem them as people who want to change but haven’t figured out how. Nobody, except lunatics, is happy with how things are… the issue with permaculture has always been being too out of the system, too hippie, too alternative, or an alternative people are not looking for. But most available form of permaculture, the ethics, can be transversal to the human needs that are common to us all. I think that might be the best approach. Some of us are teachers, so are we willing to go the extra mile to use what’s available to make a change?
A big issue happening is how people are so adamant that this current movement of people is trying to erase history, that they have ceased to question history itself in order to defend it. These were once children who went to public and private schools and were taught their ethics through their educational methods. I remember school being a horrible place to be, but kids today are being offered more alternatives, from homeschooling to outdoor schooling, to alternative private schooling.
The biggest revolution that can happen in education, has to begin by a fresher perspective on teaching, not on the behaviors of the students. In Sociology, we study the development of an adult with a myriad of social agents, family being one and school being another, in childhood, and even groups of friends as another. The way in which we can transform society, by pressuring a systematic change, has to begin by the personal aspect, to the social, and institutional, until the sectoral and systemic fold. And if there is a time to do it, it’s now.

“In a racist society, it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be antiracist.” says Angela Davis
“You cannot be anti-racist & not be an environmentalist.
You cannot be an environmentalist without being anti-racist.” — Nicole Anasis.
Regardless of whether climate change was happening or not, dismantling racist and oppressive social structures is something we should all care about, something we all need to prioritise.
For white privileged people like myself, it shouldn’t take the pointing out of how addressing racial inequalities is the only true way to start fixing our planet, because that implies that we only care about undoing racism when it affects us personally.
Everyone should care about racial inequality because it is unjust, unfair and oppressive.
Those are the reasons we need to work to undo systems that put Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) at a disadvantage.
We must educate, donate, support, protect, respect, and be active.https://www.permaculturewomen.com/media/52e4a156b624a1b208d5eee7359b5761
Ayana Elizabeth Johnson recently published an article on the subject of how ‘racism derails our efforts to save the planet’, where she pointed out that although “black Americans are disproportionately more likely than whites to be concerned about — and affected by — the climate crisis”.
The fact that many are still fighting for their basic human rights leaves little time for full focus on environmental activism.
Structural racism, mass incarceration and state violence mean that campaigning for social justice comes at the top of the list for many black Americans who might otherwise be focusing their energies on the climate struggle: “consider the discoveries not made, the books not written, the ecosystems not protected, the art not created, the gardens not tended.”
But it is not only lack of time to organize campaigns that make environmental problems difficult for people of colour, the effects of climate change are disproportionately concentrated in places where people of colour reside.
This is no coincidence.
Nicole Anasis, who studies Environmental Geoscience and Environmental at the University of Toronto, recently delivered a TED-style talk, where she explained how marginalised communities are most likely to move into undesirable locations due to lower property value. Undesirable locations may be close to nuclear power plants, landfill sites, or in places not intentionally created for residents.
In those places residents experience a poorer quality of life — lack of public transport access means that people have to drive to and from where they live, they can’t easily walk or cycle around, and in many cases there is no local shop which means that driving is necessary. As such, health is compromised as life may be more sedentary, as well as the danger of poor air quality that is common in these places.
As well as this, pipelines built on indigenous reserves damage communities there, lowering qualities of life and endangering homes. Conservation efforts from the United Nations’ program REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation) “essentially pays developing countries to reforest their forests”, which may have positive ecological impacts, but is hugely unfair on the communities who take that burden, despite being the problem’s antithesis in the first place.
“If all lives were considered equal, we wouldn’t have an outsourcing of climate change solutions to developing countries, and have them be responsible for fixing climate change”
“If all lives were considered equal, we wouldn’t be so nonchalant about climate change” — Nicole Anasis
In her article ‘Intersectional Environmentalism: Why Environmental Justice Is Essential For A Sustainable Future’, Leah Thomas points out that “when striving to become better environmentalists, it’s also important to consider what communities are more likely to be exposed to the ramifications of climate change the fastest.”https://www.permaculturewomen.com/media/60a367dc3902250509dfdd70d4d1d184
“Globally poorer nations, that don’t have the infrastructure in place to protect themselves against natural disasters, are often the worst hit by climate change’s disastrous effects” say Ethical Unicorn in ‘Intersectionality Is Important For Environmental Activism Too’.
Many countries closer to the equator also happen to be ‘developing’ countries, so when the global temperature increases, those countries are inevitably more affected.
Natural disasters statistically affect countries who are poorer more than others, and often they do not have the money or resources to mitigate those impacts. Changing weather patterns affects rainfall, thus endangering water supplies in places like Africa, for example.
As well as donating, educating yourself and others, and talking about the subject of racism, Nicole offers another option for how we can combat the severe effects of climate change on marginalised communities.
Where possible, living a more sustainable lifestyle lessens the damage of climate change by voluntarily negating to contribute to damaging systems.
It is of course important to recognise that sustainable living can also be a privilege for some — organic, local food is often more expensive, as well as sustainable clothing brands, living in nature and being able to eat from a garden or farm.
However, it is good to remember how our personal choices do make a difference.
“You have to act as if it were possible to radically transform the world. And you have to do it all the time.”

Many people who embrace permaculture believe money is evil and want to reject it. While I certainly find numerous shortcomings with our current capitalist economic model, I also can’t help but recognize and be drawn to the rich (pun intended) wealth building resources contained in some of the key permaculture texts. The beauty of the wealth building tools that are part of our permaculture tool kit is that they help us cultivate true personal and community wealth in ways that also enrich the ecosystems which we inhabit.
I’m not talking about excessive, hoarding, or billionaire level wealth. I’m referring to that sense of enough, when you feel secure and all of your needs are met allowing you to redistribute surplus wealth in regenerative ways.
Why is it so natural in permaculture to presume and design for abundance and regeneration in our landscapes, but not our personal finances? Am I the only one that gets excited about the idea of a bunch of us finding ways to earn money doing regenerative things we enjoy that are part of the solution knowing that we are diverting that money from greedy planet-destroying billionaires and corporations in the process???
Permaculture co-originator Bill Mollison himself is quoted as once stating “..it’s no good any longer just being an organic gardener or farmer, we have to be effective financial and political units….we have to become bankers.” That’s going to be very difficult to do if we keep avoiding money.
As for my own regenerative money journey, I didn’t discover permaculture until a little over ten years ago when I was almost 40 years old. By that time I had been working and contributing to retirement accounts for about ten years. I had already moved most of the money in those accounts into socially responsible mutual funds. Even with my money in those funds though, I was still dissatisfied because it was supporting extractive companies and industries that don’t align with my permaculture values.
About the time I took my permaculture design course I read two paradigm shifting books:
The 4 Hour Workweek by Tim Ferris
and 
Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin.& Joe Dominguez
That first book opened my mind to the possibilities of designing a life and livelihood outside of an office cubicle. The second got me to recognize that time is a much more limited resource than money and that my job might actually be providing me a lot less money than I thought in exchange for my valuable time.
Then a dear friend introduced me to Mr. Money Mustache, which led me to the FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) community. Not long after that came blogs like Afford Anything, and Our Next Life. Here was an online world of people, many even in their twenties and thirties, prioritizing quality of life and peace of mind. They were optimizing their earning, spending, and investing to create work-optional lives for themselves.
The knowledge and people I was exposed to during that PDC strongly reinforced and complemented the ideas I was absorbing from those books and websites, further arming me with helpful resources and motivation to begin applying the concepts in my own life. 
I wasn’t a super earner or saver earlier in life, but I’ve always had a pretty strong aversion to debt for which I’m extremely grateful. I made it out of college in the early 90’s with minimal student loan debt by today’s standards (although it felt oppressive then). The only other debt I’ve ever carried was the mortgage on my first home in Washington, DC.
The purchase of that home in a then under-appreciated neighborhood proved to be a catalytic step in my journey to financial resilience. I was able to purchase it for only $1,500 down back in 2004 through NACA, a first time home buyers program. During most of the years I lived in that house I was working for non-profits on projects that were meaningful to me with colleagues, who became friends. But I was also dealing with some minor chronic health issues and there was a good bit of travel involved with those jobs that I felt was exacerbating them.
With all of these FIRE and lifestyle design ideas in my head I eventually honed in on the fact that my non-profit job at that time was largely funded by grants from two foundations. Each year I drafted my employer’s grant proposal for these foundations, which included funds for hiring consultants to deliver our programming. I realized that if my boss were amenable to the idea I could resign from my full-time job and write myself into their grants as a part-time consultant. This would give my employer the best of both worlds as they could hire someone to replace me and still have access to all of my knowledge, experience, and social capital in that world.
Fortunately, the senior leadership was open to the idea. This change reduced my workload to anywhere from 5 to 20 hours per week. It was more if I traveled, which I still did about once a month, but that was much more tolerable when my overall workload had decreased significantly. I was able to charge a decent amount for my consulting services, but my plan also included the additional financial security I had learned about through the FIRE blogs called househacking. I had had a bathroom installed in the basement a year prior so I moved my bed down there and rented out the upstairs of my house to a roommate.
My life continued this way for three very enjoyable years. Eventually though, I decided I wanted to leave DC to live somewhere that compelled me to be outdoors more (winters in DC are cold, gray, and windy; summers are very hot and humid) and wasn’t going to be such an expensive place to age as a single female.
I somewhat ironically settled back in St. Petersburg, FL (I had fled this city after graduating from high school and college here when it had a very different vibe and was still known as God’s waiting room) with its strong sustainable urban agriculture community and flat roads where I could easily ride my bike back and forth to my heart’s content. The proceeds from the sale of that DC house I had purchased for $1,500 down enabled this debt-averse woman to buy a house free and clear here with a little bit of a savings cushion leftover removing some major financial stress.
I was unsure how to proceed though, in my efforts to create a life of financial stability in an environmentally and socially conscious way. FIRE websites provide very clear roadmaps for people that involve investing in the stock market or building out a real estate investment portfolio, neither of which appeal to me. (Creative and ethical real estate investing does hold a lot of potential for permaculture wealth building,. I just personally do not have any interest in owning additional properties at the moment.)
Permaculture on the other hand, lacked a clear wealth building road map (Mike Hoag of Transformative Adventures and I are trying to change that!), examples of people who are managing their retirement savings in socially responsible ways, as well as deep conversations about aging/retirement planning and what a barrier to living our permaculture dreams access to healthcare can be here in the U.S.
I didn’t want to go on this learning journey alone though, so I started my blog now called Rich & Resilient Living in hopes that I could crowdsource the roadmap. One important thing I had learned about in the years after my PDC is the self directed retirement account. This type of account allows people to invest in a wide range of investments outside the stock market in a tax advantaged account. I had opened one of these accounts and started researching more socially conscious investing options outside Wall Street. I was hoping to connect through my new website with others and learn about other investing options. One of the first investments I made through my SDIRA was to purchase an ownership share of a local ten acre woman-led permaculture farm.
These little known accounts are only used by about 4% of Americans (variations also exist in the U.K., Australia, and Canada), but I’m still surprised there isn’t more discussion about these self directed retirement accounts in permaculture spaces, especially by those of us like me, who encounter permaculture after having already amassed some retirement savings. The number one asset class conventional SDIRA account holders invest in is real estate. Imagine that! We could be purchasing millions of dollars worth of conventional farmland and converting them to regenerative agriculture instead while simultaneously creating innovative land access and ownership pathways with that money in our retirement accounts instead of supporting so many unethical companies.
I also knew there were teachings and resources in the permaculture texts that would help me cultivate a broader, more expansive, and resilient base of true wealth that would benefit others as well (instead of harming them). 
One of the most well known and often taught concepts from the finances and economics petal of the permaculture flower are the 8 forms of capital. They were originally outlined by Ethan Roland Soloviev and Gregory Landua. I remembered them from my PDC and looked to them first. Over the past few years I’ve come to view these multiple forms of capital as one of the foundations for permaculture wealth building.
Once it dawned on me that we only want financial capital to access all of the other forms of capital it led me to a couple other realizations:
This message of the multiple forms of capital has also been very well received by audiences outside of permaculture. I was even invited on ChooseFI one of the most popular FIRE podcasts to discuss them. During the episode the hosts noted that I had provided them with a new vocabulary for something which they had previously lacked a way to describe.
Another helpful stepping stone along my way was delving into the work done by the group that teamed up around 2008 to establish the now defunct Financial Permaculture Institute. Ethan and Gregory were joined by other permaculture leaders including Eric Toensmeir and Jennifer English Morgan as well as investment banker Catherine Austin-Fitz, of Solari, Inc in this effort.
As Toensmeir outlined on a post about the institute on his website, financial permaculture is applying “permaculture design to create financial, economic and enterprise models that regenerate the planet.” Another insightful piece on financial permaculture by Jennifer English Morgan if your curiosity is peaked was previously published here in the Permaculture Women Magazine.
Financial permaculture though, as that group pursued it, was focused on the macro level of enterprise development (permaculture business planning), local investing, and economic development. And yes, those things are super important and related, but I was seeking a more micro level and individual approach for what I could be doing in my own life with my own money beyond reducing my consumption and sourcing from local, regenerative producers.
So I went back to the wealth and livelihood chapters in permaculture texts like Rosemary Morrow’s Earth Lover’s Guide to Permaculture, Toby Hemenway’s The Permaculture City, Mollison’s Permaculture: A Designer’s Manual, and others. And even though all of the these books referenced them, it was Mike Hoag’s blog posts and YouTube videos that really drew my attention to what I’ll call the permaculture asset classes for lack of a better term (more to come on these in the next section.).
When I read through the permaculture principles I can see how each of them applies to personal finance. Here are just a few examples – 
When I think about two basic conventional wealth building concepts…
1) Hold onto your wealth (don’t squander it)
2) Put your assets to work for you earning more wealth
… I see those same permaculture principles in action along with using and valuing renewable resources and services. If we make the right regenerative investments we too can turn our financial capital into a renewable energy of sorts.
Those asset classes that Mollison originally outlined in chapter fourteen of the Designers” Manual are key to helping us do that. Once we comprehend the distinctions between degenerative, generative, procreative, conservation, and informational assets we can get to work avoiding the assets that deplete our finances and eco-systems and prioritizing those that produce abundance for our wallets and communities without further harming people or planet. 
Just like conventionally wealthy people we can put assets to work to create more wealth. It’s just that the assets we are going to emphasize are regenerative and along with securing our own financial stability we’ll be directing the wealth on to others to ensure theirs as well.
Spreading the Permaculture Wealth
I’ve seen a fourth permaculture ethic mentioned in several spaces known as the ethic of transition. This ethic is a nod to the fact that we are pursuing our permaculture lifestyles within a larger, very imperfect world. We are all going to interact with that world and its systems to some extent so we’ll have to manage as best we can during this time of transition to a better alternative.
My approach within the realm of personal finance is to harness the relevant and more neutral tools of the current system to help evolve that better one. For example, I’m pursuing social justice investing (not philanthropy), using my investing dollars to address systemic racism. That type of involvement with money may or may not sit well with you. We’re all walking different permaculture paths.
One thing I’ve noticed when it comes to dealing with money at the individual level in permaculture is that we focus a great deal on frugality and spending less, but we’ve put very little emphasis on earning more, optimizing the wealth we do possess, and building financial abundance for ourselves and our communities.I’m a big proponent of tapping non-monetary ways to meet our needs, but I’m guessing most of us accessing the internet to read this article likely live in a place where somebody has to pay taxes on the property on which you reside. And if you live in the U.S. you may want some sort of a financial safety net given our healthcare and retirement realities here. And as I’ve mentioned before, when we access more financial capital we can distribute the surplus in regenerative ways.
Getting to a place of financial security gives a person agency and autonomy and keeps us from being beholden to a significant other, toxic family member, or employer. This is especially important for women, because in general we earn less, invest less, and have less money to fund our retirement years (which last longer since we live longer on average).
With the social and climate challenges that await society there will be ample opportunities for permaculturalists to earn money addressing those challenges and doing things they enjoy. If you’re finding yourself inclined towards entrepreneurship, but not sure what exactly you want to do check out the Permaculture Women’s pay what feels right Find Your Eco-Niche course. Gaia University’s free Regenerative Livelihood by Design course is another resource to help you get started. If you already have your business up and running, but need guidance and support to make it more regenerative or profitable then Karryn Olson of Regenepreneurs is here to help you.
If you long to increase your financial literacy or confidence in managing money by working with people who share your sustainable and regenerative values and can help you apply a more expansive view of true wealth to your life, I offer the following suggestions: ";Permaculture Women's Guild

I cannot write about racism. I cannot write about ‘us’. Much less about what we should do or they should not do. I can only know and write about myself. Is it tempting to say that I am on the right side, that I condemn the violence, the discrimination, the persistent racism and be done with it. Is this not what is expected of me as a good citizen these days?
Then why does it feel empty?
I have to write about myself. I have to know myself. I am scared, but the first question I have to ask myself is
Am I a racist?
I look up racism. The Encyclopedia Britannica says : “Racism, also called racialism, [is] any action, practice, or belief that reflects the racial worldview — the ideology that humans may be divided into separate and exclusive biological entities called “races” […]and that some races are innately superior to others.” Other dictionaries have different wordings, but again, the core idea is that a racist believes that there is such a thing as race that comes with distinctive traits and attributes and that certain races are superior to others.
I have never held such worldview and the insanity of this belief is eminent to me.
Am I not a racist?
If the Encyclopedia Britannica was my only reference, I’d be off the hook. Other dictionaries, however, talk about racial prejudice, with prejudice being a “preconceived judgment or opinion” (Merriam-Webster).
And here things becomes more complicated. We can sit together and discuss the world and it will be easy for me to see, feel and express once again the insanity of judging other people based on some arbitrary feature such as skin color, size, sex or nationality. We’re all liberal when we feel save. I have friends of all colors; I have lived in black communities; my extended family is a rainbow version of skin pigments, I have spoken out against racism. I may convince some of you, but I cannot convince myself.
Is there no trace of racism in my mind?
I remember driving to work in Kampala with my new baby. She began to cry and I stopped on the curb to breastfeed her. As I sat in my car I felt uncomfortable under the stares of people passing by. I locked the car doors and kept the windows up.
Then I began to wonder. Would I feel the same if I had stopped on a German street? Probably not. Even though I’d be much more (as in MUCH MORE) likely to have someone frown at me or even come over to my car window and tell me that I shouldn’t be doing this. But this here was not about approval or disapproval of my breastfeeding. It was about being the only white woman near and far sitting in her car with a baby in an African country that I didn’t know well.
It took conscious work. Questioning my mind and my fears. I rolled the windows down. I sat and looked out. I smiled. And the fear subsided. I was a woman sitting in a car with her baby. A woman in a community, sitting in a car with her baby. A woman surrounded by friendly, curious people in a community feeding her baby.
Where did the fear come from? I don’t know. It was there. Fear of the unknown. Fear of being the unknown. Fear of the other. Fear of being attacked for being the other. My inherent racism. The voice that told me that I was different. They were different. And that this meant there was danger.
When I lived in the Philippines, we lived in a house in a gated community and every car was checked upon entry. I didn’t see the need for all the security, I just wanted the house, because it had a big garden. I found the constant snooping around my car annoying and unnecessary, and I often drove past without stopping. The guards let me. And I felt very self-righteous and affirmed in my dedication to freedom or whatever idea I had created in my mind.
Then one day I sat down and asked myself some questions. Why did they allow me to drive past without reaction? Did I really believe it was because they honored my ‘courage’ or desire for ‘freedom’? Did I truly believe they did not stop me because they agreed with me? Or did they rather let me pass by because I was a white woman living in a big house inside the compound, and they were Filipino guards, barely making a living and afraid to lose their jobs?
What was I really doing? I put them in a situation where they had to choose between the fear of being reprimanded for not maintaining security and the fear of getting in trouble because the white woman would complain about them. The fear of the white woman won. Congratulations to me.
Would I have had the courage to drive by if the guards had been German or American guards? I do not think so. I remember the deep shame I felt when I realized what I had been doing.
On another note, I had an experience more than ten years ago, when I worked in Colombia. I had stayed with an Afro-Colombian community for a while, I lived with my friend and her family. It was a small town of poor peasants, we were eating cheese-fried bananas and sitting on the dirt road, because that was all there was to do, when the local bus passed through. Inside was a young woman with skin much lighter than the skin of everyone else in this community. She was Afro-Colombian, only lighter than the others.
We all stared at her. “Wow, she’s so white,” I thought, as she disappeared into the dust. Only then — and with a shock — did I look down at my own arms that were as white as ever. Only then did I realize that for some time I had completely forgotten that I had a different skin color than everybody else. That moment I felt a weird sense of loss and disconnection. I had reminded myself again that I was different. I was the other again.
Am I racist?
Can I say that I am not? That we are not different? Can I say that we are all the same? Can I call you my sisters and brothers? Or will you hate me for denying your experience? Will you accuse me of mockery? Will you scream into my face that I cannot be your sister because I have never felt the pain of racism? You could be right.
My whole life I have had white skin and a European passport. The only time I was harassed by police was during protests. The decision to participate in those protests was mine. I could have stayed away. I always have a choice.
Am I racist?
I have judged. I have disregarded others because of their origin. I never intended to. But I did. When I’m conscious, I see the insanity. When I’m unconscious, I have allowed it to define my actions and reactions. I wish I didn’t. I wish I wouldn’t. But this is my truth.
And the truth is the best I can offer to you.";Permaculture Women's Guild

I come along when winter is no longer around.
I thrive where others find too hard to be, but once I have made some space, the others come along.
My roots are deep and my arms embrace and dance with the challenges of what the new season has to bring.
.
I like to enjoy the kiss of the afternoon sun on my skin,
I like to hear the local news by the wind whispering them in my ears,
I like to experience the voluptuous touch of the water every time it rains,
And I love to play with the enthusiastic bees who are amused by my nectar.
.
My leaves are a bit bitter to prepare you and others for the sweetness and excitement that spring is going to bring.
I am tender, I am bitter, I am gentle and I am strong.
I am a pioneer. I am the one who opens the space for others to flourish with me, even when I am gone.
.
Some people see me as a symbol of Courage, some as a symbol of Resistance, others see me as a symbol of Stubbornness, but never mind … other people see me as a symbol of Hope.
The thing is, I am none and I am all. At the same time.
I tent to support others in making easier to understand what complexity is, making it easier to digest. Complexity is a real beauty, but sometimes it overwhelms some folks, and I am here to share some recipes when those times come, and we travel together toward complexity, one step at a time.
.
Come here, feel the sun with me. Stop a bit and lay down next to me.
Can you feel how gentle is the sun today?
Let the wind play with your hair.
Let those aunts climb your arm.
Let the bee buzz you a bit.
.
The wind has told me that the humans are more worried these days. I must say, I found it curious to feel a new kind of silence lately.
I mean, we all have different cycles, rhythms, and pace, no? And I thought that maybe your winter has come.
Are you worried?
I understand.
.
Come closer, and let me remind you of something.
Winter times can be challenging in many ways. Moments of grief and mourning are expected. But when the winter starts to fade, remember me. I will be back and so does the Spring.

Take a moment to ponder your relationship with the wild plants in your garden. Chickweed, thistle, pigweed, plantain. Cleavers, lemon balm, nettle. These not only provide forage for insects, birds, and animals, they also provide food for you.
Most of the common vegetables we enjoy in our salads, such as lettuce, carrots, parsley and mustard, were once considered weeds.
So why not let their wild kin act as volunteer herbs and vegetables?

Edible weeds taste great in a variety of recipes, and are known to be more nutritious than domesticated plants. You probably already know about a few of these, and perhaps you’ve even tried dandelion greens or purslane in your salad.
Here I offer a rundown of my favorite weeds to eat and ways I like to prepare them, organized by season.
Early Spring
Fresh Eating. You can make a delicious salad with the very early leaves of just about any of the plants listed in this article, but my favorites are dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), miner’s lettuce (Claytonia perfoliata), chickweed (Stellaria media), sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella) and purslane (Portulaca oleracea). Chop them all together with lettuce, sunflower seeds and a light vinaigrette.
Late Spring
Weedy Smoothies. When the weeds are still young but starting to taste bitter when eaten raw, try putting them in smoothies. I love a smoothie with avocado, kiwi, peeled cucumber, hemp seeds, lamb’s quarter (Chenopodium album), sheep sorrel and purslane.
Summer
Baked Weeds. Use weeds like spinach to make lasagna, enchiladas or spanikopita. Try it with lamb’s quarter, pigweed (Amaranthus palmeri), burdock (Articum lappa) and/or chickweed (Stellaria media).
Fall
Yum-Yum. Collect the large, bitter leaves of late-season dandelion, burdock and broad-leaf plantain (Plantago major). Add some long branches of lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) and pigweed. Hang them in bundles in a warm, dry space for a couple of weeks, to let them dehydrate. When dry, shuck the leaves off the stems and crumble them together with sea salt, powdered cumin and dried seaweed. Use this to sprinkle in soups, salads, salsa and everything else, to boost nutrition and aid digestion.
Winter​
Weed Pesto. Collect the earliest shoots of stinging nettle (Urtica dioica), cleavers (Galium aparine) and miner’s lettuce. Put them in a blender with olive oil, garlic, asiago and a handful of seeds from the milk thistle (Silybum marianum). Spread on fresh bread or tortillas.";Permaculture Women's Guild

This article was originally published in The Healthy Planet Magazine
The Autumn Equinox sends a signal to the backyard gardeners’ cerebral cortex, gently reminding us that the harvest season has arrived and that now is the time to be preserving and putting up food for the winter. Within just a couple of short months, the garden will once again die off for the year, becoming dormant and barren, giving the soil a time to rest. An avid gardener’s greatest bounty occurs at this time of year. The seasoned homesteaders and canners have it down to a science, putting up multiple jars of canned tomatoes, sauces, salsas, fruits, vegetables, jams and jellies. Hats off to those folks. Becoming skilled in this age old hobby requires knowledge of safety measures and temperature regulation to prevent risks of botulism and temperamental pressure canners. I would recommend taking a few classes through your local Extension Office before delving into the art of pressure canning. For beginners, it is best to stick to the basics such as hot water bath canning and freezing.
Freezing is an underutilized and excellent way to preserve your garden bounty — and it’s virtually fool-proof. Below are 4 simple suggestions:
Herbs are one of those garden glories that often get overlooked during the frenzy of harvest and canning season. Culinary herbs are not only flavorful, but are very nutritious and often highly medicinal. Common herbs and spices contain a plethora of medicinal qualities including antiseptic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. Fresh herbs of course should be properly identified and researched before being ingested medicinally. There are many contraindications such as during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Consult an herbalist to discover an herbal regimen that suits your needs.
In the meantime, start preserving your culinary herbs! Most of the herbs are at their prime right now. Don’t miss the chance to preserve that beautiful fresh herb flavor to use in all of your culinary creations throughout the winter months.
Here are some simple ways to preserve your herbs:
Drying
 Either hang bundled herbs upside down with a string in a dry place, or dry a food dehydrator. When the leaves are crisp and dry, remove from stems and store in labeled glass jars. Be sure to include the date. Once you have multiple dried herbs, you can create custom spice blends. Create a handmade label and give as gifts to friends and family.
Freezing
 One of the easiest ways to capture an herbs essence is to simply cut fresh herbs with a pair of scissors and freeze them in ice cube trays. Use fresh herbs. Cut the leaves from stems. Fill ice cube trays with water, and then place herbs into each cube space. Freeze overnight. Place frozen herb ice cubes in labeled freezer bags. These work well for adding to soups, stews or sauces.
Herbal Vinegars & Olive Oils
 Simply place clean, dry herbs in a jar of either vinegar or extra virgin olive oil. Store in airtight, labeled jars. Hardy herbs such as rosemary and thyme may stay in the jars. Remove leafy herbs such as basil and parsley after 1–2 weeks of steeping. Be sure to include the date on your label. No need to refrigerate. Use within 6 months.
Pesto
 Pesto is a simple way to prolong the freshness of herbs. Pesto can be made with any leafy herb. The basic pesto recipe is:
 2 cups of fresh herb (leaves only)
 1/4 cup of nuts (any nuts will work.
 You can also use sunflower or pumpkin seeds)
 1/4 cup of olive oil.
 A pinch of salt
 A tablespoon of lemon juice to preserve freshness.
 Combine all ingredients in a food processor until you reach desired consistency.
 Pesto can be made from basil, parsley, cilantro, chervil, dill, mint, lemon balm, as well as from lettuce, arugula, kale and chard. Pesto can also be made from wild edible weeds such as lambs quarters and chickweed. Freeze excess pesto in labeled freezer bags or in ice cube trays which can be stored in freezer bags when frozen.";Permaculture Women's Guild

Here is a quick rundown of everything you will need to make homegrown gazpacho, followed by a recipe I learned from a Native Andalusian chef. The varietal recommendations are my own, based on my experience and the flavors that I find work best.
Tomatoes.
Any tomatoes will do but for gazpacho I prefer Roma, Beefsteak and Ox-heart varieties. Or try a combination of San Marzano, Brandywine and any color Ox-heart. Black Krim also makes an excellent gazpacho. Or take the traditional route and use only Romas with the seeds and skin removed. Me, I just throw the whole tomato in. Make sure to choose the ripest, sweetest ones. Underripe tomatoes don’t yield the right texture.
Cucumbers.
Lemon cukes work great, especially the big ones that get knobby skin and start to turn green! You don’t need a lot of cucumber for a batch of gazpacho. Just find a medium-sized one, peel it, remove the seeds and toss it in. If you don’t grow lemon cukes, any salad cucumber will work just fine. Even pickling cukes. The cucumber in the gazpacho is really more for texture than flavor, so as long as you remove the skin and seeds, you’re all good.
Peppers.
Poblano are my absolute favorite pepper to use in gazpacho. I also really like Anaheim, but be sure to remove every single seed! Gazpacho is not supposed to be spicy at all. It is a soothing, nourishing summer drink for when your energy wanes on a hot afternoon. A siesta snack, as it were.
Onions.
Yellow Spanish onions are the traditional type to use. Any variety will do just fine. For a slightly different flavor, try my favorite, Red Torpedo onions. These are easy to grow in our climate, despite their large size. They don’t store quite as well as other onions, but in my experience, they never last that long anyway because they are so delicious.
Garlic.
No batch of gazpacho is complete without just a smidgen of garlic to set off the other flavors. Not surprisingly, my favorite is Spanish Roja. It just seems to have that perfect, authentic flavor. Garlic flavors vary widely and, for some reason, the subtlety of good gazpacho seems especially susceptible to ruination by too much garlic, or by the wrong kind. Experiment a little to see how you like it.
Apples.
Apples are not a traditional gazpacho ingredient, and they weren’t in that recipe I learned from my Spanish friend. But a fellow gardener who is gluten-free recommended I use apples instead of bread in the recipe, and I love it, so I include an apple tree in my gazpacho garden design. My favorite apples to use are Pink Lady, Gala and Granny Smith. Choose a fruit that is still a few days underripe. Think of the texture of hard bread.
Cilantro.
This is an optional ingredient in gazpacho, and some people don’t like cilantro at all. Evidently, it’s actually a gene in your DNA that makes cilantro taste like soap. Anyway, I love cilantro and include it here because it makes a lovely garnish. Any variety will work just fine.
All of the other ingredients in gazpacho are probably staples in your kitchen: olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper. Here’s the recipe:
Garden Gazpacho Recipe
Measurements are not exact. Add or subtract spicy ingredients to suit your taste.
10 tomatoes
1 cucumber, peeled, seeds removed
1 or 2 peppers, seeds removed
1 onion, peeled and quartered
1 apple, seeds removed and sliced OR 1 apple-sized slice of hard sourdough bread
3 cloves garlic
¼ cup balsamic vinegar
¼ cup olive oil
½ teaspoon each salt and pepper
1 sprig of cilantro
Combine salt, pepper, oil and vinegar in a bowl and marinate the sliced apple (or bread) for at least an hour. Put all ingredients in a blender and cover with just enough water to make it blend into a smoothie-like consistency. It should be drinkable through a straw. Serve over ice in chilled pint glasses and sprinkle chopped cilantro on top.

I bought these beautiful “Life Design” cards by Lisa Mcloughlin Art a few days ago and they are already becoming one of my new favourite things! — Lisa describes the cards as “a personal development companion and oracle for support and guidance” and to help “weave a different story” — the cards are created to be web like in their use and contain gorgeous images depicting permaculture design, permaculture principles, seasonal inspiration and astrological signs of psychological processes that are common to us all. A handy guidebook introducing ideas for how to use the cards for both personal and group work/use, and brief descriptions of each card’s functions is included with the card deck. I’m already starting to see how useful these cards will be for regular life planning and reflection, along with project designing too.

“How can we be build a new world when people are so deeply damaged by the old?”
 
City of Refuge is Starhawk’s powerful and profound sequel to the Fifth Sacred Thing. It’s actually the 3rd novel of the story that begins in the 1960’s in Walking To Mercury. Although there is been a gap of over 20 years since Fifth Sacred Thing was published It expertly flows to take up the story as if it were written to further the tale of a much more recent novel.
 
Set in California 2049, the scene is set of a land of great contrasts. Califia in the North, protects the Elements, the four sacred things –air, fire, water, and earth — and values diversity, community, sharing power and responsibility. The Southlands are ruled by a fascist regime in which a small minority hold financial control, children are bred to be soldiers and disposable sex slaves — and rape is a seen as a reward. The lands and communities of the South are toxic and dying, those in the North resilient and abundantly diverse.
 
It’s a novel for anyone who is passionate about the future of our Earth and her communities. Starhawk tells the story through and in, webs and connections, of love, power and magic. She brings us hope through the many examples of solutions of healing and regeneration described . Although fiction, City of Refuge is so relevant to real life — hauntingly so at times. The challenge of inciting revolution in such a society as the Southlands, by building a city of refuge within it, is an ethically complex task for revolutionaries of the North . It is hugely inspiring to all of us who are working hard to create social and environmental change.
 
Many of the most horrifying elements of the book (violence and oppression of both land and people), are so, because they are not far in reality to the world we live in today. In comparison, the story also holds many beautiful descriptions of what large scale communities and land use designed with permaculture principles and ethics, can be like. Starhawk’s fiction is a deeply inspiring look at what is actually possible for a solutions focused healthy future.
 
In the afterword of the book, Starhawk summarises how the changes in our world over the last twenty years have influenced her thinking as an activist, ecofeminist, pagan and teacher and then how she approached writing the book. One major factor is that California Is now year on year living the very real impact of climate change, which was still only a growing concept in the early 90’s when the Fifth Sacred Thing was written. Another challenging subject explored well in the book is Non Violence and its place in a healing world — given the severity of aggression used to control whole communities here in 2016, is it truly possible for the story’s Army of Liberation to use non violent only tactics?
 
City of Refuge can certainly be enjoyed as a stand alone book and by folk who have never heard of permaculture. There are also many beautiful layers that we as permaculture designers and practitioners will appreciate to a new level as the story weaves through the principles, ethics and many, many design elements and systems as a permaculture designer and activist, I find everything I love in this novel: powerful story-telling toward a different and better future, deep respect for the power of growing and sharing health promoting food, liberated sexual images and identities, genuine love and care for the characters and plenty of plot twists which meant I really didn’t want the story to end .
 
 Starhawks work has been a major influence in my life since my teens and I’ve been looking forward to the City of Refuge ever since I knew of its creation. In all honesty I can say its one of the best novels I’ve ever read. My reactions to the story line: — fear, horror, humour, hope, pride, determination and extreme grief changed from one hour to the next — the 650 page book was hard to put down! I’m now looking forward to re reading both Walking to Mercury and The Fifth Sacred Thing, before taking my time with a more slower, thoughtful read of City of Refuge again. I know those creative layers hold many more pause times for reflection, visioning and designing for healing our broken Earth.

Having followed the journey of Sarah Spencer’s course, workshops and training about using principles from nature, tress specifically, to navigate and thrive in our lives, I was really excited when I found out that she was also writing a book about the same topic. And I’ve not been disappointed. Think Like a Tree, the book, is a beautiful and incredibly informative tool for us all.
The 42 short chapters are brimming with examples of trees from many parts of Earth, alongside every day case studies and ideas of how the nature principles taught to us by the presence of trees, can positively impact on our lives as individuals and within our communities. Each chapter covering one principle, are divided into 6 Groups — Observation, Purpose, Surroundings, Connection, Resilience, Future. There is a lot of information for each principle, as well as some really thought provoking exercises to undertake. I really enjoyed reading about 1 principle each evening and I can recommend this approach in order to take time to absorb and reflect on the details presented.
Sarah’s work with Think Like a Tree has been very much linked to her life through living as well as possible with Chronic Illness. This theme is evident throughout the book and means that Think Like a Tree could be particularly useful to others in similar situations.
Sarah claims that “Nature holds the secret to your happiness, health and wellbeing — Think Like a Tree guides you to discover your own personal route to happiness, health, success and fulfilment — whatever your circumstances” — and I agree that this part ecology, part sociology, part history and part self coaching tool lends itself to being a useful and meaningful book for a diverse audience.";Permaculture Women's Guild

The Permaculture Design Companion by Jasmine Dale is a very beautiful new permaculture resource, in many ways. Based on Jasmine’s 20 years of experience of teaching and mentoring over 1000 permaculture students from her home at Llammas Eco Village in Wales, her book is a brimming treasure chest of diverse permaculture design tools, process and principles.
 
The Permaculture Design Companion itself is designed to be a workbook and literally a companion to guide and mentor us through a personal permaculture project. Although this is one of the main intentions of the book, I can already see how the individual sections as stand alone topics will be incredibly useful for many of us too. Jasmine’s written communication style is chatty and fun, while consistently demonstrating her obvious in-depth diverse knowledge and experience both as a permaculture designer and teacher.
The physical layout of the Permaculture Design Companion is something that I immediately connected to with it’s A4 size, relaxed font, and its many, many gorgeous diagrams, illustrations and spaces to make notes throughout.
 
The book is very much focused on using permaculture to design land based/physical projects but one of its many pluses is how it consistently weaves the connection of people involved to the physical space of the design. I particularly like the section about making sure that our wellbeing as the designer of the project is well supported and valued as being central to a successful design.
 
The Permaculture Design Companion is aimed at both folk who are brand new to permaculture and also to more experienced practitioners, and I whole heartedly agree with this. Having quite a few years of permaculture design experience now myself, I continuously learnt about new ideas and approaches to the many aspects of permaculture design, as I read and engaged with the exercises.
 
The Permaculture Design Companion is yet another fantastic new book from Permanent Publications and like so much of their work, would make a wonderful present and life tool for ourselves and the people we connect with. I’m going to be starting a new garden design within the next few months and really looking forward to testing out this fantastic new permaculture resource throughout the process.

Simply put, you make a base map is by drawing lines on a grid that mark out the property lines, permanent structures, and main pathways on your site. The base map is just that: the base of your design.
Watch this short video for more explanation and some examples:
There is no one way to do it. You kind of just have to jump in and get it done however makes sense to you. If you were making a painting, you would sketch out the outlines first, right? That’s all the base map is, it’s a sketch of the outlines. To give you something to design onto, in 2D space.
From there, the rest of your design is built as layers onto the same base map. You can even just draw it once and make photo copies, if you want to work in analog space. Or use the base map as the bottom layer of your digital project.
Your base map should contain: 
Base mapping can be useful for non land-based projects as well. If you are re-designing something, make a visual representation of what is there first. For instance, if you want to redesign your daily schedule, write down what actually happens right now. This will give you something to build from. If it is a new business, make a map of existing businesses in your area. 
As you work through these topical modules, you’ll add layers to the map as needed. If we just put all the information on the base map it would get too messy and we can’t really see what is going on. By putting them on separate pages we can combine just a few of them at a time to start seeing trends. If you’re working digitally, these will be transparent layers in your document. If working with analog tools, layers usually show up as tracing paper overlays and/or multiple photocopies of the base map, each with a different set of information.
Pro-tips for beginner base-mappers:
1. You may be able to acquire the “as-built,” or “plat map” for your house. Ask the city or your landlord. If you don’t have an as-built, the next best thing is to use google maps to print out and trace or make a digital copy. Other starting places include satellite imagery, recent aerial photos, agricultural maps (soil and water conservation district), department of natural resources maps, or other governmental sources.
2. Use a measuring wheel. Not a measuring tape. Invest in a rolling tape with a long handle that you roll on the ground. This will give you a much more accurate reading than if you try to stretch a builder’s tape across the land.
3. Use a compass. The directions matter. Use them, mark them, understand how they relate to the sectors and, by extension, your design.
3. Be precise. A square centimeter of space on your base map could translate to several square meters of physical space on your site. The more precise you can be in your mapping, the less energy you will spend on corrections during implementation. Once you rough out the main areas, take the time to go back in and fix the details.
4. Use digital tools. All of the above tips, and more, become much easier when you use digital tools to create your multi-layered designs. This might be easier (and cheaper) than you think it is!
As you may already know, this link will lead you to a plethora of tutorials.
Here’s one about how to use Google Maps to measure distances on your landscape
And here’s one, for more analog thinkers, about how to learn your pace length. This will be a huge help when you need estimate distances on a landscape, on the fly. ";Permaculture Women's Guild

I am fortunate to have just spent four wonderful years living in Australia. As an American, living abroad opened my eyes to an, albeit similar, new way of life. My cultural assimilation involved brekkie, footy, and a deeper reverence for the natural wonders that make Australia truly special.
Through much of Australia’s recent history, these natural wonders have been under threat. The Great Barrier Reef is dying. Australia is considered a “deforestation hotspot.” Aside from Antartica, Australia is the world’s driest continent. The country is somewhat frequently ravaged by bushfires and droughts.
Shortly after arriving in the country, I became familiar with names like “Ash Wednesday,” “Black Saturday,” and “Millennium Drought.” I heard tales of the devastation caused by these events. But through these tales, I also heard stories of resilience.
When many cities were faced with drought during the first decade of the century, the response was noteworthy. Melbournians were quick to invest in rainwater tanks. They adopted practices like using a bucket to collect shower water for the garden. Local governments turned to recycled water and provided rebate programs for greywater systems. People reported their neighbors when they were seen using water to unnecessarily water their lawn or clean their cars.
Point is, they did what they needed to to reduce their water consumption. By 2010, Melbourne residents had halved their water consumption, based on 1997 levels.
I’m reminded of all of this as I see and hear about what’s going on currently in the Land Down Under. The poor continent is being absolutely devastated by bushfires.
I’m not going to regurgitate horrific statistics regarding homes and lives lost, hectares covered, and abysmal words that spew out of the Prime Minister. I’d like to instead focus on how ‘Straya is showing the rest of the world how to be resilient, even during the most catastrophic of disasters.
Amidst the tears and shocking photos, it’s hard to find a silver lining. There’s a heaviness that fills the air when hearing the most recent updates or seeing photos of fire and smoke. But events like these will become more and more common. And without community resilience, we don’t stand a chance in dealing with them.
One of the main goals of permaculture is resilience, not only in biological ecosystems, but human ones as well. Care for people becomes all the more important during times of disaster. Things look pretty bleak for much of the Australian continent right now. But they would be much worse without that knitted kangaroo pouch, donated holiday home for evacuees, or free meal provided to firefighters.
Climate change will certainly bring about challenges. But, if we look at it the right way, it’s also bringing about opportunities for connection and a shared sense of humanity.
I’d challenge you to not get bogged down by the seemingly endless shots of fire and smoke. Instead, use these images and news stories as an invitation, an invitation to help out fellow humans. When you hear about hectares destroyed, think about what you can do to protect land close to you. Use stories of kangaroos and koalas to think about making choices to save the living beings in your area. Find inspiration in the videos of people being evacuated from burning beaches. Think about the warming of our planet, and what steps you can take to reduce your carbon footprint.";Permaculture Women's Guild

Technology is certainly not what we lack in western society. Communication, construction, agricultural, and digital technologies have enabled us to extend our abilities far beyond what many of us could have imagined. We easily communicate with people on the other side of the planet, we harness energy from the sun to power cars, we perform heart transplants and grow thousands of pounds of produce to feed millions. Our application of science to solve any problem we’ve encountered has been impressive.
Yet, just as technology has changed the way we interact with our world, it has also had a detrimental and irreversible impact on it.
The ecological crises that we are facing today are very much related to the fact that our technologies are out of scale with what the planet can support. When entities are out of scale, natural patterns in the landscape are disrupted. Combine harvesters allow us to cultivate extensive monocultures, leading to soil erosion and topsoil depletion. Advances in digital technology, coupled with consumerism and a global economy, mine the earth of natural resources, create tons of electronic waste in our landfills, and make us slaves to e-mails and twitter feeds.
We’ve now gone so far beyond what is appropriate for our culture, for our health, and for the planet that it is time to bring technology back to scale. Today, instead of making our lives simpler and more convenient, technology has disconnected us from what is most important — connection to land, connection to people and connection to place.
That is why an understanding of appropriate technology and its application to our lives is an important step in bringing us back into balance and back to the scale of what our planet can support. Just as we are returning to growing our own food, appropriate technologies represent more tools in the toolbox of adapting to a slow descent economy.
From rocket mass heaters, to solar ovens, to cob ovens and root cellars, countless examples of appropriate technology are experiencing a resurgence as the western world looks towards reducing its consumption and dependence on fossil fuels.
Appropriate technology solutions are intended to be the simplest solution to the problem at hand.
In this way, appropriate technology and permaculture design go hand in hand. Remember that permaculture is a design approach that meets our food, energy, shelter and other needs. Through appropriate technology, we are engineering ways in which to meet those needs in the simplest, most locally based ways possible.
Want to learn more about appropriate technology? I am excited to be teaching and expanding on this topic through the Appropriate Technology Module of the Women’s Online Permaculture Design Course. I would love to have you join me for this amazing course taught by a fantastic and experienced group of women. Check out a sample video below of what I teach in the module! This is one of dozens of videos, resources, and handouts that you will receive when you sign up for the course. This is a phenomenal opportunity to get an in-depth education, not only about appropriate technology, but about all aspects of permaculture design. From gardening to soil-building, to food forests, to water capture and social systems design, this course will give you the tools you need to create a more resilient and abundant life!
 
I was always interested in nature and gardening. This course opened my eyes about how farming should be done and how we should observe and mimic nature for healthier relationships between ourselves, each other and nature.
 
It”s not the end – it”s just the beginning! I had a great time in this course, being able to take my time to dive deep into the topics I wanted to learn more about, stumbling over even more different perspectives and ideas than I had exspected, feeling overwhelmed once in a while, but enjoying the whole journey after all.
 
During the past year, P
 
I found this course to be very rich. I appreciated the many teachers and their many perspectives. The focus on empowering women in the permaculture world was inspiring to me and I chose to drop another online course that I was enrolled in to enroll in this one. My biggest takeaway from the course is developing my capacity for systems thinking. I am now applying this model of thinking to many areas of my life to great benefit.
 
Hi there wow, what a journey! I originally started this course to improve my knowledge on permaculture pure to help design my garden, instead it helped me design so much more and gave me the confidence to strive to make a positive difference in my local community. Just do the course it will be so much more than you originally imagined. Good luck on your journey.
 
I came across permaculture just relatively recently. I had been interested in organic growing and companion planting for some time, but I had to put my interest in gardening to rest, for various reasons for a few years, until we got our allotment in 2020. What this course made me realise though, is the importance of the social aspect, which has a particular relevance to me being involved in various community projects and I have started to observe the patterns and connections myself. There is still a lot to learn, but I got new perspectives and ideas to explore in the near future.";Permaculture Women's Guild
